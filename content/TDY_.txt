customers 

we have a large number of customers in the various industries we serve no commercial customer in 2021 or 2020 accounted for more than 3 of total net sales or more than 10 of any segment’s net sales 

sales to international customers accounted for approximately 47 of total sales in 2021 compared with 45 in 2020 in both 2021 and 2020 we sold products to customers in over 100 foreign countries approximately 90 of our net sales to international customers during 2021 were made to customers in 30 foreign countries in 2021 the top five countries for sales to international customers ranked by net sales were china the united kingdom germany japan and france and represented approximately 20 of our total net sales 

approximately 26 of our total net sales for both 2021 and 2020 were derived from contracts with agencies of and prime contractors to the us government information on our sales to the us government including direct sales as a prime contractor and indirect sales as a subcontractor is as follows in millions 

our principal us government customer is the us department of defense which totaled approximately 8766 million and 5784 million of our total net sales for 2021 and 2020 respectively in 2021 and 2020 our largest program with the us government was the mission operations and integration “moi” contract with the nasa marshall space flight center which represented 10 and 15 of our total net sales respectively 

as described in greater detail under item 1a risk factors of this form 10k there are risks associated with doing business with the us government in 2021 approximately 76 of our us government prime contracts and subcontracts were fixedprice type contracts compared to 67 in 2020 under these types of contracts we bear the inherent risk that actual performance cost may exceed the fixed contract price such contracts are typically not subject to renegotiation of profits if we fail to anticipate technical problems estimate costs accurately or control costs during performance additionally us government contracts are subject to termination by the us government at its convenience without identification of any 

default when contracts are terminated for convenience we can recover costs incurred or committed settlement expenses and profit on work completed prior to termination we had no us government contracts terminated for convenience or default in 2021 or 2020 

many of our government contracts are awarded after a competitive bidding process in which we seek to emphasize our ability to provide superior products and technical solutions in addition to competitive pricing 

raw materials and suppliers 

generally most raw materials used in our operations are readily available however during 2021 we experienced supply chain constraints and price volatility on some raw materials while the current supply chain constraints have not significantly affected our business to reduce current and future supply disruptions we have implemented shortterm and longterm supplier actions to reduce disruptions and prioritize mitigation some raw materials are purchased from a limited set of suppliers including international sources due to technical capability price and other factors we leverage our existing supplier relationships and are not dependent on any one supplier for a material amount of our purchases prices of certain key raw materials and electronic components are expected to fluctuate in the future we mitigate raw material cost increases with longterm supply agreements customer price increases and isolating the market driven raw material component of the products we buy we anticipate that supply chain constraints for some raw materials will continue in 2022 however we believe our shortterm and longterm supplier actions position us well to mitigate and reduce the impact these factors may have on our businesses 

marketing 

our sales and marketing approach varies by segment and by products within our segments a shared fundamental tenet is the commitment to work closely with our customers to understand their needs with an aim to secure preferred supplier and longerterm relationships given the technical nature of our products we conduct our domestic and international marketing 

activities through a direct internal sales force as well as thirdparty sales representatives and distributors both in the united 

states and in other countries 

competition 

because of the diversity of products sold and the number of markets we serve we encounter a wide variety of 

competitors none of which we believe offer the same product and service lines or serve all of the same markets as we do although we have certain advantages that we believe help us compete effectively in our markets each of our markets is highly competitive with regard to our defense businesses it is common in the defense industry for work on programs to be shared among several companies including competitors our businesses vigorously compete on quality product performance and reliability technical expertise price and service many of our competitors have and potential competitors could have greater name recognition a larger installed base of products more extensive engineering manufacturing marketing and distribution capabilities and greater financial technological and personnel resources than we do 

intellectual property 

we own and control various intellectual property rights including patents trade secrets confidential information trademarks trade names and copyrights we are licensed to use certain patents technology and other intellectual property rights owned and controlled by others similarly other companies are licensed to use certain patents technology and other intellectual property rights owned and controlled by us we do not consider any single patent or trademark or any group 

of them essential either to teledyne’s business as a whole or to any one of our reportable segments the annual royalties 

received or paid under license agreements are not significant to any of our reportable segments or to teledyne’s overall 

operations 

patents patent applications and license agreements will expire or terminate over time by operation of law in accordance with their terms or otherwise we do not expect the expiration or termination of these patents patent applications and license agreements to have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

environment and other government regulations 

information with respect to environmental matters is set forth under “other matters – environmental” of “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of results of operation and financial condition” and note 14 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this form 10k no material capital expenditures relating to environmental or other government regulatory compliance are presently anticipated

 item 1a risk factors tableend

risk factors 

the following discussion sets forth the material risk factors that could affect teledyne’s financial condition and 

operations you should not consider any descriptions of these factors to be a complete set of all potential risks that could affect 

teledyne any of the risk factors discussed below could by itself or combined with other factors materially and adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition competitive position or reputation including materially increasing expenses or decreasing revenues which could result in material losses or a decrease in earnings 

risks related to the 2021 acquisition of flir 

flir is our largest acquisition to date and our business could be adversely affected if we do not manage the business effectively or if we fail to realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition 

on may 14 2021 we acquired flir in a cash and stock transaction valued at approximately 81 billion including net debt our largest to date flir designs develops manufactures markets and distributes technologies that enhance perception and awareness flir provides innovative sensing solutions through thermal imaging visiblelight imaging video analytics measurement and diagnostic and advanced threat detection systems flir offers a diversified portfolio that serves a number of applications in government and defense industrial and commercial markets flir is part of the digital imaging segment 

while many of the products made and markets served by flir are complementary to teledyne the acquisition of flir expanded the size of our digital imaging segment relative to our other segments for the 2021 fiscal year teledyne’s digital imaging segment constituted 52 of our net sales compared to 32 for the 2020 fiscal year continued innovation and research and development efforts will be required to maintain flir’s leadership position in imaging products there are numerous risk and uncertainties associated with the acquisition and its integration including 

• teledyne’s and flir’s existing business relationships with third parties may be disrupted due to uncertainty associated with the acquisition which could have an adverse effect on the results of operations cash flows and financial position of the combined company 

• unplanned future events and conditions could reduce or delay the accretion to earnings that is currently projected by us in connection with the acquisition 

• we may fail to realize the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the transaction which could adversely affect the value of our common stock 

• the future results of the combined company may be adversely impacted if we do not effectively manage the operations of flir which includes jurisdictions in which teledyne did not have operations 

• both teledyne and flir may have difficulty retaining motivating and attracting executives and other employees in light of the acquisition including those experienced with postacquisition integration and failure to do so could seriously harm the combined company 

• the market price of our common stock may decline as a result of the acquisition if among other things the combined company does not achieve the perceived benefits of the acquisition as rapidly or to the extent anticipated by financial or industry analysts or if the effect of the acquisition on the combined company’s financial results is not consistent with the expectations of financial or industry analysts 

adverse findings in matters related flir’s historical export control practices could materially impact us 

on april 24 2018 flir entered into a consent agreement with the united states department of state’s directorate of defense trade controls to resolve allegations regarding the unauthorized export of technical data and defense services to dual and third country nationals in certain of flir’s facilities the failure to properly use and manage export licenses and export authorizations and failures to report certain payments under 22 cfr part 130 in potential violation of international traffic in arms regulations “itar” the consent agreement has a fouryear term and provides for i a civil penalty of 300 million with 150 million of this amount suspended on the condition that the funds have or will be used for departmentapproved consent agreement remedial compliance measures ii the appointment of an external special compliance official to oversee compliance with the consent agreement and the itar iii two external audits of our itar compliance program and iv continued implementation of ongoing remedial compliance measures and additional remedial compliance measures related to automated systems and itar compliance policies procedures and training while flir has enhanced its trade compliance program more broadly implemented and continues to implement remedial measures and completed two external audits of flir’s itar compliance program additional adverse disclosures and findings could materially cause incurrence of additional expenses in connection with implementation of remedial measures and result in a substantial adjustment to our revenue and net income as of january 2 2022 under the consent agreement 35 million remains to be paid by april 24 2022 flir’s investments to date in remedial compliance measures have been more than sufficient to cover the 150 million suspension amount 

in june 2017 the bureau of industry and security “bis” of the united states department of commerce informed flir of additional export licensing requirements that restricted flir’s ability to sell certain thermal products without a license to customers in china not identified on a list maintained by the united states department of commerce this action was precipitated by concerns of sale without a license or potential diversion of some of flir’s products to prohibited end users and to countries subject to economic and other sanctions implemented by the united states bis subsequently favorably modified these restrictions to reduce the applicability of the restrictions to sales of flirs tau camera cores as opposed to finished products containing tau camera cores to customers in china not identified on a list maintained by the united states department of commerce and persons in a country other than those in the export administration regulations “ear” country group a5 supplement no 1 to part 740 of the ear flir has identified certain shipments that potentially violate these license requirements and voluntarily disclosed this matter to bis 

in april 2021 flir resolved allegations of misrepresentations made to bis between november 2012 and december 2013 in a commodity jurisdiction request relating to its newly developed lepton uncooled focal plane arrays by an administrative settlement and fine of 03 million and agreeing to perform two internal audits of its ear export compliance programs the first internal audit has been completed and pursuant to flir’s findings as a result of certain findings flir submitted one voluntary selfdisclosure to report potential violations 

flir has made other voluntary disclosures to the us department of commerce including to bis with respect to the shipments of products from nonus jurisdictions which were not authorized due to a potentially incorrect de minimis calculation methodology under section 7344 and supplement no 2 of the ear 

at this time based on available information we are unable to reasonably estimate the time it may take to resolve these matters or the amount or range of potential loss penalty or other government action if any that may be incurred in connection with these matters however an unfavorable outcome could result in substantial fines and penalties or loss or suspension of export privileges or of particular authorizations that could be material to the company’s financial position results of operations or cash flows in and following the period in which such an outcome becomes estimable or known 

the final acquisition accounting adjustments for these matters may be materially different as teledyne obtains additional information on these matters and as additional information is made known during the postacquisition measurement period 

risks related to our indebtedness 

our indebtedness and any failure to comply with our covenants that apply to our indebtedness could materially and 

adversely affect our business 

as of january 2 2022 we had 35000 million total outstanding indebtedness in senior notes 5056 million in term loans and 1250 million outstanding under our 11500 million floating rate credit facility teledyne incurred a significant amount of indebtedness in connection with the financing of the flir acquisition we also incurred additional indebtedness through the planned assumption of flir’s existing senior notes the use of indebtedness to finance the acquisition reduced our liquidity and caused us to place more reliance on cash generated from operations to pay principal and interest on our debt thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow for operating activities and capital expenditure needs or to pursue other potential strategic plans the agreements we entered into with respect to our indebtedness including the agreements we entered into to finance the flir acquisition and in connection with the assumption of flir’s existing senior notes contain negative covenants that subject to certain exceptions include limitations on indebtedness liens dispositions investments and mergers and other fundamental changes our ability to comply with these negative covenants can be affected by events beyond our control the indebtedness and these negative covenants may also have the effect among other things of limiting our ability to obtain additional financing if needed reducing the funds available to make acquisitions capital expenditures or reducing our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business or market conditions and making us more vulnerable to economic downturns and adverse competitive and industry conditions in addition a breach of the negative covenants could result in an event of default with respect to the indebtedness which if not cured or waived could result in the indebtedness becoming immediately due and payable and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or operating results our indebtedness also exposes us to interest rate risk since a portion of our debt obligations are at variable rates 

we may not be able to service our debt obligations 

our ability to meet our expense and debt service obligations will depend on our future performance including the cash we generate from operating activities which will be affected by financial business economic and other factors including potential changes in laws or regulations industry conditions industry supply and demand balance customer preferences the success of our products and pressure from competitors if we are unable to meet our debt service obligations or should we fail to comply with our financial and other negative covenants contained in the agreements governing our indebtedness we may be required to refinance all or part of our debt sell important strategic assets at unfavorable prices incur additional indebtedness or issue common stock or other equity securities we may not be able to at any given time refinance our debt sell assets incur additional indebtedness or issue equity securities on terms acceptable to us in amounts sufficient to meet our needs if we are able to raise additional funds through the issuance of equity securities such issuance would also result in dilution to our stockholders our inability to service our obligations or refinance our debt could have a material and adverse effect on our business financial condition or operating results in addition our debt obligations may limit our ability to make required investments in capacity technology or other areas of our business which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or operating results 

the credit rating of teledyne could be downgraded which may increase borrowing costs 

there can be no assurance that the credit ratings of teledyne’s debt will not be subject to a downgrade below investment grade if a ratings downgrade were to occur we could experience higher borrowing costs in the future and more restrictive debt covenants which would reduce profitability and diminish operational flexibility 

risks related to our business and industry 

acquisitions involve inherent risks that may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

our growth strategy includes acquisitions in 2021 and 2020 we expended 81 billion in cash and stock and 290 million in cash respectively relating to acquisitions and other investments acquisitions involve various inherent risks such as 

• our ability to assess accurately the value strengths weaknesses internal controls contingent and other liabilities and potential profitability of acquisition candidates 

• difficulties in integrating acquired businesses including the potential loss of key personnel from an acquired business our potential inability to achieve identified financial operating and other synergies anticipated to result from an acquisition and integration issues associated with internal controls of acquired businesses 

• the diversion of management’s attention from our existing businesses 

• the potential impairment of assets 

• potential unknown liabilities associated with a business that we acquire or in which we invest including environmental liabilities and 

• production delays associated with consolidating acquired facilities and manufacturing operations 

while we conduct financial and other due diligence in connection with our acquisitions and generally seek some form of protection such as indemnification from the seller insurance coverage and sometimes placing a portion of the purchase price in escrow to cover potential liabilities such acquired companies may have weaknesses or liabilities that are not accurately assessed or brought to our attention at the time of the acquisition further indemnities insurance or escrow arrangements may not fully cover such matters and acquisition of public companies such as our acquisition of flir typically do include post 

closing indemnities or escrows 

in connection with our acquisitions including those acquisitions that we do not complete we may incur significant transaction costs we are required to expense as incurred such transaction costs which may have a material adverse impact on our financial results 

we are experiencing component and raw material shortages due to worldwide supply chain constraints which impacts our ability to manufacture and ship all of the product for which we have demand 

our business is being impacted by interruptions in the supply chain due in part to the covid pandemic a resumption of strong worldwide demand for electronic products and components across a number of end markets and interruption in supplier and port operations as a result we are experiencing delays in delivery and shortages of certain components and raw materials needed for many of the products we manufacture particularly certain types of semiconductors silicon wafers specialized raw materials and chemicals adhesives engineered plastics and electronic components these conditions are currently limiting our ability to manufacture and ship all of the product for which we have demand in some cases we have had to commit to additional orders or longerterm contracts from suppliers to secure needed components and materials we expect these delays and shortages to continue in 2022 and that such shortages could result in delays in shipments to our customers during the period of such shortages any such delays would reduce our revenue and margins for the periods affected and would also result in an increase in our inventory of other components which would reduce our operating cash flow 

increased prices for components and raw materials used in our products and higher labor and shipping costs could adversely impact our profitability 

supply chain constraints and improving economic conditions have resulted in sustained increases in the prices we pay for many of the components and raw materials used in our products in addition we are experiencing higher labor costs due to increased competition for personnel in many regions in which we operate as well as general inflationary conditions and higher shipping costs due to labor and vehicle shortages and rising energy prices we expect inflationary pressures to persist in 2022 we may be unable to adjust our product pricing to reflect such higher costs if we are unable to increase our product prices enough to offset these increased costs our gross margins and profitability could decrease perhaps significantly over a sustained period of time 

our inability to attract and retain key personnel and labor shortages resulting from the covid pandemic and improving economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our future success 

our future success depends to a significant extent upon the continued service of our executive officers and other key management and technical personnel and on our ability to continue to attract retain and motivate qualified personnel the lack of human capital due to very competitive labor market conditions in certain regions could impact our ability to deliver products and services the skilled manufacturing and specialized engineering labor market is currently very competitive a significant portion of our revenue depends on the availability of a highly skilled technical workforce it is critical that we retain develop and grow our workforce to protect future revenue and improve our competitive advantage we are experiencing increased competition for our most talented employees which may erode our competitive advantage impair our ability to meet certain customer requirements or increase labor costs 

we have experienced and may continue to experience temporary labor shortages as a result of the covid pandemic due to personnel contracting the virus or needing to quarantine at home as a result of exposure to the virus as well as due to restrictive measures implemented by governments around the world to help control the spread of the virus including shelter in place or stay at home orders school closures orders that reduced the availability of public transportation and other measures governmentimposed vaccine mandates could negatively affect the availability of personnel or could lead to the attrition of personnel these impacts to our labor force resulting from the covid pandemic could materially affect our ability to manufacture ship or deliver our products and in certain instances may result in higher wage costs which could adversely impact our revenue and our results of operations 

we also have a mature workforce some of our businesses including our businesses in traveling wave tube and integrated microwave module design and development draw from a pool of specialized engineering talent that is small and currently shrinking some of our businesses have a need for employees with a certain level of security clearance and competition for such employees has increased while we have engaged in succession planning the loss of the services of one or more of our key employees or our failure to attract retain and motivate qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

escalating global trade tensions and the conflict between russia and ukraine and the adoption or expansion of tariffs and trade restrictions could negatively impact us 

china represented one of the top five countries for our international sales in 2021 and 2020 any tariffs or other trade restrictions affecting the import of products from china or any retaliatory trade measures taken by china in response to existing or future tariffs could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

starting in 2018 the us government imposed tariffs on a wide range of goods imported from china and china has retaliated by placing tariffs on various us origin goods while both countries signed a preliminary trade agreement in january 2020 halting further tariffs and increasing sales of us goods to china the agreement leaves in place most tariffs on chinese goods the final outcome of the negotiations and agreements is not possible to predict further escalation of the “trade war” between the us and china or the countries’ inability to reach further trade agreements could result in continued or increased tariffs high tariffs generally increase the cost of materials for our products which could result in our products becoming less competitive or generating lower margins with high tariffs imposed on our products we may also need to find new suppliers and components for our products which could result in production delays to the extent our products are the subject of retaliatory tariffs customers in some countries or regions such as china may begin to seek domestic or nonus sources for products that we sell or be pressured or incentivized by foreign governments not to purchase usorigin goods which could harm our future sales in these markets additionally china has bolstered laws or regulations requiring the use of local china suppliers and incountry manufacturing which has had a negative impact on teledyne’s revenues of instrumentation marine and digital imaging products as we currently have limited manufacturing operations in china 

additionally a number of wellestablished customers and suppliers have become listed on government restricted party lists without much warning in particular us export enforcement agencies have placed several chinese and russian companies and many of their international subsidiaries on such lists prohibiting the export to them of most commercial and dualuse items subject to the ear tariffs and trade restrictions could result in revenue reduction price increases on material used in our products or production delays which could adversely affect our business financial condition operational results and cash flows 

the conflict between russia and ukraine could lead to disruption instability and volatility in global markets and industries that could negatively impact our operations the us government and other governments in jurisdictions in which we operate have imposed severe sanctions and export controls against russia and russian interests and threatened additional sanctions and controls the impact of these measures as well as potential responses to them by russia is currently unknown and they could adversely affect our business supply chain partners or customers 

recession financial and credit market disruptions or an economic slowdown in china may adversely affect us 

if another global recession emerges or if economic growth in china slows we may experience declines in revenues profitability and cash flows from reduced orders payment delays collection difficulties increased price pressures for our products increased risk of excess and obsolete inventories or other factors caused by the economic problems of our customers our sales to chinabased customers represented approximately 56 and 60 of total revenues in 2021 and 2020 respectively economic growth in china had slowed due to the covid pandemic continued growth in many of our businesses including those in our environmental instrumentation group could be negatively impacted if another economic downturn occurs in china the covid pandemic has increased volatility and pricing in the capital markets if negative conditions in the global credit markets prevent our customers from having access to credit or render them insolvent orders for our products may decrease which would result in lower revenue likewise if our suppliers face challenges in obtaining credit in selling their products or otherwise in operating their businesses or remaining solvent they may become unable to offer the materials we use to manufacture our products an economic or credit crisis could also impact our ability to raise capital when needed these events could adversely impact our ability to manufacture affected products and could also result in reductions in our revenue increased price competition and increased operating costs which could adversely affect our business financial condition operational results and cash flows 

we develop and manufacture products for customers in the energy exploration and production markets domestic and international commercial aerospace markets the semiconductor industry and the consumer electronics telecommunications and automotive industries each of which has been cyclical exhibited rapid changes and suffered from fluctuating market demands a cyclical downturn in these markets may materially affect future operating results due to declines in air travel since the start of the covid pandemic we face risk that our addressable market for retrofit products will shrink further as airlines retire a significant number of aircraft 

in addition we sell products and services to customers in industries that are sensitive to the level of general economic activity and consumer spending habits and to customers in more mature industries that are sensitive to capacity constraints adverse economic conditions affecting these industries may reduce demand for our products and services which may reduce our revenues profits or production levels some of our businesses serve industries such as power generation and petrochemical refining which may be negatively impacted in the event of future reductions in global capital expenditures and manufacturing capacity or as a result of global environmental sustainability efforts 

we are subject to the risks associated with international sales and international operations and events in those countries could harm our business or results of operations 

during 2021 sales to customers outside the united states accounted for approximately 47 of our net sales compared with 45 in 2020 in 2021 we sold products to customers in over 100 countries in 2021 the top five countries for international sales were china the united kingdom germany japan and france constituting approximately 20 of our total sales we anticipate that future sales to international customers will continue to account for a significant and increasing percentage of our revenues particularly since business and growth plans for many teledyne businesses focus on sales outside of the united states to china and emerging markets such as india brazil and west africa 

risks associated with international sales and operations include but are not limited to 

• political and economic instability 

• international terrorism 

• export controls including us export controls related to china sanctions related to russia and increased scrutiny of exports of marine instruments digital imaging and other products 

• failure to comply with antibribery legislation including the us foreign corrupt practices act 

• changes in legal and regulatory requirements 

• us and foreign government policy changes affecting the markets for our products 

• changes in tax laws and tariffs 

• changes in us  china and us  russia relations 

• difficulties in protection and enforcement of intellectual property rights 

• failure to comply with the foreign data protection laws including the eu general data protection regulation “gdpr” in the european union and the personal information protection law in china 

• inadvertent transfers of exportcontrolled information due to increased crossborder technology transfers and the use of offshore computer servers 

• transportation including piracy in international waters 

• currency exchange rate fluctuations and 

• challenges relating to managing a global workforce with diverse cultures and backgrounds 

any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition currency exchange rate fluctuations may increase the cost of our products to international customers and therefore reduce our competitive position 

in june 2016 the uk held a referendum in which voters approved an exit from the european union “eu” commonly referred to as “brexit” the uk formally left the eu on january 31 2020 and entered a transition period until december 31 2020 during which the uk remained in both the eu customs union and single market that transition period has now ended and the eu and uk have entered into a trade and cooperation agreement “tca” the tca ensures tarifffree and quotafree trade in goods between the eu and the uk but also introduces certain nontariff barriers to trade in the medium to longterm the withdrawal of the uk from the eu may create further global economic uncertainty which may adversely impact the economies of the uk the eu countries and other nations may cause our current and future customers to reduce their spending on our products and services and may cause certain eubased customers to source products from businesses based outside of the uk potential brexitrelated risks for our ukbased businesses also include increased import duties loss of customers in the eu delays in the movement of goods between the uk and the eu and loss of access to the eu labor pool given our several ukbased businesses volatility in the value of the british pound relative to the us dollar or other foreign currencies could increase the cost of raw materials and components for our ukbased businesses and could otherwise adversely affect the business operations and the financial condition of our ukbased businesses 

we generate revenue from companies in the oil and gas industry especially the offshore oil and gas industry a historically cyclical industry with levels of activity that are significantly affected by the levels and volatility of oil and gas prices 

the oil and gas industry has historically been cyclical and characterized by significant changes in the levels of exploration and development activities oil and gas prices and market expectations of potential changes in those prices significantly affect the levels of those activities any prolonged reduction in the overall level of offshore oil and gas exploration and development activities whether resulting from changes in oil and gas prices or otherwise could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and the results of our businesses within our instrumentation segment 

some factors that have affected and are likely to continue affecting oil and gas prices and the level of demand for our products and services include the following 

• worldwide demand for oil and gas 

• general economic and business conditions and industry trends 

• the ability of the organization of petroleum exporting countries “opec” to set and maintain production levels 

• the level of production by nonopec countries 

• the ability of oil and gas companies to generate or raise funds for capital expenditures 

• domestic and foreign tax policy 

• laws and governmental regulations that restrict exploration and development of oil and gas in various offshore jurisdictions 

• laws and governmental regulation that restrict the use of hydraulic fracturing 

• technological changes 

• the political environment of oilproducing regions 

• the price and availability of alternative fuels and 

• climate change regulations that provide incentives to conserve energy use electric vehicles or use alternative energy sources or that impose restrictions on the development and extraction of oil and gas 

teledyne manufactures seismic energy sources interconnects and data acquisition products that are used in offshore energy exploration when crude oil and natural gas prices are low the level of marine seismic exploration activity typically decreases potentially resulting in reduced demand for our products used in offshore energy exploration in addition a decline in the level of capital spending by oil and natural gas companies may result in a reduced rate of development of new energy reserves which could adversely affect demand for our products related to energy production and in certain instances result in the cancellation modification or rescheduling of existing orders and a reduction in customerfunded research and development related to next generation products 

higher tax rates may harm our results of operations and cash flow 

as teledyne expands globally increases in the united states of the taxation of foreign income and expenses may harm our results of operations and cash flow the relative amount of income we earn in other jurisdictions could reduce our net income and increase our cash payments additionally the us presidential administration proposed a higher us federal statutory corporate income tax rate of 28 compared to the current rate of 21 such increased income tax rate in the us or in other jurisdictions could also reduce our net income and increase our cash payments 

changes in future business conditions could cause business investments goodwill and other longlived assets to become impaired resulting in significant losses and writedowns that would reduce our operating income 

on january 2 2022 teledyne’s goodwill was 79867 million and net acquired intangible assets were 27416 million under current accounting guidance we are required to test annually both acquired goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment based upon a fair value approach rather than amortizing the value over time we have chosen to perform our annual impairment reviews of goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year we are also required to test goodwill for impairment between annual tests if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce our enterprise fair value below its book value these events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate including a significant sustained decline in an entity’s market value legal factors operating performance indicators competition sale or disposition of a significant portion of the business or other factors if the fair market value is less than the carrying value including goodwill we could be required to record an impairment charge the valuation of reporting units requires judgment in estimating future cash flows discount rates and estimated product life cycles in making these judgments we evaluate the financial health of the business including such factors as industry performance changes in technology and operating cash flows as we have grown through acquisitions the amount of goodwill and net acquired intangible assets is a significant portion of our total assets as a result the amount of any annual or interim impairment could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our reported financial results for the period in which the charge is taken we also may be required to record an earnings charge or incur unanticipated expenses if as a result of a change in strategy or other reason we were to determine the value of other assets had been impaired 

for additional discussion of business investments goodwill and other longlived assets see the discussion under “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of operations and financial condition” and note 3 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

our revenue from us government contracts depends on the continued availability of funding from the us government and accordingly we have the risk that funding for our existing contracts may be canceled or diverted to other uses or delayed or that funding for new programs will not be available 

we perform work on a number of contracts with the us department of defense and other agencies and departments of the us government including subcontracts with government prime contractors sales under contracts with the us government including sales under contracts with the us department of defense as prime contractor or subcontractor represented approximately 26 of our total net sales in both 2021 and 2020 performance under government contracts has inherent risks that could have a material effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

government contracts are conditioned upon the continuing availability of congressional appropriations and the failure of congress to appropriate funds for programs in which we participate could negatively affect our results of operations us government shutdowns have resulted in delays in anticipated contract awards and delayed payments of invoices for several of our businesses and any new shutdown could have similar or worse effects the failure by congress to approve future budgets on a timely basis could delay procurement of our products and services and cause us to lose future revenues any renewed emphasis on federal deficit and debt reduction could lead to a further decrease in overall defense spending budgetary concerns could result in future contracts being awarded more on price than on other competitive factors and smaller defense 

budgets could result in government insourcing of programs and more intense competition on programs that are not insourced which could result in lower revenues and profits 

also defense spending does not necessarily correlate to continued business for us because not all of the programs in which we participate or have current capabilities may be provided with continued funding changes in policy and budget priorities by the us presidential administration for various defense and nasa programs could impact our engineered systems aerospace and defense electronics and digital imaging segments our aerospace and defense electronics segment may be impacted by volume or price reductions in connection with the f35 joint strike fighter program to the extent they are imposed the timing of program cycles can affect our results of operations for a quarter or year and cancellations of significant programs such as the international space station “iss” moi the shallow water combat submersible “swcs” or us navy health and research would affect our results 

in 2021 and 2020 our largest contract with the us government was the moi contract which represented 10 and 15 of our total net sales respectively in june 2020 teledyne brown engineering inc was notified that nasa had awarded to another contractor the marshall operations systems services and integration “mossi” contract which represented a combination of the huntsville operations support center contract and the moi contract subsequently teledyne brown engineering inc filed a protest challenging such award which protest was sustained and which sustainment triggered the cancelation of the mossi request for proposal and requiring a new award solicitation to begin the moi contract continues through june 2022 with options to extend up through december 2022 nasa released the new acquisition solicitation the marshall operations systems services and integration ii in august 2021 notification of award is expected in the second half of 2022 there is no guarantee that teledyne will be awarded this new contract 

it is also not uncommon for the us department of defense to delay the timing of awards or change orders for major programs for six to twelve months these delays by the us government could impact our revenues delays in procurements awards and modifications to contracts have negatively impacted revenue in 2021 this trend is continuing in 2022 and may also impact future revenue uncertainty over budgets or priorities with the us presidential administration could result in further delays in funding and the timing of awards and changes in funded programs that could have a material impact on our revenues u s government operation under a continuing resolution could impact the business by preventing new programs from starting as planned and by limiting funding on existing programs a significant shift in us government priorities related to programs and acquisition strategies could have a material impact to our financial results 

further most of our us government contracts are subject to termination by the us government either at its convenience or upon the default of the contractor termination for convenience provisions provides only for the recovery of costs incurred or committed settlement expenses and profit on work completed prior to termination termination for default clauses imposes liability on the contractor for excess costs incurred by the us government in reprocuring undelivered items from another source we had no us government contracts terminated for convenience or default in 2021 or in 2020 

our us government contracting business is subject to government contracting regulations including increasingly complex regulations on cybersecurity and our failure to comply with such laws and regulations could harm our operating results and prospects 

our us government contracting businesses like other government contractors are subject to various audits reviews and investigations including private party “whistleblower” lawsuits relating to our compliance with applicable federal and state laws and regulations more routinely the us government may audit the costs we incur on our us government contracts including allocated indirect costs such audits could result in adjustments to our contract costs any costs found to be improperly allocated to a specific contract will not be reimbursed and such costs already reimbursed would need to be refunded we have recorded contract revenues based upon costs we expect to realize after final audit in a worst case scenario should a business or division be charged with wrongdoing or should the us government determine that the business or division is not a “presently responsible contractor” that business or division and conceivably our company as a whole could be temporarily suspended or in the event of a conviction could be debarred for up to three years from receiving new government contracts or governmentapproved subcontracts in addition we could expend substantial amounts defending against such charges and in damages fines and penalties if such charges were proven or were to result in negotiated settlements routine audits by us government agencies of teledyne’s various procurement and accounting systems have the potential to result in disapproval of the audited systems by the administrative contracting officer disapproval could significantly impact cash flow as up to 10 may be withheld from payments 

the department of defense as well as other us government contracting agencies have adopted rules and regulations requiring contractors to implement a set of cybersecurity measures to attain the safeguarding of contractor systems that process store or transmit certain information implementation and compliance with these cybersecurity requirements is complex and costly and could result in unforeseen expenses lower profitability and in the case of noncompliance penalties and damages all of which could have an adverse effect on our business the cybersecurity requirements also impact our supply base which could impact cost schedule and performance on programs if suppliers do not meet the requirements and therefore do not qualify to support the programs 

we may not have sufficient resources to fund all future research and development and capital expenditures or possible acquisitions 

in order to remain competitive we must make substantial investments in research and development of new or enhanced products and continuously upgrade our process technology and manufacturing capabilities our research and development efforts primarily involve engineering and design related to improving existing products and developing new products and technologies in the same or similar fields our teledyne scientific company subsidiary which serves as our primary research center has been actively promoting and funding joint research and development projects with other teledyne businesses including teledyne oil  gas teledyne defense electronics teledyne digital imaging and our test and measurement businesses the business of teledyne e2v for which the design and development of specialized technology for high performance systems and equipment is integral also requires substantial investments in research and development additionally some of our businesses have sought or are actively pursuing governmental support and funding for some of their research and development initiatives including funding in 2019 for dalsa’s semiconductor foundry in bromont quebec nonetheless we may be unable to fund all of our research and development and capital investment needs or possible strategic acquisitions of businesses or product lines our ability to raise additional capital will depend on a variety of factors some of which will not be within our control including the existence of bank and capital markets investor perceptions of us our businesses and the industries in which we operate and general economic conditions failure to successfully raise needed capital or generate cash flow on a timely or costeffective basis could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition in addition if we fail to accurately predict future customer needs and preferences or fail to produce viable technologies we may invest heavily in research and development of products that do not lead to significant revenue which would adversely affect our profitability 

limitations in customer funding for applied research and development and limitations in government support for research and development expenditures may reduce our ability to apply our ongoing investments in some market areas 

we may be unable to successfully introduce new and enhanced products in a timely and costeffective manner or increase our participation in new markets which could harm our profitability and prospects 

our operating results depend in part on our ability to introduce new and enhanced products on a timely basis we have major development activities at some of our businesses for which a failure to execute in a timely manner could negatively impact those businesses in order to improve our product development capabilities we purchased the research center that is now teledyne scientific company in 2006 and in 2011 we purchased dalsa to gain access to a wellequipped mems research and development center in 2013 we opened a 52000squarefoot technology development center in daytona beach florida primarily to serve the offshore oil and gas production and exploration industries we are currently upgrading infrastructure at teledyne e2v’s facility in chelmsford uk and have expanded teledyne dalsa’s mems foundry in bromont quebec as well as acquired a second mems foundry in edmonton alberta as part of the micralyne acquisition successful product development and introduction depend on numerous factors including our ability to anticipate customer and market requirements changes in technology and industry standards our ability to differentiate our product offerings from the product offerings of our competitors and market acceptance we may not be able to develop and introduce new or enhanced products in a timely and costeffective manner or to develop and introduce products that satisfy customer requirements 

we also have the risk that our defense businesses may not be able to replace revenue related to legacy platforms with products for new platform applications we face the risk that changes in systems architectures will obviate the need for our products for example electronically steered radar arrays do not need certain high voltage interconnects like mechanically steered radar arrays do and unmanned aircraft will not need ejection seat sequencers 

our new products also may not achieve market acceptance or correctly address new industry standards and technological changes we may also lose any technological advantage to competitors if we fail to develop new products in a timely manner 

additionally new products may trigger increased warranty costs as information on such products is augmented by actual usage accelerated entry of new products to meet heightened market demand and competitive pressures may cause additional warranty costs as development and testing time periods might be accelerated or condensed 

we intend to both adapt our existing technologies and develop new products to expand into new market segments we may be unsuccessful in accessing these and other new markets if our products do not meet our customers’ requirements as a result of changes in either technology and industry standards or because of actions taken by our competitors 

we may not be able to reduce the costs of our products to satisfy customers’ cost reduction mandates which could harm our sales or margins 

cost conscious customers may seek price reductions of our products while we continually work to reduce our manufacturing and other costs of our products without affecting product quality and reliability there is no assurance that we will be able to do so or to do so in a timely manner to satisfy the pricing pressures of our customers prices of raw materials and other components used in our products may be beyond our control depending on market conditions as a result customers may seek lower cost products from china or other developing countries where manufacturing costs are lower 

the airline industry is heavily regulated and if we fail to comply with applicable requirements our results of operations could suffer 

the federal aviation administration “faa” and equivalent regulatory agencies have increasingly focused on the need to assure that airline industry products are designed with sufficient cybersecurity controls to protect against unauthorized access or other unwanted compromise a failure to meet these evolving expectations could negatively impact sales into the industry and expose us to legal or contractual liability 

governmental agencies throughout the world including the faa prescribe standards and qualification requirements for aircraft components including virtually all commercial airline and general aviation products specific regulations vary from country to country although compliance with faa requirements generally satisfies regulatory requirements in other countries if any material authorization or approval qualifying us to supply our products is revoked or suspended then sale of the product would be prohibited by law which would have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

from time to time the faa or equivalent regulatory agencies in other countries propose new regulations or changes to existing regulations which often are more stringent than existing regulations if such proposals are adopted and enacted we may incur significant additional costs to achieve compliance which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

recent trends by china’s aviation authority to relax restrictions on airspace may be reversed and anticipated new regulations loosening airspace restrictions may not materialize which could impact sales prospects in china for our commercial aerospace businesses 

increasing competition could reduce the demand for our products and services 

each of our markets is highly competitive many of our competitors have and potential competitors could have greater name recognition a larger installed base of products more extensive engineering manufacturing marketing and distribution capabilities and greater financial technological and personnel resources new or existing competitors may also develop new technologies that could adversely affect the demand for our products and services we have been experiencing increased competition for some of our key products furthermore some of our patents have or are expiring which could open up further competition additionally some of our customers have been developing competing products or electing to vertically integrate and replace our products with their own for example airbus is providing a wireless product fomax which now competes directly with teledyne controls hardware and services furthermore boeing has announced a vertical integration program which includes avionics lastly some of our products face increasing competition from alternative technologies 

industry acquisition and consolidation trends particularly among aerospace and defense contractors have adversely impacted demand for our aerospace and defense related engineering services as large prime contractors elect to insource major acquisition programs and expand small business participation to meet us government contracting goals such consolidations can also cause delays in business as the newly consolidated organization undergoes integration 

lowcost competition from china and other developing countries could also result in decreased demand for our products increasing competition could reduce the volume of our sales or the prices we may charge which would negatively impact our revenues we are experiencing increasing competition in our digital imaging businesses from chinese manufacturers which offer lower cost products with increasingly advanced technical capabilities smaller defense budgets both in the united states and europe could result in additional competition for new and existing defense programs 

product liability claims product recalls and field service actions could have a material adverse effect on our reputation business results of operations and financial condition and we may have difficulty obtaining product liability and other insurance coverage 

as a manufacturer and distributor of a wide variety of products including monitoring instruments products used in offshore oil and gas production products used in transportation and commercial aviation and products used in medical devices including xray detectors our results of operations are susceptible to adverse publicity regarding the quality or safety of our products in part product liability claims challenging the safety of our products may result in a decline in sales for a product which could adversely affect our results of operations this could be the case even if the claims themselves are proven to be untrue or settled for immaterial amounts 

while we have general liability and other insurance policies concerning product liabilities and errors and omissions we have selfinsured retentions or deductibles under such policies with respect to a portion of these liabilities awarded damages could be more than our accruals we could incur losses above the aggregate annual policy limit as well we cannot ensure that for 2022 and in future years insurance carriers will be willing to renew coverage or provide new coverage for product liability 

product recalls can be expensive and tarnish our reputation and have a material adverse effect on the sales of our products we cannot assure that we will not have additional product liability claims or that we will not recall any products 

we have been joined among a number of defendants often over 100 in lawsuits alleging injury or death as a result of exposure to asbestos in addition because of the prominent “teledyne” name we may continue to be mistakenly joined in lawsuits involving a company or business that was not assumed by us as part of our 1999 spinoff to date we have not incurred material liabilities in connection with these lawsuits however our historical insurance coverage including that of our 

predecessors may not fully cover such claims and the defense of such matters coverage typically depends on the year of purported exposure and other factors nonetheless we intend to vigorously defend our position against these claims 

teledyne brown engineering inc and other teledyne companies manufacture components for customers in the nuclear power market including utilities and certain governmental entities certain liabilities associated with such products are covered by the priceanderson nuclear industries indemnity act and other statutory and common law defenses and we have received indemnities from some of our customers however there is no assurance we will not face product liability claims related to such products or that our exposure will not exceed the amounts for which we have liability coverage or protection 

our business and financial results could be adversely affected by conditions and other factors associated with our suppliers and subcontractors 

apart from the current shortages we are experiencing due to global supply chain constraints as discussed above some items we purchase for the manufacture of our products are purchased from limited or single sources of supply due to technical capability price and other factors for example teledyne digital imaging has an internal single source of supply for ccd semiconductor wafers used to assemble image sensors and an external single source of supply for cmos semiconductor wafers used to assemble xray panel products furthermore sole source supply is more common among our businesses that are heavily involved in research and development because there can be few suppliers in the world capable of producing the products or providing the services with the right highly specialized technology teledyne lecroy continues to outsource a portion of its research and development activities to thirdparty engineering firms in malaysia and india where it may be more difficult for us to enforce our intellectual property rights teledyne lecroy also uses an engineering firm located in ukraine that may be adversely impacted by the conflict between russian and ukraine which in turn may delay some product development efforts we have also outsourced from time to time the manufacturing of certain parts components subsystems and even finished products to single or limited sources including international sources disruption of these sources or supplierimposed rationing of scarce components could cause delays or reductions in shipments of our products or increases in our costs which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or operations international sources possess additional risks some of which are similar to those described above regarding international sales with any continuing disruption in the global economy and financial markets some of our suppliers may also continue to face issues gaining access to sufficient credit and materials to maintain their businesses which could reduce the availability of some components and to the extent such suppliers are single source suppliers could adversely affect our ability to continue to manufacture and sell our products some companies engage subcontractors to perform a portion of the services we provide to our customers to provide these services the subcontractor must be financially viable company with applicable laws regulations and contract terms nonperformance by a subcontractor could result in misalignment between subcontractor performance and our contractual obligations to our customers lastly our teledyne hirel business screens tests packages performs various services and resells products of a third party and faces the risk that such third party may end its relationship due to economic conditions and other factors 

we face risks related to sales through distributors and other third parties which could harm our business 

we sell a portion of our products through third parties such as distributors sales representatives valueadded resellers and oems collectively “distributors” using third parties for distribution exposes teledyne to many risks including concentration credit risk and legal risk because under certain circumstances we may be held responsible for the actions of those thirdparty sales channels we may rely on one or more key distributors for selling a product and the loss of these distributors could reduce our revenue distributors may face financial difficulties including bankruptcy which could harm our collection of accounts receivables and financial results violations of the foreign corrupt practices act “fcpa” or similar antibribery laws by distributors or other thirdparty intermediaries could have a material impact on our business competitors could also block our access to such parties failing to manage risks related to our use of third party sales channels may reduce sales increase expenses and weaken our competitive position and could result in sanctions against us 

failing to comply with increasing environmental regulations as well as the effects of potential environmental liabilities could have a material adverse financial effect on us 

we like other industry participants are subject to various federal state local and international environmental laws and regulations we may be subject to increasingly stringent environmental standards in the future particularly as ghg emissions and climate change regulations and initiatives increase future developments administrative actions or liabilities relating to environmental and climate change matters could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition environmental regulations on hydraulic fracturing and the use of seismic energy sources for offshore energy exploration could adversely affect some product lines of our instrumentation segment 

our manufacturing operations including former operations could expose us to material environmental liabilities additionally companies that we acquire may have environmental liabilities that might not be accurately assessed or brought to our attention at the time of the acquisition 

the us environmental protection agency “epa” has focused on ghgs maintaining ghgs threaten the public health and welfare of the american people the epa also maintains that ghg emissions from onroad vehicles contribute to that threat the epa’s endangerment finding covers emissions of six ghgs the epa’s continuing efforts to limit ghg emissions could adversely affect our us manufacturing operations increase prices for energy fuel and transportation require us to accommodate changes in parameters such as the way parts are manufactured and may in some cases require us to redesign certain of our products this or other federal or state regulations could lead to increased costs which we may not be able to 

recover from customers delays in product shipments and loss of market share to competitors for example teledyne battery products unit makes lead acid batteries in california and is subject to a variety of environmental regulations and inspections which have increased over time also some of our sites conduct electroplating metal finishing and other operations that utilize hazardous materials that are subject to similar regulations regulatory changes or failure by a business to meet applicable requirements could disrupt that business or force a closure or relocation of the business 

our products are subject to various regulations that prohibit or restrict the use of certain hazardous substances for example our products placed on the european market are subject to the registration evaluation authorization and restriction of chemicals and the restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment directives future hazardous substance restrictions or prohibitions may limit our ability to market some products in certain countries

we may not be able to sell or reconfigure businesses facilities or product lines that we determine no longer meet with our growth strategy or that should be consolidated 

consistent with our strategy to emphasize growth in our core markets we continually evaluate our businesses to ensure that they are aligned with our strategy and objectives over the years we have also consolidated some of our business units and facilities in some cases to respond to downturns in the defense or oil and gas industries among other reasons we may not be able to realize efficiencies and cost savings from our consolidation activities there is no assurance that our efforts will be successful if we do not successfully manage our current consolidation activities or any other similar activities that we may undertake in the future expected efficiencies and benefits might be delayed or not realized and our operations and business could be disrupted our ability to dispose of exit or reconfigure businesses that may no longer be aligned with our growth strategy will depend on many factors including the terms and conditions of any asset purchase and sale agreement or lease agreement as well as industry business and economic conditions we cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to sell nonstrategic businesses on terms that are acceptable to us or at all in addition if the sale of any nonstrategic business cannot be consummated or is not practical alternative courses of action including relocation of product lines or closure may not be available to us or may be more costly than anticipated 

risks related to climate change 

climate change may have a longterm impact on our business  

climate change may have an increasingly adverse impact on our business and those of our customers partners and suppliers while we seek to mitigate the risks associated with climate change on our operations there are inherent climaterelated risks globally as discussed under the risk factor below headed “natural and manmade disasters could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition” some of our manufacturing facilities are located in regions that may be impacted by severe weather events like hurricanes or ice storms or in areas prone to wildfires the frequency and severity of which may increase as a result of climate change these events could result in potential damage to our physical assets as well as disruptions in manufacturing activities some of our manufacturing facilities are in areas that may be at risk due to rising sea levels moreover some of our manufacturing facilities are in areas that could experience decreased access to water and reliable energy due to climate issues severe weather and wildfire events may impair the ability of our employees to work effectively climate change including the increasing frequency and intensity of extreme weather events its impact on our supply chain and critical infrastructure worldwide and its potential to increase political instability in regions where we our customers partners and our suppliers do business may disrupt our business and may cause us to experience higher employee attrition and higher costs to maintain or resume operations the effects of climate change also may impact our decisions to construct new facilities or maintain existing facilities in the areas most prone to physical risks which could similarly increase our operating and material costs we could also face indirect financial risks passed through the supply chain that could result in higher prices for our products and the resources needed to produce them 

we sell products to customers directly engaged in oil and gas exploration and production changes to regulations social practices and preferences energy generation and transportation technologies that may occur or be implemented to mitigate climate change could result in reduced demand for hydrocarbon products which could result in a reduction in sales to these customers 

regulations associated with climate change could adversely affect our business 

legislative and regulatory measures currently under consideration or being implemented by government authorities to address climate change could require reductions in our greenhouse gas or other emissions establish a carbon tax or increase fuel or energy taxes we have also voluntarily announced goals to reduce our ghg emissions by a target date these legal requirements in addition to emission reduction efforts that we voluntarily undertake are expected to result in increased capital expenditures and compliance costs and could result in higher costs required to operate and maintain our facilities procure raw materials and energy and may require us to acquire emission credits or carbon offsets these costs and restrictions could harm our business and results of operations by increasing our expenses or requiring us to alter our operations and product design activities the inconsistent international regional andor national requirements associated with climate change regulations also create economic and regulatory uncertainty 

investor sentiment towards climate change and sustainability could adversely affect our business and the market price for our common stock  

increased investor focus and activism related to climate change and sustainability may hinder our access to capital as investors may reconsider their capital investment as a result of their assessment of our sustainability practices we may face increasing pressure regarding our sustainability disclosures and practices additionally members of the investment community may screen companies such as ours for sustainability performance before investing in our stock if we are unable to meet the sustainability standards set by these investors or if we are unable meet ghg reduction targets we communicate to the public we may lose investors our stock price may be negatively impacted and our reputation may be negatively affected 

other risks we face 

natural and manmade disasters could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

several of our facilities as a result of their locations could be subject to a catastrophic loss caused by earthquakes hurricanes tornados floods ice storms or other natural disasters many of our production facilities and our headquarters are located in california and thus are in areas with above average seismic activity and may also be at risk of damage due to wildfire in november 2018 wildfires impacted areas near our headquarters and principal research and development center in thousand oaks california resulting in temporary disruptions and evacuations of employees who lived nearby local utilities may impose blackouts during high fire risk weather conditions which could result in disruptions to our businesses located in california including our headquarters in the event of a major earthquake tornado hurricane or catastrophic event such as fire power loss telecommunications failure vandalism cyberattack war terrorist attack or health epidemic including covid we may be unable to continue our operations and may endure system interruptions reputational harm delays in our application development lengthy interruptions in our production breaches of data security and loss of critical data all of which could harm our business results of operations and financial condition teledyne flir’s goleta facility which is a single source supplier of sensors used throughout the flir business is located near a runway of the santa barbara airport and could be severely damaged in the event of an airplane crash teledyne dalsa’s semiconductor facilities in quebec canada have been impacted by loss of electrical power caused by severe ice storms in addition we have manufacturing facilities in the southeastern united states and texas that have been threatened or struck by major hurricanes in 2017 our businesses located in houston texas were impacted by hurricane harvey and our business in florida was threatened by hurricanes irma and matthew our facilities in alabama florida nebraska tennessee and virginia have also been threatened by tornados if any of our california facilities including our california headquarters or teledyne flir’s manufacturing facility in goleta california were to experience a catastrophic earthquake or wildfire loss or if any of our alabama florida nebraska tennessee or texas facilities were to experience a catastrophic hurricane storm tornado or other natural disaster or if dalsa’s facilities in quebec experience longterm loss of electrical power such event could disrupt our operations delay production shipments and revenue and result in large expenses to repair or replace the facility or facilities in addition the insurance we maintain may be insufficient to cover our losses resulting from disasters cyberattacks or other business interruptions and any incidents may result in loss of or increased costs of such insurance in addition our existing disaster recovery and business continuity plans including those relating to our information technology systems may not be fully responsive to or minimize losses associated with catastrophic events 

disasters also have an indirect adverse impact on our business for example in 2018 a fire at a netherlandsbased facility of a key supplier of printed circuit boards resulted in delivery disruptions to the electronics industry including to businesses in our digital imaging segment 

we may not be able to enforce or protect our intellectual property rights or third parties may claim we infringe their intellectual rights each which may harm our ability to compete and thus harm our business 

our ability to enforce and protect our patents copyrights software licenses trade secrets knowhow and other intellectual property rights is subject to general litigation risks as well as uncertainty as to the enforceability of our intellectual property rights in various countries when we seek to enforce our rights we have found that various claims may be asserted against us including claims that our intellectual property right is invalid is otherwise not enforceable or is licensed to the party against whom we are asserting a claim in addition we may be the target of aggressive and opportunistic enforcement of patents by third parties if we are not ultimately successful in defending ourselves against these claims in litigation we may not be able to sell a product or family of products due to an injunction or we may have to pay damages that could in turn harm our results of operations our inability to enforce our intellectual property rights under these circumstances may harm our competitive position and our business 

our business and operations could suffer in the event of cybersecurity breaches 

attempts by malicious actors to gain unauthorized access to our information technology systems have become more sophisticated and are sometimes successful these attempts which might be related to industrial or foreign government espionage crime activism or other motivations include covertly introducing malware into our computers and computer networks performing reconnaissance impersonating authorized users extortion and stealing corrupting or restricting our access to data among other activities we have in the past experienced cyberattacks including some loss of confidentiality and some loss of availability although these attacks have not had material impact on our business our customers and suppliers have also experienced successful cyberattacks which in some cases resulted in payments by or to us being unlawfully diverted 

we continue to train our personnel and update our infrastructure security tools and processes to protect against security incidents including both external and internal threats and to prevent their occurrence company personnel and third parties have been tasked to prevent deter detect respond to and investigate such incidents however it is possible that we might not prevent or be aware of or be able to react to an incident or its magnitude and effects the theft corruption unauthorized use or publication of our intellectual property or confidential business information due to a cyberattack could harm our competitive position reduce the value of our investment in research and development and other strategic initiatives or otherwise adversely affect our business we are subject to us department of defense regulations applicable to certain types of data residing on or transiting through our information systems and these regulations have been and will continue to be incorporated into certain us department of defense contracts that we hold to the extent that any security breach results in inappropriate disclosure of confidential or controlled information of employees third parties or the us government or any of the deployed security controls are deemed insufficient we may incur liability or the loss of contracts or security clearances as a result we expect to continue to devote additional resources to the security of our information technology systems operating technology systems products and services more resources may be required in the defense arena to the extent the us government increases its cybersecurity mandates unauthorized access to or control of our products data devices or systems could impact the safety of our customers and other third parties which could result in legal claims against us security breaches also could result in a violation of applicable us and international privacy and other laws including gdpr health insurance portability and accountability act payment card industry data security standard and california consumer privacy act and subject us to private consumer or securities litigation and governmental investigations and proceedings any of which could result in our exposure to material civil or criminal liability the systemic cybersecurity risk environment is elevated in part by remote working driven by covid pandemic concerns particularly at our customer and supplier partner organizations 

provisions of our governing documents applicable law and our change in control severance agreements could make an acquisition of teledyne more difficult 

our restated certificate of incorporation our amended and restated bylaws and the general corporation law of the state of delaware contain several provisions such as our classified board that could make the acquisition of control of teledyne in a transaction not approved by our board more difficult we have also entered into change in control severance agreements with ten members of our current management which could have an antitakeover effect these provisions may prevent or discourage attempts to acquire our company 

our amended and restated bylaws “bylaws” designate the court of chancery of the state of delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain lawsuits between us and our stockholders which could limit our stockholders’ ability to obtain a judicial forum that it finds favorable for such lawsuits and make it more costly for our stockholders to bring such lawsuits which may have the effect of discouraging such lawsuits 

our bylaws provide that unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum the court of chancery of the state of delaware will be to the fullest extent permitted by law the sole and exclusive forum for any i derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf ii action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors officers employees or agents to us or our stockholders iii action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the general corporation law of the state of delaware restated certificate of incorporation or bylaws iv any action to interpret apply enforce or determine the validity of the restated certificate of incorporation or bylaws or v action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine our bylaws also provide that any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring or holding any interest in shares of our capital stock will be deemed to have notice of and consented to this forum selection provision 

however this forum selection provision is not intended to apply to any actions brought under the securities act of 1933 the securities act as amended or the exchange act section 27 of the exchange act creates exclusive federal jurisdiction over all suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the exchange act or the rules and regulations thereunder and section 22 of the securities act creates concurrent jurisdiction for federal and state courts over all suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the securities act or the rules and regulations thereunder accordingly the forum selection provision in our bylaws will not relieve us of our duties to comply with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder and our stockholders will not be deemed to have waived our compliance with these laws rules and regulations 

nevertheless this forum selection provision in our bylaws may limit a stockholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or any of our directors officers and other employees which may discourage lawsuits with respect to such claims although our stockholders will not be deemed to have waived our compliance with federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder in addition stockholders who do bring a claim in the court of chancery in the state of delaware could face additional litigation costs in pursuing any such claim particularly if they do not reside in or near delaware while we believe the risk of a court declining to enforce the forum selection provision contained in our bylaws is low if a court were to find the provision inapplicable to or unenforceable in respect of one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions which could harm our business operating results and financial condition 

risks related to our securities 

an investment in teledyne’s common stock and other securities involve risks many of which are beyond our control 

stock markets in general including the new york stock exchange on which our common stock is listed have experienced a high degree of price and volume fluctuations that are not necessarily related to operating performance of the listed companies in addition to general economic political and market conditions such volatility may be related to i changes from analysts’ expectations in revenues earnings and other financial results ii strategic actions by other competitors iii changes to budgets or policies of the us and other governments and iv other risks described in this report we cannot provide assurances as to our common stock price which during fiscal 2021 ranged from a low of 35001 to a high of 46540

teledyne technologies incorporated “teledyne” or the “company” provides enabling technologies for industrial growth markets that require advanced technology and high reliability these markets include factory automation and condition monitoring aerospace and defense air and water quality environmental monitoring electronics design and development medical imaging and pharmaceutical research oceanographic research and deepwater energy exploration and production following the 2021 acquisition of flir systems inc  “flir” we further evolved into a global sensing and decisionsupport technology company providing specialty sensors cameras instrumentation algorithms and software across the electromagnetic spectrum as well as unmanned systems in the subsea land and air domains we differentiate ourselves from many of our direct competitors by having a customer and companysponsored applied research center that augments our product development expertise we believe that technological capabilities and innovation and the ability to invest in the development of new and enhanced products are critical to obtaining and maintaining leadership in our markets and the industries in which we compete 

strategyoverview 

our strategy continues to emphasize growth in our core markets of digital imaging instrumentation aerospace and defense electronics and engineered systems our core markets are characterized by high barriers to entry and include specialized products and services not likely to be commoditized we intend to strengthen and expand our core businesses with targeted acquisitions and through product development we continue to focus on balanced and disciplined capital deployment among capital expenditures acquisitions and product development we aggressively pursue operational excellence to continually improve our margins and earnings by emphasizing cost containment and cost reductions in all aspects of our business at teledyne operational excellence includes the rapid integration of the businesses we acquire using complementary technology across our businesses and internal research and development we seek to create new products to grow our company and expand our addressable markets we continue to evaluate our businesses to ensure that they are aligned with our strategy 

in connection with this strategy on may 14 2021 teledyne completed the acquisition of flir our largest acquisition to date in addition to the acquisition of flir we made one acquisition in 2020 and three acquisitions in 2019 see the recent acquisitions section for additional information 

covid and other matters 

with regard to the covid pandemic our first priority remains the health and safety of our employees and their families our manufacturing sites are deemed essential businesses and remain operational since the beginning of the covid pandemic we have practiced social distancing enhanced cleaning protocols increased usage of personal protective equipment and other preventative measures although the covid pandemic continued to impact our business operations and practices we experienced limited disruptions in 2021 we expect to continue to take robust actions to help protect the health safety and wellbeing of our employees to support continued performance to support our suppliers and partners and to continue to serve our customers our goals have been and continue to be to lessen the potential adverse impacts both health and economic and to continue to position the company for longterm success like the communities in which we operate our actions have varied depending on the severity of the covid pandemic and applicable government requirements the needs of our employees the needs of our customers and the needs of our business contingency plans remain in place in the event of significant impacts from covid infection resurgences and we may take further actions as government authorities require or recommend or as we determine to be in the best interests of our employees customers partners and suppliers 

while no company is immune to global economic challenges teledynes business portfolio is wellbalanced across end markets and geographies and includes a high degree of businesses serving critical infrastructure sectors such as the defense industrial base water and wastewater and healthcare and public health however given the continuing dynamic nature of this situation we may not fully estimate the impacts of covid on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

we have experienced supply chain challenges including increased lead times as well as cost inflation for parts and components logistics and labor due to availability constraints and high demand we expect inflationary and supply chain constraint trends to continue in 2022 

as part of a continuing effort to reduce costs and improve operating performance as well as to respond to the impact of the covid pandemic beginning in 2020 we took actions to reduce headcount across various businesses reducing our exposure to weak end markets such as commercial aerospace we also exited certain facilities no longer needed in 2021 we took actions to integrate flir into our businesses resulting in higher severance and facility closure costs in the digital imaging segment at january 2 2022 an immaterial amount remains to be paid related to these actions 

the following pretax charges were incurred related to severance and facility consolidations in millions 



a 2019 includes the reversal of certain amounts recorded in 2018 no longer needed

financial condition liquidity and capital resources 

principal cash and capital requirements 

our principal cash and capital requirements are to fund working capital needs capital expenditures income tax payments and debt service requirements as well as acquisitions it is anticipated that operating cash flow together with available borrowings under the credit facility and the debt financing arrangement described below will be sufficient to meet these requirements to support acquisitions we may need to raise additional capital our liquidity is not dependent upon the use of offbalance sheet financial arrangements we have no offbalance sheet financing arrangements that incorporate the use of special purpose or unconsolidated entities 

credit facility senior notes and term loan 

at january 2 2022 we had 2819 million in outstanding letters of credit of this amount 2446 million was released in february 2022 

our credit facility senior notes and term loan agreement require the company to comply with various financial and operating covenants including maintaining certain consolidated leverage and interest coverage ratios as well as minimum net worth levels and limits on acquired debt at january 2 2022 the company was in compliance with these covenants and we had a significant amount of margin between required financial covenant ratios and our actual ratios currently we do not believe our ability to undertake additional debt financing if needed is reasonably likely to be materially impacted by debt restrictions under our credit agreements subject to our complying with required financial covenants listed in the table below 

financial covenant ratios and the actual ratios at january 2 2022 



a the consolidated leverage ratio is equal to net debtebitda as defined in our 115 billion credit agreement requirement changes to 45 to 1 for the second and third quarter of 2022 and to 40 to 1 for the fourth quarter of 2022 and 35 to 1 thereafter

unrecognized tax benefits of 4020 million and accrued interest and penalties on these tax matters of 1608 million are not included in the table above as discussed in note 10 of the notes to consolidated financial statements teledyne paid 2964 million in february 2022 for the swedish tax matter including accrued interest and penalties the remaining unrecognized tax benefits and accrued interest and penalties are not included in the table above because 529 million is offset by deferred tax assets and the remainder cannot be reasonably estimated to be settled in cash due to a lack of prior settlement history and offsetting credits 

at january 2 2022 we were not required and accordingly are not planning to make any cash contributions to the domestic qualified pension plans for 2022 our minimum funding requirements after 2021 as set forth by erisa are dependent on several factors as discussed under “accounting for pension plans” in the critical accounting policies section of this management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation estimates beyond 2022 have not been provided due to the significant uncertainty of these amounts which are subject to change until the company’s pension assumptions can be updated at the appropriate times in addition certain pension contributions are eligible for future recovery through the pricing of products and services to the us government under certain government contracts therefore future cash contributions are not necessarily indicative of the impact these contributions may have on our liquidity we also have payments due under our other postretirement benefit plans these plans are not required to be funded in advance but are pay as you go see further discussion in note 11 of the notes to consolidated financial statements teledyne intends to continue to monitor and manage its defined benefit pension plans obligation and may take additional actions to manage risk in the future 

operating activities

income taxes 

our income tax expense deferred tax assets and liabilities and reserves for unrecognized tax benefits reflect management’s best assessment of estimated current and future taxes to be paid we are subject to income taxes in both the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions significant judgments and estimates are required in determining the consolidated income tax expense 

we intend to reinvest indefinitely the earnings of our material foreign subsidiaries in our operations outside of the united states the cash that the company’s foreign subsidiaries hold for indefinite reinvestment is generally used to finance foreign operations and investments including foreign acquisitions we estimate that future domestic cash generation will be sufficient to meet future domestic cash requirements us federal and applicable state income taxes have been accrued for deemed repatriations at january 2 2022 the amount of undistributed foreign earnings was 6198 million for which we have not recorded a deferred tax liability of approximately 13 million for corporate income taxes which would be due if reinvested foreign earnings were repatriated should we decide to repatriate the foreign earnings we would need to adjust our income tax provision in the period we determined that we would no longer indefinitely reinvest the earnings outside the united states 

deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amount in the financial statements which will result in taxable or deductible amounts in the future in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets within the jurisdiction from which they arise we consider all available positive and negative evidence including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities projected future taxable income taxplanning strategies and results of recent operations in projecting future taxable income we begin with historical results adjusted for the results of discontinued operations and incorporate assumptions about the amount of future state federal and foreign pretax operating income adjusted for items that do not have tax consequences the assumptions about future taxable income require significant judgment and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses in evaluating the objective evidence that historical results provide we consider three years of cumulative operating income based on the company’s history of operating earnings expectations of future operating earnings and potential tax planning strategies management believes that it is possible that some portion of deferred taxes will not be realized as a future tax benefit and therefore has recorded a valuation allowance 

we file income tax returns in the united states federal jurisdiction and in various states and foreign jurisdictions the company has substantially concluded on all us federal income tax matters for all years through 2011 canadian income tax matters for all years through 2012 swedish income tax matters for all years through 2011 norwegian income tax matters for all years through 2016 belgian income tax matters for all years through 2018 french income tax matters for all years through 2018 and united kingdom income tax matters for all years through 2019 

costs and pricing 

inflation has been rising in the markets in which we operate current inventory costs the increasing costs of labor materials equipment and other costs are considered in establishing sales pricing policies the company emphasizes cost containment and cost reductions in all aspects of its business 

hedging activities and market risk disclosures 

teledyne transacts business in various foreign currencies and has international sales and expenses denominated in foreign currencies subjecting the company to foreign currency risk the company’s primary foreign currency risk objective is to protect the u s dollar value of future cash flows and minimize the volatility of reported earnings the company utilizes foreign currency forward contracts to reduce the volatility of cash flows primarily related to forecasted revenue and expenses denominated in canadian dollars for our canadian companies and in british pounds for our uk companies these contracts are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges the company has converted us dollar denominated variable rate and fixed 

rate debt obligations of a european subsidiary into euro fixed rate obligations using a receive float pay fixed cross currency swap and a receive fixed pay fixed cross currency swap these cross currency swaps are designated as cash flow hedges in addition the company has converted domestic us variable rate debt to fixed rate debt using a receive variable pay fixed interest rate swap the interest rate swap is also designated as a cash flow hedge 

the effectiveness of the cash flow hedge forward contracts the cross currency swap hedges and the interest rate swap cash flow hedge is assessed prospectively and retrospectively on a monthly basis using regression analysis as well as using other timing and probability criteria to receive hedge accounting treatment all hedging relationships are formally documented at the inception of the hedges and must be highly effective in offsetting changes to future cash flows on hedged transactions the effective portion of the cash flow hedge forward contracts’ gains or losses resulting from changes in the fair value of these hedges is initially reported net of tax as a component of accumulated other comprehensive incomeloss “aoci” in stockholders’ equity until the underlying hedged item is reflected in our consolidated statements of income at which time the effective amount in aoci is reclassified to revenue in our consolidated statements of income for the cross currency swap and interest rate cash flow hedges effective amounts are recorded in aoci and reclassified into interest expense in the consolidated statements of income in addition for the cross currency swaps an amount is reclassified from aoci to other income and expense each reporting period to offset the earnings impact of the remeasurement of the hedged liabilities net deferred losses recorded in aoci net of tax for forward contracts that will mature in the next 12 months total 07 million these losses are expected to be offset by anticipated gains in the value of the forecasted underlying hedged item amounts related to the cross currency swaps and interest rate swap expected to be reclassified from aoci into income in the coming 12 months total 28 million 

in the event that the underlying forecasted transactions do not occur or it becomes remote that they will occur within the defined hedge period the gains or losses on the related cash flow hedges will be reclassified from aoci to other income and expense during the current reporting period all forecasted transactions occurred and therefore there were no such gains or losses reclassified to other income and expense due to missed forecasts 

as of january 2 2022 teledyne had foreign currency forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges to buy canadian dollars and to sell us dollars totaling 1482 million these foreign currency forward contracts have maturities ranging from march 2022 to february 2023 teledyne had foreign currency forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges to buy british pounds and to sell us dollars totaling 189 million these foreign currency forward contracts have maturities ranging from march 2022 to february 2023 

the cross currency swaps have notional amounts of €1130 million and 1250 million and €1350 million and 1500 million and mature in march 2023 and october 2024 respectively the interest rate swap has a notional amount of 1250 million and matures in march 2023 

in addition the company utilizes foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate foreign exchange rate risk associated with foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities including intercompany receivables and payables as of january 2 2022 teledyne primarily had foreign currency contracts of this type in the following currency pairs in millions 

the above table includes nondesignated hedges derived from terms contained in triggered or previously designated cash flow hedges these contracts had a positive fair value of 16 million at january 2 2022 the gains and losses on these derivatives which are not designated as hedging instruments are intended to at a minimum partially offset the transaction gains and losses recognized in earnings 

all derivatives are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value as discussed below the accounting for gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value depends on the use of the derivative and whether it is designated and qualifies for hedge accounting teledyne does not use foreign currency forward contracts for speculative or trading purposes 

notwithstanding our efforts to mitigate portions of our foreign currency exchange rate risks there can be no assurance that our hedging activities will adequately protect us against the risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations a 

hypothetical 10 percent price change of the us dollar from its value at january 2 2022 would result in a decrease or increase in the fair value of our foreign currency forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges to buy canadian dollars and to sell us dollars by approximately 148 million a hypothetical 10 percent price change in the us dollar from its value at january 2 2022 would result in a decrease in the fair value of our foreign currency forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges to buy british pounds and to sell us dollars by approximately 19 million a hypothetical 10 percent price change in the us dollar from its value at january 2 2022 would result in a decrease or increase in the fair value of our eurous dollar cross currency swaps designated as cash flow hedges by approximately 287 million a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in us interest rates at january 3 2021 would result in an increase in the fair value of our us dollar interest rate swap designated as a cash flow hedge by approximately 14 million while a 100 basis point decrease would result in a decrease in its fair value of 08 million 

borrowings under our credit facility are at fixed rates that vary with the term and timing of each loan under the facility loans under the facility typically have terms of one two three or six months and the interest rate for each such loan is subject to change if the loan is continued or converted following the applicable maturity date interest rates are also subject to change based on our debt to earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization ratio as of january 2 2022 we had 1250 million outstanding under our 115 billion credit facility any borrowings under the company’s credit facility are based on a fluctuating market interest rate and consequently the fair value of any outstanding debt should not be affected materially by changes in market interest rates 

our primary exposure to market risk relates to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates we periodically evaluate these risks and have taken measures to mitigate these risks we own assets and operate facilities in countries that have been politically stable 

environmental 

we are subject to various federal state local and international environmental laws and regulations which require that we investigate and remediate the effects of the release or disposal of materials at sites associated with past and present operations these include sites at which teledyne has been identified as a potentially responsible party under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act commonly known as superfund and comparable state laws we are currently involved in the investigation and remediation of a number of sites reserves for environmental investigation and remediation totaled 63 million and 65 million as of january 2 2022 and january 3 2021 respectively as investigation and remediation of these sites proceed and new information is received the company will adjust accruals to reflect new information based on current information we do not believe that future environmental costs in excess of those already accrued will materially and adversely affect our financial condition or liquidity see also our environmental risk factor disclosure beginning on page 16 and notes 2 and 14 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

government contracts 

we perform work on a number of contracts with the us department of defense and other agencies and departments of the us government including subcontracts with government prime contractors sales under these contracts with the us government which included contracts with the us department of defense were approximately 26 of total net sales in both 2021 and 2020 and 24 of total net sales in 2019 for a summary of sales to the us government by segment see note 12 of the notes to consolidated financial statements sales to the us department of defense represented approximately 19 19 and 17 of total net sales for 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively 

performance under government contracts has certain inherent risks that could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business results of operations and financial condition government contracts are conditioned upon the continuing availability of congressional appropriations which usually are made available on a fiscal year basis even though contract performance may take more than one year see also our government contracts risks factor disclosure beginning on page 12 

for information on accounts receivable from the us government see note 5 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

estimates and reserves 

our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent liabilities on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including those related to product returns and replacements allowance for doubtful accounts inventories intangible assets income taxes warranty obligations pension and other postretirement benefits longterm contracts environmental workers’ compensation and general liability employee benefits and other contingencies and litigation we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances at the time the results of which form the basis for making our judgments actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions in some cases such differences may be material see also critical accounting policies and estimates 

the following table reflects significant reserves and valuation accounts which are estimates and based on judgments as described above at january 2 2022 and january 3 2021 

  a this table should be read in conjunction with the notes to consolidated financial statements 

b includes both longterm and shortterm reserves 

some of the company’s products are subject to standard warranties and the company provides for the estimated cost of product warranties we regularly assess the adequacy of our preexisting warranty liabilities and adjust amounts as necessary based on a review of historical warranty experience with respect to the applicable business or products as well as the length and actual terms of the warranties which are typically one year the product warranty reserve is included in current accrued liabilities and other longterm liabilities on the balance sheet 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with united states generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the notes to the financial statements some of those judgments can be subjective and complex and therefore actual results could differ materially from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions our critical accounting policies are those that are reflective of significant judgment complexity and uncertainty and may potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions we have identified the following as critical accounting policies revenue recognition accounting for business combinations goodwill and acquired intangible assets accounting for income taxes and accounting for pension plans for additional discussion of the application of these and other accounting policies see note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition 

prior to the acquisition of flir approximately 40 of our revenue was recognized over time with the remaining 60 of our revenue recognized at a point in time the majority of flir revenue is recognized at a point in time in future periods we expect approximately 30 of revenue to be recognized over time with the remaining 70 recognized at a point in time 

revenue recognized over time relates primarily to contracts to design develop andor manufacture highly engineered products used in both defense and commercial applications the transaction price in these arrangements may include estimated amounts of variable consideration including award fees incentive fees contract amounts not yet funded or other provisions that can either increase or decrease the transaction price we estimate variable consideration at the amount to which we expect to be entitled and we include estimated amounts in the transaction price to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the estimation uncertainty is resolved the estimation of this variable consideration and determination of whether to include estimated amounts in the transaction price are based largely on an assessment of our anticipated performance and all information historical current and forecasted that is reasonably available to us as control transfers continuously over time on these contracts revenue is recognized based on the extent of progress towards completion of the performance obligation the selection of the method to measure progress towards completion requires judgment and is based on the nature of the products or services to be provided we generally use the costtocost measure of progress as this measure best depicts the transfer of control to the customer which occurs as we incur costs on our contracts under the costtocost method the extent of progress towards completion is measured based on the ratio of costs incurred to date to the total estimated costs at completion of the performance obligation 

for over time contracts using costtocost we have an estimate at completion “eac” process in which management reviews the progress and execution of our performance obligations this eac process requires management judgment relative to assessing risks estimating contract revenue determining reasonably dependable cost estimates and making assumptions for schedule and technical issues since certain contracts extend over a longer period of time the impact of revisions in cost and revenue estimates during the progress of work may adjust the current period earnings through a cumulative catchup basis this method recognizes in the current period the cumulative effect of the changes on current and prior quarters additionally if the 

current contract estimate indicates a loss a provision is made for the total anticipated loss in the period that it becomes evident contract cost and revenue estimates for significant contracts are generally reviewed and reassessed quarterly 

we do not believe that any discrete event or adjustment to an individual contract within the aggregate changes in contract estimates for 2021 2020 or 2019 was material to the consolidated statements of income for such annual periods 

revenue recognized at a point in time relates primarily to the sale of standard or minimally customized products with control transferring to the customer generally upon the transfer of title see note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional revenue recognition disclosures 

business combinations goodwill and acquired intangible assets 

the results for all acquisitions are included in the company’s consolidated financial statements from the date of each respective acquisition business acquisitions are accounted for under the acquisition method by assigning the purchase price to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at their fair values and the excess of the purchase price over the amounts assigned is recorded as goodwill we determine the fair value of such assets and liabilities often in consultation with thirdparty valuation advisors acquired intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives adjustments to fair value assessments are recorded to goodwill over the purchase price allocation period 

goodwill and acquired intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized we review goodwill and acquired indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable the company also performs an annual impairment test in the fourth quarter of each year we test goodwill and acquired indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment between annual tests if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce our enterprise fair value below its book value these events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate including a significant sustained decline in an entity’s market value legal factors operating performance indicators competition sale or disposition of a significant portion of the business or other factors 

we may use either a qualitative or quantitative approach when testing a reporting unit’s goodwill for impairment for selected reporting units where we use the qualitative approach we perform a qualitative evaluation of events and circumstances impacting the reporting unit to determine the likelihood of goodwill impairment based on that qualitative evaluation if we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount no further evaluation is necessary otherwise we perform a quantitative impairment test we perform a quantitative test for each reporting unit at least once every three years 

for goodwill impairment testing using the quantitative approach we estimate the fair value of the selected reporting units primarily through the use of a discounted cash flow model based on our best estimate of amounts and timing of future revenues and cash flows and our most recent business and strategic plans and compares the estimated fair value to the carrying value of the reporting unit including goodwill the discounted cash flow model requires judgmental assumptions about projected revenue growth future operating margins discount rates and terminal values over a multiyear period there are inherent uncertainties related to these assumptions and management’s judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill impairment while we believe we have made reasonable estimates and assumptions to calculate the fair value of its reporting units it is possible a material change could occur if actual results are not consistent with management’s estimates and assumptions goodwill may be overstated and a charge would need to be taken against net earnings 

when using a quantitative approach changes in our projections used in the discounted cash flow model could affect the estimated fair value of certain of the company’s reporting units and could result in a goodwill impairment charge in a future period in order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations used in the quantitative goodwill impairment test the company will apply a hypothetical 10 decrease to the fair values of each reporting unit subject to a quantitative impairment test and compare those values to the reporting unit carrying values due to the many variables inherent in the estimation of a reporting unit’s fair value and the relative size of our recorded goodwill differences in assumptions may have a material effect on the results of our impairment analysis 

as of january 2 2022 the company had eleven reporting units for goodwill impairment testing a qualitative test was performed for all reporting units in the four quarter of 2021 excluding the flir reporting unit the carrying value of goodwill included in the company’s individual reporting units ranged from 204 million to 8850 million on the most recent quantitative test date while goodwill for the flir reporting unit is provisional during the measurement period the provisional acquired goodwill balance is 59055 million the company’s analysis in 2021 indicated that in all instances the fair value of the company’s reporting units exceeded their carrying values and consequently did not result in an impairment charge 

income taxes 

we make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits benefits and deductions and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes in addition uncertainty exists regarding tax positions taken in previously filed tax returns still under 

examination and positions expected to be taken in the current year and future returns which may impact income tax expense on a quarterly basis we provide for income taxes based upon an estimated annual effective tax rate which is dependent on the geographic composition of worldwide earnings tax regulations governing each region availability of tax credits and the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies although we believe our income tax expense is reasonable no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome will not be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions to the extent that the final tax outcome is different than the amounts recorded such differences will impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made an increase of 100 basis points in our nominal tax rate would have resulted in additional income tax provision for the fiscal year ended january 2 2022 of 53 million 

deferred tax assets and liabilities arise due to differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and tax carryforwards significant management judgment is required in determining whether deferred tax assets will be realized in full or in part when it is morelikelythannot that all or some portion of deferred tax assets may not be realized a valuation allowance must be established against the deferred tax assets in assessing the need for a valuation allowance we consider all available positive and negative evidence including past operating results estimates of future taxable income and the feasibility of tax planning strategies in the event that we change our determination as to the amount of deferred tax assets that can be realized we will adjust our valuation allowance with a corresponding impact to the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made 

the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations across domestic and foreign jurisdictions we establish reserves for uncertain tax positions when despite the belief that our tax positions are supportable there remains uncertainty in a tax position taken in our filed tax returns or planned to be taken in a future tax return or claim we follow a recognition and measurement approach considering the facts circumstances and information available at the reporting date judgment is exercised in determining the level of evidence necessary and appropriate to support its assessment using all available information the technical merits of a given tax position are derived from sources of authority in the tax law and their applicability to the facts and circumstances of the position in measuring the tax position we consider the amount and probabilities of the outcomes that could be realized upon settlement when it is morelikelythannot that a tax position will be sustained we record a liability for the anticipated tax and interest due upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority unrecognized tax benefits including accrued penalties and interest increased 5293 million from the prior year primarily related to the flir acquisition on may 14 2021 during the first quarter of 2022 we paid approximately 2964 million related to an acquired uncertain tax position refer to note 3 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional detail to the extent we prevail in matters for which reserves have been established or are required to pay amounts in excess of reserves there could be a significant impact on our consolidated financial position and annual results of operations 

for a description of the company’s tax accounting policies refer to note 2 and note 10 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

pension plans 

the company’s accounting for its defined benefit pension plans requires that amounts recognized in financial statements be determined on an actuarial basis rather than as contributions are made to the plan in consultation with our actuaries we determine the appropriate assumptions for use in determining the liability for future pension benefits net actuarial gains or losses are amortized to expense on a planbyplan basis when they exceed the accounting corridor the accounting corridor is a defined range within which amortization of net gains and losses is not required and is equal to 10 percent of the greater of the market related value of assets or benefit obligations gains or losses outside of the corridor are subject to amortization for our plan which covers mostly inactive participants gains and losses subject to amortization are amortized over the average participants future life expectancy which is approximately 17 years this plan represents the majority of the pension obligations for our other plan gains and losses subject to amortization are amortized over the average employee future service period which is approximately nine years significant assumptions used in determining the our pension income or expense are the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets participant mortality estimates expected rates of increase in future compensation levels employee turnover as well as the assumed discount rate on pension obligations 

differences in the discount rate and expected longterm rate of return on assets within the indicated range would have had the following impact on 2021 pension expense in millions

many factors could change the anticipated results including ongoing challenges and uncertainties posed by the covid pandemic for businesses and governments around the world including production supply contractual and other disruptions facility closures furloughs and travel restrictions the inability to achieve operating synergies with respect to the flir acquisition changes in relevant tax and other laws risks associated with indebtedness as well as our ability to reduce indebtedness and the timing thereof the impact of semiconductor and other supply chain shortages higher inflation including wage competition and higher shipping costs and labor shortages and competition for skilled personnel the inability to develop and market new competitive products inherent uncertainties involved in the estimates and judgments used in the preparation of financial statements and the providing of estimates of financial measures in accordance with us gaap and related standards operating results of flir being lower than anticipated disruptions in the global economy customer and supplier bankruptcies changes in demand for products sold to the defense electronics instrumentation digital imaging energy exploration and production commercial aviation semiconductor and communications markets funding continuation and award of government programs cuts to defense spending resulting from existing and future deficit reduction measures or changes to us and foreign government spending and budget priorities triggered by the covid pandemic impacts from the united kingdom’s exit from the european union uncertainties related to the policies of the us presidential administration the imposition and expansion of and responses to trade sanctions and tariffs the continuing review and resolution of flir’s export and tax matters escalating economic and diplomatic tension between china and the united states the ongoing conflict between russia and ukraine threats to the security of our confidential and proprietary information including cybersecurity threats natural and manmade disasters including those related to or intensified by climate change and our ability to achieve emission reduction targets and decrease our carbon footprint lower oil and natural gas prices as well as instability in the middle east or other oil producing regions and new regulations or restrictions relating to energy production including those implemented in response to climate change could further negatively affect our businesses that supply the oil and gas industry continued weakness in the commercial aerospace industry will negatively affect the markets of our commercial aviation businesses in addition financial market fluctuations affect the value of the company’s pension assets changes in the policies of us and foreign governments including economic sanctions could result over time in reductions or realignment in defense or other government spending and further changes in programs in which the company participates 

while teledyne’s growth strategy includes possible acquisitions we cannot provide any assurance as to when if or on what terms any acquisitions will be made acquisitions involve various inherent risks such as among others our ability to integrate acquired businesses retain key management and customers and achieve identified financial and operating synergies there are additional risks associated with acquiring owning and operating businesses outside of the united states including those arising from us and foreign government policy changes or actions and exchange rate fluctuations 

we continue to take action to assure compliance with the internal controls disclosure controls and other requirements of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 while we believe our control systems are effective there are inherent limitations in all control systems and misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and may not be detected 

additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in the forwardlooking statements is contained beginning on page 6 of this form 10k under the caption “risk factors cautionary statement as to forwardlooking statements” forwardlooking statements are generally accompanied by words such as “estimate” “project” “predict” “believes” or “expect” that convey the uncertainty of future events or outcomes we assume no obligation to publicly update or revise any forwardlooking statements whether as a result of new information or otherwise

sales to international customers accounted for approximately 45 of total sales in 2020 compared with 44 in 2019 in both 2020 and 2019 we sold products to customers in over 100 foreign countries approximately 90 of our sales to international customers during 2020 were made to customers in 22 foreign countries in 2020 the top five countries for sales to international customers ranked by sales volume were china the united kingdom germany japan and france and represented approximately 20 of our total net sales 

approximately 26 and 24 of our total net sales for 2020 and 2019 respectively were derived from contracts with agencies of and prime contractors to the us government information on our sales to the us government including direct sales as a prime contractor and indirect sales as a subcontractor is as follows in millions 



our principal us government customer is the us department of defense which totaled approximately 5784 million and 5455 million of our total net sales for 2020 and 2019 respectively in 2020 and 2019 our largest program with the us government was the mission operations and integration contract with the nasa marshall space flight center which represented 15 and 14 of our total net sales respectively 

as described in greater detail under item 1a risk factors of this form 10k there are risks associated with doing business with the us government in 2020 approximately 67 of our us government prime contracts and subcontracts were fixedprice type contracts compared to 64 in 2019 under these types of contracts we bear the inherent risk that actual performance cost may exceed the fixed contract price such contracts are typically not subject to renegotiation of profits if we fail to anticipate technical problems estimate costs accurately or control costs during performance additionally us government contracts are subject to termination by the us government at its convenience without identification of any default when contracts are terminated for convenience we recover costs incurred or committed settlement expenses and profit on work completed prior to termination we had no us government contracts terminated for convenience in 2020 compared with three in 2019 

many of our government contracts are awarded after a competitive bidding process in which we seek to emphasize our ability to provide superior products and technical solutions in addition to competitive pricing 

our total backlog of confirmed and funded orders was approximately 17002 million at january 3 2021 compared with 16993 million at december 29 2019 we expect to fulfill more than 77 of such backlog of confirmed orders during 2021 

raw materials and suppliers 

generally our businesses have experienced minimal fluctuations in the supply of raw materials but not without some price volatility while some of our businesses provide services for those businesses that sell hardware and product a portion of the value that we provide is labororiented such as design engineering assembly and test activities in manufacturing our products we use our own production capabilities and thirdparty suppliers and subcontractors including international sources some of the items we use for the manufacture of our products including certain components for particular marine navigation applications certain magnets and helix wire for our traveling wave tubes certain infrared detectors substrates and certain ceramics and molding compounds used in our sonar systems as well as certain scintillator materials used in the production of our xray detectors are purchased from limited or single sources including international sources due to technical capability price and other factors at times we have experienced difficulty in procuring raw materials components subassemblies and other supplies required in our manufacturing processes due to shortages and supplierimposed allocation of components we did not experience significant difficulty in obtaining raw materials andor other supplies during 2020 

marketing 

our sales and marketing approach varies by segment and by products within our segments a shared fundamental tenet is the commitment to work closely with our customers to understand their needs with an aim to secure preferred supplier and longerterm relationships given the technical nature of our products we conduct our domestic and international marketing 

activities through a direct internal sales force as well as thirdparty sales representatives and distributors both in the united 

states and in other countries 

competition 

because of the diversity of products sold and the number of markets we serve we encounter a wide variety of 

competitors none of which we believe offer the same product and service lines or serve all of the same markets as we do although we have certain advantages that we believe help us compete effectively in our markets each of our markets is highly competitive with regard to our defense businesses it is common in the defense industry for work on programs to be shared among several companies including competitors our businesses vigorously compete on quality product performance and reliability technical expertise price and service many of our competitors have and potential competitors could have greater name recognition a larger installed base of products more extensive engineering manufacturing marketing and distribution capabilities and greater financial technological and personnel resources than we do

 item 1a risk factors tableend

risk factors cautionary statement as to forwardlooking statements 

the following discussion sets forth the material risk factors that could affect teledyne’s financial condition and 

operations you should not consider any descriptions of these factors to be a complete set of all potential risks that could affect 

teledyne any of the risk factors discussed below could by itself or combined with other factors materially and adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition competitive position or reputation including materially increasing expenses or decreasing revenues which could result in material losses or a decrease in earnings 

risks related to the pending acquisition of flir 

on january 4 2021 we announced our proposed acquisition of flir in a cash and stock transaction valued at approximately 80 billion including net debt which would make the acquisition our largest to date flir designs develops manufactures markets and distributes technologies that enhance perception and awareness flir provides innovative sensing solutions through thermal imaging visiblelight imaging video analytics measurement and diagnostic and advanced threat detection systems flir offers a diversified portfolio that serves a number of applications in government and defense industrial and commercial markets flir headquartered in wilsonville oregon will be part of the digital imaging segment 

while many of the products made and markets served by flir are complementary to teledyne the acquisition of flir would expand the size of our digital imaging segment relative to our other segments continued innovation and research and development efforts will be required to maintain flir’s leadership position in imaging products there are numerous risk and uncertainties associated with the acquisition including 

• completion of the acquisition is subject to a number of conditions some of which are outside of our control and if any of these conditions are not satisfied or waived the acquisition will not be completed among these conditions are the approval by flir’s stockholders of the acquisition the approval by our stockholders of the issuance of teledyne stock in the acquisition and the receipt of certain regulatory approvals including the expiration or termination of any applicable waiting period and any extension thereof under the hsr act and under the antitrust laws of certain nonus jurisdictions 

• teledyne’s and flir’s existing business relationships with third parties may be disrupted due to uncertainty associated with the acquisition which could have an adverse effect on the results of operations cash flows and financial position of the combined company 

• failure to complete the acquisition could negatively impact our stock price and our future business and financial results 

• the merger agreement between teledyne and flir subjects us to restrictions on our activities such as certain equity issuances during the period while the acquisition is pending 

• after the acquisition as a result of the issuance of teledyne stock in the acquisition to the holders of flir stock teledyne stockholders will have lower ownership and voting interests in teledyne than they currently have and will exercise less influence over management 

• litigation challenging the acquisition may increase costs and prevent the acquisition from being completed within the expected timeframe or from being completed at all 

• both we and flir will incur significant transaction costs in connection with the acquisition 

• unplanned future events and conditions could reduce or delay the accretion to earnings that is currently projected by us in connection with the acquisition 

• pursuant to the merger agreement we may be required under certain circumstances related to the termination of the merger agreement to pay a termination fee to flir of 2500 million which if paid may materially and adversely affect our financial results 

• we intend to pay the cash portion of the consideration for the acquisition refinance certain existing indebtedness of us and flir and pay other fees and expenses required to be paid in connection with the acquisition from cash on hand and borrowings there can be no assurance that we will be able to secure the funds necessary to pay the cash portion of the merger consideration in connection with the acquisition and refinance certain existing indebtedness on acceptable terms in a timely manner or at all 

• the covid19 pandemic may delay or prevent the completion of the acquisition 

• after completion of the acquisition we may fail to realize the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the transaction which could adversely affect the value of our common stock 

• the future results of the combined company may be adversely impacted if we do not effectively manage our expanded operations following completion of the acquisition 

• both teledyne and flir may have difficulty retaining motivating and attracting executives and other employees in light of the pending acquisition including those experienced with postacquisition integration and failure to do so could seriously harm the combined company 

• the effects of the covid19 pandemic could adversely affect the business results of operations and financial condition of teledyne flir and the combined company following the completion of the acquisition 

• the market price of our common stock may decline as a result of the acquisition if among other things the combined company does not achieve the perceived benefits of the acquisition as rapidly or to the extent anticipated by financial or industry analysts or if the effect of the acquisition on the combined company’s financial results is not consistent with the expectations of financial or industry analysts 

risks related to the indebtedness expected to be incurred in connection with the flir acquisition 

the incurrence by us of substantial indebtedness in connection with the financing of the acquisition along with the planned assumption of flir’s existing senior notes may have an adverse impact on our liquidity limit our flexibility in responding to other business opportunities and increase our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions 

teledyne expects to incur a significant amount of indebtedness in connection with the financing of the flir acquisition which we expect will be funded using borrowings along with cash on hand we may also incur additional indebtedness through the planned assumption of flir’s existing senior notes the use of indebtedness to finance the acquisition will reduce our liquidity and could cause us to place more reliance on cash generated from operations to pay principal and interest on our debt thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow for working capital and capital expenditure 

needs or to pursue other potential strategic plans we expect that the agreements we will enter into with respect to the indebtedness we will incur to finance the acquisition or in connection with the planned assumption of flir’s existing senior notes will contain negative covenants that subject to certain exceptions will include limitations on indebtedness liens dispositions investments and mergers and other fundamental changes our ability to comply with these negative covenants can be affected by events beyond our control the indebtedness and these negative covenants will also have the effect among other things of limiting our ability to obtain additional financing if needed limiting our flexibility in the conduct of our business and making us more vulnerable to economic downturns and adverse competitive and industry conditions in addition a breach of the negative covenants could result in an event of default with respect to the indebtedness which if not cured or waived could result in the indebtedness becoming immediately due and payable and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or operating results 

following completion of the acquisition the credit rating of the combined company could be downgraded andor the combined company may fail to obtain an investment grade rating which may increase borrowing costs or could trigger an obligation to make an offer to purchase flir’s 500 million senior notes 

by reason of the debt incurred to finance the cash portion of the consideration for the acquisition the combined company will have a considerably higher level of indebtedness than we and flir currently have in the aggregate and there can be no assurance that the credit ratings of the existing flir debt will not be subject to a downgrade below investment grade if a ratings downgrade were to occur or if the combined company fails to obtain an investment grade rating the combined company could experience higher borrowing costs in the future and more restrictive debt covenants which would reduce profitability and diminish operational flexibility specifically in the event that flir’s existing senior notes are downgraded below investment grade as a result of the acquisition the terms of these notes will require the combined company to commence a change of control offer after the closing of the acquisition 

because of higher debt levels we may not be able to service our debt obligations in accordance with the terms contained in the agreements 

our ability to meet our expense and debt service obligations contained in the agreements we expect to enter into with respect to the indebtedness we will incur to finance the acquisition will depend on our available cash and its future performance which will be affected by financial business economic and other factors including potential changes in laws or regulations industry conditions industry supply and demand balance customer preferences the success of our products and pressure from competitors if we are unable to meet our debt service obligations after the acquisition or should we fail to comply with our financial and other negative covenants contained in the agreements governing our indebtedness we may be required to refinance all or part of our debt sell important strategic assets at unfavorable prices incur additional indebtedness or issue common stock or other equity securities we may not be able to at any given time refinance our debt sell assets incur additional indebtedness or issue equity securities on terms acceptable to us  in amounts sufficient to meet our needs if we are able to raise additional funds through the issuance of equity securities such issuance would also result in dilution to our stockholders our inability to service our obligations or refinance our debt could have a material and adverse effect on our business financial condition or operating results after the acquisition in addition our debt obligations may limit our ability to make required investments in capacity technology or other areas of our business which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or operating results 

risks related to our business and industry 

acquisitions involve inherent risks that may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

our growth strategy includes acquisitions in 2020 and 2019 we expended 290 million and 4840 million in cash respectively relating to acquisitions and other investments acquisitions involve various inherent risks such as 

• our ability to assess accurately the value strengths weaknesses internal controls contingent and other liabilities and potential profitability of acquisition candidates 

• difficulties in integrating acquired businesses including the potential loss of key personnel from an acquired business our potential inability to achieve identified financial operating and other synergies anticipated to result from an acquisition and integration issues associated with internal controls of acquired businesses 

• the diversion of management’s attention from our existing businesses 

• the potential impairment of assets 

• potential unknown liabilities associated with a business that we acquire or in which we invest including environmental liabilities and 

• production delays associated with consolidating acquired facilities and manufacturing operations 

while we conduct financial and other due diligence in connection with our acquisitions and generally seek some form of protection such as indemnification from the seller insurance coverage and sometimes placing a portion of the purchase price in escrow to cover potential liabilities such acquired companies may have weaknesses or liabilities that are not accurately assessed or brought to our attention at the time of the acquisition further indemnities insurance or escrow arrangements may not fully cover such matters 

in connection with our acquisitions including those acquisitions that we do not complete we may incur significant transaction costs we are required to expense as incurred such transaction costs which may have a material adverse impact on our financial results 

our indebtedness and any failure to comply with our covenants that apply to our indebtedness could materially and adversely affect our business 

as of january 3 2021 we had 7785 million total outstanding indebtedness including 1950 million in senior unsecured fixed rate notes 3053 million in euro denominated fixed rate notes 1500 million in term loans and 1250 million outstanding under our 7500 million floating rate credit facility our indebtedness or a failure to comply with our covenants that apply to our indebtedness could harm our business by among other things reducing the funds available to make acquisitions capital expenditures or reducing our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business or market conditions our indebtedness exposes us to interest rate risk since a portion of our debt obligations are at variable rates our indebtedness or a failure to comply with our covenants that apply to our indebtedness could also have a material adverse effect on our business by increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions or a downturn in our business general adverse economic and industry conditions or a downturn in our business could result in our inability to repay this indebtedness in a timely manner 

further the financial conduct authority the authority that regulates the london interbank offered rate or libor has announced that it intends to stop compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of libor after 2021 the alternative reference rates committee “arrc” has proposed that the secured overnight financing rate “sofr” is the rate that represents best practice as the alternative to usdlibor for use in debt instruments derivatives and other financial contracts that are currently indexed to usdlibor arrc has proposed a paced market transition plan to sofr from usdlibor and organizations are currently working on industry wide and company specific transition plans as it relates to derivatives debt and cash markets exposed to usdlibor it is unclear as to what the new method of calculating libor that may evolve and this new method could adversely affect the company’s interest rates on the company’s indebtedness the company is monitoring the arrc transition plan and is evaluating potential related risks as of january 3 2021 approximately 353 of the company’s longterm debt is variable and can be indexed to usdlibor our 7500 million credit facility includes a procedure to switch to libor alternative replacement rates in the future 

escalating global trade tensions and the adoption or expansion of tariffs and trade restrictions could negatively impact us   

the company has operations in china which represented one of the top five countries for our international sales in 2020 and 2019 any tariffs or other trade restrictions affecting the import of products from china or any retaliatory trade measures taken by china in response to existing or future tariffs could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

starting in 2018 the us government imposed tariffs on a wide range of goods imported from china and china has retaliated by placing tariffs on various us origin goods while both countries signed a preliminary trade agreement in january 2020 halting further tariffs and increasing sales of us goods to china the agreement leaves in place most tariffs on chinese goods the final outcome of the negotiations and agreements is not possible to predict further escalation of the “trade war” between the us and china or the countries’ inability to reach further trade agreements could result in continued or increased tariffs high tariffs generally increase the cost of materials for our products which could result in our products becoming less competitive or generating lower margins with high tariffs imposed on our products we may also need to find new suppliers and components for our products which could result in production delays to the extent our products are the subject of retaliatory tariffs customers in some countries or regions such as china may begin to seek domestic or nonus sources for products that we sell or be pressured or incentivized by foreign governments not to purchase usorigin goods which could harm our future sales in these markets additionally if china bolsters laws or regulations requiring the use of local china suppliers it could have a negative impact on teledyne’s revenues 

additionally a number of wellestablished customers and suppliers have become listed on government restricted party lists without much warning in particular us export enforcement agencies have placed several chinese and russian companies and many of their international subsidiaries on such lists prohibiting the export of most commercial and dualuse items subject to the export administration regulations multiple teledyne companies had large pending orders with some of those companies that had to be either cancelled or for which teledyne has submitted export license applications that have a low probability of approval for example huawei technologies co ltd “huawei” and its nonus affiliates have been added to the us department of commerce bureau of industry and security entity list huawei was a customer of our test and measurement business and pending export license applications have not yet been approved the us government has also made efforts to increase restrictions on some of the listed entities including proposals to expand us export jurisdiction over foreign made products containing certain usorigin materials in 2020 the us government applied restrictions to products sold to huawei where there was no us content in the products but certain equipment used to manufacture the products had us origins additionally we face the risk that airbus a customer to our commercial aerospace business will demonstrate a preference for nonus sources due to the complications and uncertainties of trade compliance while we will continue to work to mitigate the impact of tariffs and trade restrictions they could result in revenue reduction price increases on material 

used in our products or production delays which could adversely affect our business financial condition operational results and cash flows 

a material amount of our total revenues is derived from companies in the oil and gas industry especially the offshore oil and gas industry a historically cyclical industry with levels of activity that are significantly affected by the levels and volatility of oil and gas prices 

a material amount of our total revenues is derived from companies in or connected to oil and gas exploration development and production especially the offshore oil and gas industry the oil and gas industry has historically been cyclical and characterized by significant changes in the levels of exploration and development activities oil and gas prices and market expectations of potential changes in those prices significantly affect the levels of those activities any prolonged reduction in the overall level of offshore oil and gas exploration and development activities whether resulting from changes in oil and gas prices or otherwise could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and the results of our businesses within our instrumentation segment 

some factors that have affected and are likely to continue affecting oil and gas prices and the level of demand for our products and services include the following 

• worldwide demand for oil and gas 

• general economic and business conditions and industry trends 

• the ability of the organization of petroleum exporting countries “opec” to set and maintain production levels 

• the level of production by nonopec countries 

• the ability of oil and gas companies to generate or raise funds for capital expenditures 

• domestic and foreign tax policy 

• laws and governmental regulations that restrict exploration and development of oil and gas in various offshore jurisdictions 

• laws and governmental regulation that restrict the use of hydraulic fracturing 

• technological changes 

• the political environment of oilproducing regions 

• the price and availability of alternative fuels and 

• climate change regulations that provide incentives to conserve energy or use alternative energy sources 

teledyne manufactures seismic energy sources interconnects and data acquisition products that are used in offshore energy exploration when crude oil and natural gas prices are low the level of marine seismic exploration activity typically decreases potentially resulting in reduced demand for our products used in offshore energy exploration in addition a decline in the level of capital spending by oil and natural gas companies may result in a reduced rate of development of new energy reserves which could adversely affect demand for our products related to energy production and in certain instances result in the cancellation modification or rescheduling of existing orders and a reduction in customerfunded research and development related to next generation products 

recession financial and credit market disruptions or an economic downturn in china may adversely affect us 

if another global recession emerges if economic uncertainty in europe continues or worsens or if economic growth in china slows we may experience declines in revenues profitability and cash flows from reduced orders payment delays collection difficulties increased price pressures for our products increased risk of excess and obsolete inventories or other factors caused by the economic problems of our customers our sales to chinabased customers represented approximately 60 and 66 of total revenues in 2020 and 2019 respectively economic growth in china had slowed due to the covid19 pandemic continued growth in many of our businesses including those in our environmental instrumentation group could be negatively impacted if another economic downturn occurs in china the covid19 pandemic has increased volatility and pricing in the capital markets if negative conditions in the global credit markets prevent our customers from having access to credit or render them insolvent orders for our products may decrease which would result in lower revenue likewise if our suppliers face challenges in obtaining credit in selling their products or otherwise in operating their businesses or remaining solvent they may become unable to offer the materials we use to manufacture our products an economic or credit crisis could also impact our ability to raise capital when needed these events could adversely impact our ability to manufacture affected products and could also result in reductions in our revenue increased price competition and increased operating costs which could adversely affect our business financial condition operational results and cash flows 

we develop and manufacture products for customers in the energy exploration and production markets domestic and international commercial aerospace markets the semiconductor industry and the consumer electronics telecommunications and automotive industries each of which has been cyclical exhibited rapid changes and suffered from fluctuating market demands a cyclical downturn in these markets may materially affect future operating results due to declines in air travel we face risk that our addressable market for retrofit products will shrink further as airlines retire significant number of aircraft 

in addition we sell products and services to customers in industries that are sensitive to the level of general economic activity and consumer spending habits and to customers in more mature industries that are sensitive to capacity constraints adverse economic conditions affecting these industries may reduce demand for our products and services which may reduce our revenues profits or production levels some of our businesses serve industries such as power generation and petrochemical 

refining which may be negatively impacted in the event of future reductions in global capital expenditures and manufacturing capacity 

we are subject to the risks associated with international sales and international operations which could harm our business or results of operations 

during 2020 sales to international customers accounted for approximately 45 of our total revenues compared with 44 in 2019 in 2020 we sold products to customers in over 100 countries in 2020 the top five countries for international sales were china germany the united kingdom japan and france constituting approximately 20 of our total sales we anticipate that future sales to international customers will continue to account for a significant and increasing percentage of our revenues particularly since business and growth plans for many teledyne businesses focus on sales outside of the united states to emerging markets such as china india brazil and west africa 

risks associated with international sales and operations include but are not limited to 

• political and economic instability 

• international terrorism 

• export controls including us export controls related to china sanctions related to russia and increased scrutiny of exports of marine instruments digital imaging and other products 

• failure to comply with antibribery legislation including the us foreign corrupt practices act 

• changes in legal and regulatory requirements 

• us and foreign government policy changes affecting the markets for our products 

• changes in tax laws and tariffs 

• changes in us  china and us  russia relations 

• difficulties in protection and enforcement of intellectual property rights 

• failure to comply with the foreign data protection laws including the eu general data protection regulation “gdpr” in the european union 

• inadvertent transfers of exportcontrolled information due to increased crossborder technology transfers and the use of offshore computer servers 

• transportation including piracy in international waters 

• currency exchange rate fluctuations and 

• challenges relating to managing a global workforce with diverse cultures and backgrounds 

any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition exchange rate fluctuations may increase the cost of our products to international customers and therefore reduce our competitive position 

in june 2016 the united kingdom “uk” held a referendum in which voters approved an exit from the european union “eu” commonly referred to as “brexit” the uk formally left the eu on january 31 2020 and entered a transition period until december 31 2020 during which the uk remained in both the eu customs union and single market that transition period has now ended and the eu and uk have entered into a trade and cooperation agreement “tca” the tca ensures tarifffree and quotafree trade in goods between the eu and the uk but also introduces certain nontariff barriers to trade in the medium to longterm the withdrawal of the uk from the eu may create further global economic uncertainty which may adversely impact the economies of the uk the eu countries and other nations may cause our current and future customers to reduce their spending on our products and services and may cause certain eubased customers to source products from businesses based outside of the uk for example brexitrelated uncertainty could lead to a reconsideration by airbus as to future investment and spending in the uk which could reduce sales for our ukbased businesses that supply airbus potential brexitrelated risks for our ukbased businesses also include increased import duties loss of customers in the eu delays in the movement of goods between the uk and the eu and loss of access to the eu labor pool given our several ukbased businesses volatility in the value of the british pound relative to the us dollar or other foreign currencies could increase the cost of raw materials and components for our ukbased businesses and could otherwise adversely affect the business operations and the financial condition of our ukbased businesses 

higher tax rates may harm our results of operations and cash flow 

as teledyne expands globally increases in the united states of the taxation of foreign income and expenses may harm our results of operations and cash flow the relative amount of income we earn in other jurisdictions could reduce our net income and increase our cash payments additionally the new us presidential administration proposed a higher corporate tax rate of 28 compared to 21 such increased tax rate in the us or in other jurisdictions could also reduce our net income and increase our cash payments 

changes in future business conditions could cause business investments goodwill and other longlived assets to become impaired resulting in significant losses and writedowns that would reduce our operating income 

on january 3 2021 teledyne’s goodwill was 21500 million and net acquired intangible assets were 4097 million under current accounting guidance we are required to test annually both acquired goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment based upon a fair value approach rather than amortizing the value over time we have chosen to perform our annual impairment reviews of goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year we are also required to test goodwill for impairment between annual tests if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce our enterprise fair value below its book value these events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate including a significant sustained decline in an entity’s market value legal factors operating performance indicators competition sale or disposition of a significant portion of the business or other factors if the fair market value is less than the carrying value including goodwill we could be required to record an impairment charge the valuation of reporting units requires judgment in estimating future cash flows discount rates and estimated product life cycles in making these judgments we evaluate the financial health of the business including such factors as industry performance changes in technology and operating cash flows as we have grown through acquisitions the amount of goodwill and net acquired intangible assets is a significant portion of our total assets as a result the amount of any annual or interim impairment could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our reported financial results for the period in which the charge is taken we also may be required to record an earnings charge or incur unanticipated expenses if as a result of a change in strategy or other reason we were to determine the value of other assets had been impaired 

for additional discussion of business investments goodwill and other longlived assets see the discussion under “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of operations and financial condition” and note 3 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

our revenue from us government contracts depends on the continued availability of funding from the us government and accordingly we have the risk that funding for our existing contracts may be canceled or diverted to other uses or delayed or that funding for new programs will not be available 

we perform work on a number of contracts with the us department of defense and other agencies and departments of the us government including subcontracts with government prime contractors sales under contracts with the us government including sales under contracts with the us department of defense as prime contractor or subcontractor represented approximately 26 of our total revenue in 2020 compared with 24 in 2019 performance under government contracts has inherent risks that could have a material effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

government contracts are conditioned upon the continuing availability of congressional appropriations and the failure of congress to appropriate funds for programs in which we participate could negatively affect our results of operations us government shutdowns have resulted in delays in anticipated contract awards and delayed payments of invoices for several of our businesses and any new shutdown could have similar or worse effects the failure by congress to approve future budgets on a timely basis could delay procurement of our products and services and cause us to lose future revenues any renewed emphasis on federal deficit and debt reduction could lead to a further decrease in overall defense spending budgetary concerns could result in future contracts being awarded more on price than on other competitive factors and smaller defense budgets could result in government insourcing of programs and more intense competition on programs that are not insourced which could result in lower revenues and profits 

also defense spending does not necessarily correlate to continued business for us because not all of the programs in which we participate or have current capabilities may be provided with continued funding changes in policy and budget priorities by the new us presidential administration for various defense and national aeronautics and space administration “nasa” programs could impact our engineered systems aerospace and defense electronics and digital imaging segments our aerospace and defense electronics segment may be impacted by volume or price reductions in connection with the f35 joint strike fighter program to the extent they are imposed the timing of program cycles can affect our results of operations for a quarter or year and cancellations of significant programs such as the space launch system “sls” launch vehicle stage adapter “lvsa” international space station “iss” mission operations and integration “moi” or the shallow water combat submersible “swcs” would affect our results 

in 2020 and 2019 our largest contract with the us government was the moi contract which represented 15 and 14 of our total net sales respectively in june 2020 teledyne brown engineering inc was notified that nasa had awarded to another contractor the marshall operations systems services and integration “mossi” contract which represented a combination of the huntsville operations support center contract and the moi contract subsequently teledyne brown engineering inc filed a protest challenging such award which protest was sustained and which sustainment triggered the cancelation of the mossi request for proposal and requiring a new acquisition free of involvement of individuals with a conflict of interest to begin while the moi contract continues through september 2021 and nasa has several options to further extend it through march 2023 there is no guarantee it will be further extended nasa anticipates release of the new acquisition the marshall operations systems services and integration ii draft solicitation in april 2021 with the award expected in late 2022 there is no guarantee that teledyne brown engineering will be awarded this new contract 

it is also not uncommon for the us department of defense to delay the timing of awards or change orders for major programs for six to twelve months reductions and delays in research and development funding by the us government could impact our revenues uncertainty over budgets or priorities with the new us presidential administration could result in delays in funding and the timing of awards and changes in funded programs that could have a material impact on our revenues a significant shift in us government priorities related to programs and acquisition strategies could have a material impact to our financial results 

further most of our us government contracts are subject to termination by the us government either at its convenience or upon the default of the contractor termination for convenience provisions provides only for the recovery of costs incurred or committed settlement expenses and profit on work completed prior to termination termination for default clauses imposes liability on the contractor for excess costs incurred by the us government in reprocuring undelivered items from another source we had no us government contracts terminated for convenience in 2020 compared with three in 2019 no contracts were terminated for default during such twoyear period 

our us government contracting business is subject to government contracting regulations including increasingly complex regulations on cybersecurity and our failure to comply with such laws and regulations could harm our operating results and prospects 

our us government contracting businesses like other government contractors are subject to various audits reviews and investigations including private party “whistleblower” lawsuits relating to our compliance with applicable federal and state laws and regulations more routinely the us government may audit the costs we incur on our us government contracts including allocated indirect costs such audits could result in adjustments to our contract costs any costs found to be improperly allocated to a specific contract will not be reimbursed and such costs already reimbursed would need to be refunded we have recorded contract revenues based upon costs we expect to realize after final audit in a worst case scenario should a business or division be charged with wrongdoing or should the us government determine that the business or division is not a “presently responsible contractor” that business or division and conceivably our company as a whole could be temporarily suspended or in the event of a conviction could be debarred for up to three years from receiving new government contracts or governmentapproved subcontracts in addition we could expend substantial amounts defending against such charges and in damages fines and penalties if such charges were proven or were to result in negotiated settlements routine audits by us government agencies of teledyne’s various procurement and accounting systems have the potential to result in disapproval of the audited systems by the administrative contracting officer disapproval could significantly impact cash flow as up to 10 may be withheld from payments 

the department of defense as well as other us government contracting agencies have adopted rules and regulations requiring contractors to implement a set of cyber security measures to attain the safeguarding of contractor systems that process store or transmit certain information implementation and compliance with these cyber security requirements is complex and costly and could result in unforeseen expenses lower profitability and in the case of noncompliance penalties and damages all of which could have an adverse effect on our business the cyber security requirements also impact our supply base which could impact cost schedule and performance on programs if suppliers do not meet the requirements and therefore do not qualify to support the programs 

we may not have sufficient resources to fund all future research and development and capital expenditures or possible acquisitions 

in order to remain competitive we must make substantial investments in research and development of new or enhanced products and continuously upgrade our process technology and manufacturing capabilities our research and development efforts primarily involve engineering and design related to improving existing products and developing new products and technologies in the same or similar fields our teledyne scientific company subsidiary which serves as our primary research center has been actively promoting and funding joint research and development projects with other teledyne businesses including teledyne oil  gas teledyne defense electronics teledyne digital imaging and our test and measurement businesses the business of teledyne e2v for which the design and development of specialized technology for high performance systems and equipment is integral also requires substantial investments in research and development additionally some of our businesses have sought or are actively pursuing governmental support and funding for some of their research and development initiatives including funding in 2019 for dalsa’s semiconductor foundry in bromont quebec nonetheless we may be unable to fund all of our research and development and capital investment needs or possible strategic acquisitions of businesses or product lines our ability to raise additional capital will depend on a variety of factors some of which will not be within our control including the existence of bank and capital markets investor perceptions of us our businesses and the industries in which we operate and general economic conditions failure to successfully raise needed capital or generate cash flow on a timely or costeffective basis could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition in addition if we fail to accurately predict future customer needs and preferences or fail to produce viable technologies we may invest heavily in research and development of products that do not lead to significant revenue which would adversely affect our profitability 

limitations in customer funding for applied research and development and limitations in government support for research and development expenditures may reduce our ability to apply our ongoing investments in some market areas 

we may be unable to successfully introduce new and enhanced products in a timely and costeffective manner or increase our participation in new markets which could harm our profitability and prospects 

our operating results depend in part on our ability to introduce new and enhanced products on a timely basis we have major development activities at some of our businesses for which a failure to execute in a timely manner could negatively impact those businesses in order to improve our product development capabilities we purchased the research center that is now teledyne scientific company in 2006 and in 2011 we purchased dalsa to gain access to a wellequipped mems research and development center in 2013 we opened a 52000squarefoot technology development center in daytona beach florida primarily to serve the offshore oil and gas production and exploration industries we are currently upgrading infrastructure at teledyne e2v’s facility in chelmsford uk and have expanded teledyne dalsa’s mems foundry in bromont quebec as well as acquired a second mems foundry in edmonton alberta as part of the micralyne acquisition successful product development and introduction depend on numerous factors including our ability to anticipate customer and market requirements changes in technology and industry standards our ability to differentiate our product offerings from the product offerings of our competitors and market acceptance we may not be able to develop and introduce new or enhanced products in a timely and costeffective manner or to develop and introduce products that satisfy customer requirements 

we also have the risk that our defense businesses may not be able to replace revenue related to legacy platforms with products for new platform applications we face the risk that changes in systems architectures will obviate the need for our products for example electronically steered radar arrays do not need certain high voltage interconnects like mechanically steered radar arrays do and unmanned aircraft will not need ejection seat sequencers 

our new products also may not achieve market acceptance or correctly address new industry standards and technological changes we may also lose any technological advantage to competitors if we fail to develop new products in a timely manner 

additionally new products may trigger increased warranty costs as information on such products is augmented by actual usage accelerated entry of new products to meet heightened market demand and competitive pressures may cause additional warranty costs as development and testing time periods might be accelerated or condensed 

we intend to both adapt our existing technologies and develop new products to expand into new market segments we may be unsuccessful in accessing these and other new markets if our products do not meet our customers’ requirements as a result of changes in either technology and industry standards or because of actions taken by our competitors 

we may not be able to reduce the costs of our products to satisfy customers’ cost reduction mandates which could harm our sales or margins 

cost conscious customers may seek price reductions of our products while we continually work to reduce our manufacturing and other costs of our products without affecting product quality and reliability there is no assurance that we will be able to do so or to do so in a timely manner to satisfy the pricing pressures of our customers prices of raw materials and other components used in our products may be beyond our control depending on market conditions as a result customers may seek lower cost products from china or other developing countries where manufacturing costs are lower 

the airline industry is heavily regulated and if we fail to comply with applicable requirements our results of operations could suffer 

the federal aviation administration “faa” and equivalent regulatory agencies have increasingly focused on the need to assure that airline industry products are designed with sufficient cybersecurity controls to protect against unauthorized access or other unwanted compromise a failure to meet these evolving expectations could negatively impact sales into the industry and expose us to legal or contractual liability 

governmental agencies throughout the world including the faa prescribe standards and qualification requirements for aircraft components including virtually all commercial airline and general aviation products specific regulations vary from country to country although compliance with faa requirements generally satisfies regulatory requirements in other countries if any material authorization or approval qualifying us to supply our products is revoked or suspended then sale of the product would be prohibited by law which would have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

from time to time the faa or equivalent regulatory agencies in other countries propose new regulations or changes to existing regulations which often are more stringent than existing regulations if such proposals are adopted and enacted we may incur significant additional costs to achieve compliance which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations recent trends by china’s aviation authority to relax restrictions on airspace may be reversed and anticipated new regulations loosening airspace restrictions may not materialize which could impact sales prospects in china for our commercial aerospace businesses 

the faa and the us department of justice’s fraud section among other agencies and countries have been investigating two boeing 737 max 8 aircraft crashes that occurred in october 2018 and march 2019 which resulted in the groundings of such aircraft across the world subsequently boeing announced in december 2019 that it was temporarily suspending production of the 737 max starting in january 2020 while boeing has started to resume minimal production in may 2020 and governmental groundings have been lifted production is not expected to reach historic levels for the immediate future while resumption of some production of the 737 max has been factored into our business plans there is a risk that airlines and air travelers may respond negatively to the 737 max aircraft due to historic and continuing perceived safety concerns these factors may further negatively impact our teledyne controls’ business 

increasing competition could reduce the demand for our products and services 

each of our markets is highly competitive many of our competitors have and potential competitors could have greater name recognition a larger installed base of products more extensive engineering manufacturing marketing and distribution capabilities and greater financial technological and personnel resources new or existing competitors may also develop new technologies that could adversely affect the demand for our products and services we have been experiencing increased competition for some of our key products furthermore some of our patents have or are expiring which could open up further competition for example our us patent related to our wireless groundlink product expired in 2018 allowing several competitors to enter the market additionally some of our customers have been developing competing products or electing to vertically integrate and replace our products with their own for example airbus is providing a wireless product fomax which now competes directly with teledyne controls hardware and services furthermore boeing has announced a vertical integration program which includes avionics specifically boeing has expressed its intention to replace certain teledyne wireless products on both the 737 max and 787 aircraft with its own wireless products lastly some of our products face increasing competition from alternative technologies for example the lead acid batteries that teledyne battery products sells face competition from lithium ion batteries among other competing technologies the hydrogen generation systems that teledyne energy systems sells also face increasing competition from new entrants to the onsite electrolysis of water market 

industry acquisition and consolidation trends particularly among aerospace and defense contractors have adversely impacted demand for our aerospace and defense related engineering services as large prime contractors elect to insource major acquisition programs and expand small business participation to meet government contracting goals such consolidations can also cause delays in business as the newly consolidated organization undergoes integration 

lowcost competition from china and other developing countries could also result in decreased demand for our products increasing competition could reduce the volume of our sales or the prices we may charge which would negatively impact our revenues smaller defense budgets both in the united states and europe could result in additional competition for new and existing defense programs 

product liability claims product recalls and field service actions could have a material adverse effect on our reputation business results of operations and financial condition and we may have difficulty obtaining product liability and other insurance coverage 

as a manufacturer and distributor of a wide variety of products including monitoring instruments products used in offshore oil and gas production products used in transportation and commercial aviation and products used in medical devices including xray detectors our results of operations are susceptible to adverse publicity regarding the quality or safety of our products in part product liability claims challenging the safety of our products may result in a decline in sales for a product which could adversely affect our results of operations this could be the case even if the claims themselves are proven to be untrue or settled for immaterial amounts 

while we have general liability and other insurance policies concerning product liabilities and errors and omissions we have selfinsured retentions or deductibles under such policies with respect to a portion of these liabilities awarded damages could be more than our accruals we could incur losses above the aggregate annual policy limit as well we cannot ensure that for 2021 and in future years insurance carriers will be willing to renew coverage or provide new coverage for product liability 

product recalls can be expensive and tarnish our reputation and have a material adverse effect on the sales of our products we cannot assure that we will not have additional product liability claims or that we will not recall any products 

we have been joined among a number of defendants often over 100 in lawsuits alleging injury or death as a result of exposure to asbestos in addition because of the prominent “teledyne” name we may continue to be mistakenly joined in lawsuits involving a company or business that was not assumed by us as part of our 1999 spinoff to date we have not incurred material liabilities in connection with these lawsuits however our historic insurance coverage including that of our predecessors may not fully cover such claims and the defense of such matters coverage typically depends on the year of purported exposure and other factors nonetheless we intend to vigorously defend our position against these claims 

teledyne brown engineering inc and other teledyne companies manufacture components for customers in the nuclear power market including utilities and certain governmental entities certain liabilities associated with such products are covered by the priceanderson nuclear industries indemnity act and other statutory and common law defenses and we have received indemnities from some of our customers however there is no assurance we will not face product liability claims related to such products or that our exposure will not exceed the amounts for which we have liability coverage or protection 

our business and financial results could be adversely affected by conditions and other factors associated with our suppliers and subcontractors 

some items we purchase for the manufacture of our products are purchased from limited or single sources of supply due to technical capability price and other factors for example teledyne digital imaging has an internal single source of supply for ccd semiconductor wafers used to assemble image sensors and an external single source of supply for cmos semiconductor wafers used to assemble xray panel products furthermore sole source supply is more common among our businesses that are heavily involved in research and development because there can be few suppliers in the world capable of producing the products or providing the services with the right highly specialized technology teledyne lecroy continues to outsource a portion of its research and development activities to thirdparty engineering firms in malaysia and india where it may be more difficult for us to enforce our intellectual property rights we have also outsourced from time to time the manufacturing of certain parts components subsystems and even finished products to single or limited sources including international sources disruption of these sources or supplierimposed rationing of scarce components could cause delays or reductions in shipments of our products or increases in our costs which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or operations we could experience global supply chain disruptions if the covid19 pandemic health crisis continues and new strains of the virus emerge international sources possess additional risks some of which are similar to those described above regarding international sales with any continuing disruption in the global economy and financial markets some of our suppliers may also continue to face issues gaining access to sufficient credit and materials to maintain their businesses which could reduce the availability of some components and to the extent such suppliers are single source suppliers could adversely affect our ability to continue to manufacture and sell our products some companies engage subcontractors to perform a portion of the services we provide to our customers to provide these services the subcontractor must be financially viable company with applicable laws regulations and contract terms nonperformance by a subcontractor could result in misalignment between subcontractor performance and our contractual obligations to our customers lastly our teledyne hirel business screens tests packages performs various services and resells products of a third party and faces the risk that such third party may end its relationship due to economic conditions and other factors 

we face risks related to sales through distributors and other third parties which could harm our business 

we sell a portion of our products through third parties such as distributors valueadded resellers and oems collectively “distributors” using third parties for distribution exposes teledyne to many risks including concentration credit risk and legal risk because under certain circumstances we may be held responsible for the actions of those thirdparty sales channels we may rely on one or more key distributors for a product and the loss of these distributors could reduce our revenue distributors may face financial difficulties including bankruptcy which could harm our collection of accounts receivables and financial results violations of the foreign corrupt practices act “fcpa” or similar antibribery laws by distributors or other thirdparty intermediaries could have a material impact on our business competitors could also block our access to key distributors failing to manage risks related to our use of distributors may reduce sales increase expenses and weaken our competitive position and could result in sanctions against us 

compliance with increasing environmental and climate change regulations as well as the effects of potential environmental liabilities could have a material adverse financial effect on us 

we like other industry participants are subject to various federal state local and international environmental laws and regulations we may be subject to increasingly stringent environmental standards in the future particularly as greenhouse gas emissions and climate change regulations and initiatives increase future developments administrative actions or liabilities relating to environmental and climate change matters could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition environmental regulations on hydraulic fracturing and the use of seismic energy sources for offshore energy exploration could adversely affect some product lines of our instrumentation segment 

our manufacturing operations including former operations could expose us to material environmental liabilities additionally companies that we acquire may have environmental liabilities that might not be accurately assessed or brought to our attention at the time of the acquisition 

the us environmental protection agency “epa” has focused on greenhouse gases “ghgs” maintaining ghgs threaten the public health and welfare of the american people the epa also maintains that ghg emissions from onroad vehicles contribute to that threat the epa’s endangerment finding covers emissions of six greenhouse gases the epa’s continuing efforts to limit ghg emissions could adversely affect our us manufacturing operations increase prices for energy fuel and transportation require us to accommodate changes in parameters such as the way parts are manufactured and may in some cases require us to redesign certain of our products this or other federal or state regulations could lead to increased costs which we may not be able to recover from customers delays in product shipments and loss of market share to competitors for example teledyne battery products unit makes lead acid batteries in california and is subject to a variety of environmental regulations and inspections which have increased over time also some of our sites conduct electroplating metal finishing and other operations that utilize hazardous materials that are subject to similar regulations regulatory changes or failure to meet applicable requirements could disrupt that business or force a closure or relocation of the business 

our products are subject to various regulations that prohibit or restrict the use of certain hazardous substances for example our products placed on the european market are subject to the registration evaluation authorization and restriction of chemicals “reach” and the restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment 

“rohs” directives future hazardous substance restrictions or prohibitions may limit our ability to market some products in certain countries 

for additional discussion of environmental matters see the discussion under the caption “other matters – environmental” of “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of results of operation and financial condition” and note 14 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our products that contribute to the environment sustainability and climate science see “item 1 business – environment and sustainability” 

our inability to attract and retain key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our future success 

our future success depends to a significant extent upon the continued service of our executive officers and other key management and technical personnel and on our ability to continue to attract retain and motivate qualified personnel we also have a maturing workforce some of our businesses including our businesses in traveling wave tube and integrated microwave module design and development draw from a pool of specialized engineering talent that is small and currently shrinking some of our businesses have a need for employees with a certain level of security clearance and competition for such employees has increased while we have engaged in succession planning the loss of the services of one or more of our key employees or our failure to attract retain and motivate qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we may not be able to sell or reconfigure businesses facilities or product lines that we determine no longer meet with our growth strategy or that should be consolidated 

consistent with our strategy to emphasize growth in our core markets we continually evaluate our businesses to ensure that they are aligned with our strategy and objectives over the years we have also consolidated some of our business units and facilities in some cases to respond to downturns in the defense or oil and gas industries among other reasons during 2020 we relocated our teledyne paradise datacom operation in state college pennsylvania to our teledyne microwave solutions facility in rancho cordova california we may not be able to realize efficiencies and cost savings from our consolidation activities there is no assurance that our efforts will be successful if we do not successfully manage our current consolidation activities or any other similar activities that we may undertake in the future expected efficiencies and benefits might be delayed or not realized and our operations and business could be disrupted our ability to dispose of exit or reconfigure businesses that may no longer be aligned with our growth strategy will depend on many factors including the terms and conditions of any asset purchase and sale agreement or lease agreement as well as industry business and economic conditions we cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to sell nonstrategic businesses on terms that are acceptable to us or at all in addition if the sale of any nonstrategic business cannot be consummated or is not practical alternative courses of action including relocation of product lines or closure may not be available to us or may be more costly than anticipated 

natural and manmade disasters could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

several of our facilities as a result of their locations could be subject to a catastrophic loss caused by earthquakes hurricanes tornados floods ice storms or other natural disasters many of our production facilities and our headquarters are located in california and thus are in areas with above average seismic activity and may also be at risk of damage due to wildfire in november 2018 wildfires impacted areas near our headquarters and principal research and development center in thousand oaks california resulting in temporary disruptions and evacuations of employees who lived nearby local utilities may impose blackouts during high fire risk weather conditions which could result in disruptions to our businesses located in california including our headquarters in the event of a major earthquake tornado hurricane or catastrophic event such as fire power loss telecommunications failure vandalism cyberattack war terrorist attack or health epidemic including covid19 we may be unable to continue our operations and may endure system interruptions reputational harm delays in our application development lengthy interruptions in our products breaches of data security and loss of critical data all of which could harm our business results of operations and financial condition teledyne dalsa’s semiconductor facilities in quebec canada have been impacted by loss of electrical power caused by severe ice storms in addition we have manufacturing facilities in the southeastern united states and texas that have been threatened or struck by major hurricanes in 2017 our businesses located in houston texas were impacted by hurricane harvey and our business in florida was threatened by hurricanes irma and matthew our facilities in alabama florida nebraska tennessee and virginia have also been threatened by tornados if any of our california facilities including our california headquarters were to experience a catastrophic earthquake or wildfire loss or if any of our alabama florida nebraska tennessee or texas facilities were to experience a catastrophic hurricane storm tornado or other natural disaster or if dalsa’s facilities in quebec experience longterm loss of electrical power such event could disrupt our operations delay production shipments and revenue and result in large expenses to repair or replace the facility or facilities in addition the insurance we maintain may be insufficient to cover our losses resulting from disasters cyberattacks or other business interruptions and any incidents may result in loss of or increased costs of such insurance in addition our existing disaster recovery and business continuity plans including those relating to our information technology systems may not be fully responsive to or minimize losses associated with catastrophic events 

disasters also have an indirect adverse impact on our business for example in 2018 a fire at a netherlandsbased facility of a key supplier of printed circuit boards resulted in delivery disruptions to the electronics industry including to businesses in our digital imaging segment 

teledyne brown engineering inc has developed built and launched a multiuser system for earth sensing that is affixed to the international space station “iss” for the program to continue to be financially successful the 21yearold iss must continue to fly in a safe and human tended condition while certain spaceflight risks such as a highvelocity debris impact to the station causing significant structural damage or necessitating the evacuation of the iss have been regarded as small if such event were to occur the iss program continuation could be threatened jeopardizing our investment and potential revenue generation from issbased earth imaging 

we may not be able to enforce or protect our intellectual property rights or third parties may claim we infringe their intellectual rights each which may harm our ability to compete and thus harm our business 

our ability to enforce and protect our patents copyrights software licenses trade secrets knowhow and other intellectual property rights is subject to general litigation risks as well as uncertainty as to the enforceability of our intellectual property rights in various countries when we seek to enforce our rights we have found that various claims may be asserted against us including claims that our intellectual property right is invalid is otherwise not enforceable or is licensed to the party against whom we are asserting a claim in addition we may be the target of aggressive and opportunistic enforcement of patents by third parties if we are not ultimately successful in defending ourselves against these claims in litigation we may not be able to sell a product or family of products due to an injunction or we may have to pay damages that could in turn harm our results of operations our inability to enforce our intellectual property rights under these circumstances may harm our competitive position and our business 

our business and operations could suffer in the event of cyber security breaches 

attempts by others to gain unauthorized access to our information technology systems have become more sophisticated and are sometimes successful these attempts which might be related to industrial or foreign government espionage crime activism or other motivations include covertly introducing malware into our computers and computer networks performing reconnaissance impersonating authorized users extortion and stealing corrupting or restricting our access to data among other activities we continue to train our personnel and update our infrastructure security tools and processes to protect against security incidents including both external and internal threats and to prevent their recurrence company personnel and third parties have been tasked to detect respond to and investigate such incidents but it is possible that we might not prevent or be aware of or be able to react to an incident or its magnitude and effects the theft corruption unauthorized use or publication of our intellectual property or confidential business information could harm our competitive position reduce the value of our investment in research and development and other strategic initiatives or otherwise adversely affect our business we are subject to us department of defense regulations applicable to certain types of data residing on or transiting through our information systems and these regulations have been and will continue to be incorporated into certain us department of defense contracts that we hold to the extent that any security breach results in inappropriate disclosure of confidential or controlled information of employees third parties or the us government or any of the deployed security controls are deemed insufficient we may incur liability or the loss of contracts or security clearances as a result we expect to continue to devote additional resources to the security of our information technology systems more resources may be required in the defense arena to the extent the us government increases its cyber security mandates unauthorized access to or control of our products devices or systems could impact the safety of our customers and other third parties which could result in legal claims against us security breaches also could result in a violation of applicable us and international privacy and other laws including gdpr health insurance portability and accountability act payment card industry data security standard and california consumer privacy act and subject us to private consumer or securities litigation and governmental investigations and proceedings any of which could result in our exposure to material civil or criminal liability lastly we are not immune from cyber security and privacy breaches of our customers and suppliers 

provisions of our governing documents applicable law and our change in control severance agreements could make an acquisition of teledyne more difficult 

our restated certificate of incorporation our amended and restated bylaws and the general corporation law of the state of delaware contain several provisions such as our classified board that could make the acquisition of control of teledyne in a transaction not approved by our board more difficult we have also entered into change in control severance agreements with ten members of our current management which could have an antitakeover effect these provisions may prevent or discourage attempts to acquire our company 

our amended and restated bylaws “bylaws” designate the court of chancery of the state of delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain lawsuits between us and our stockholders which could limit our stockholders’ ability to obtain a judicial forum that it finds favorable for such lawsuits and make it more costly for our stockholders to bring such lawsuits which may have the effect of discouraging such lawsuits 

our bylaws provide that unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum the court of chancery of the state of delaware will be to the fullest extent permitted by law the sole and exclusive forum for any i derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf ii action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors officers employees or agents to us or our stockholders iii action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the general corporation law of the state of delaware restated certificate of incorporation or bylaws iv any action to interpret apply enforce or determine the validity of the restated certificate of incorporation or bylaws or v action asserting a claim 

governed by the internal affairs doctrine our bylaws also provide that any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring or holding any interest in shares of our capital stock will be deemed to have notice of and consented to this forum selection provision 

however this forum selection provision is not intended to apply to any actions brought under the securities act of 1933 the securities act as amended or the exchange act section 27 of the exchange act creates exclusive federal jurisdiction over all suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the exchange act or the rules and regulations thereunder and section 22 of the securities act creates concurrent jurisdiction for federal and state courts over all suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the securities act or the rules and regulations thereunder accordingly the forum selection provision in our bylaws will not relieve us of our duties to comply with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder and our stockholders will not be deemed to have waived our compliance with these laws rules and regulations 

nevertheless this forum selection provision in our bylaws may limit a stockholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or any of our directors officers and other employees which may discourage lawsuits with respect to such claims although our stockholders will not be deemed to have waived our compliance with federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder in addition stockholders who do bring a claim in the court of chancery in the state of delaware could face additional litigation costs in pursuing any such claim particularly if they do not reside in or near delaware while we believe the risk of a court declining to enforce the forum selection provision contained in our bylaws is low if a court were to find the provision inapplicable to or unenforceable in respect of one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions which could harm our business operating results and financial condition 

risks related to our securities 

an investment in teledyne’s common stock and other securities involve risks many of which are beyond our control 

stock markets in general including the new york stock exchange on which our common stock is listed have experienced a high degree of price and volume fluctuations that are not necessarily related to operating performance of the listed companies in addition to general economic political and market conditions such volatility may be related to i changes from analysts’ expectations in revenues earnings and other financial results ii strategic actions by other competitors iii changes to budgets or policies of the us and other governments and iv other risks described in this report we cannot provide assurances as to our common stock price which during fiscal 2020 has ranged from a low of 19534 to a high of 39899

financial condition liquidity and capital resources 

principal cash and capital requirements 

our principal cash and capital requirements are to fund working capital needs capital expenditures income tax payments and debt service requirements as well as acquisitions it is anticipated that operating cash flow together with available borrowings under the credit facility and the debt financing arrangement described below will be sufficient to meet these requirements and to fund the flir acquisition to support acquisitions we may need to raise additional capital our liquidity is not dependent upon the use of offbalance sheet financial arrangements we have no offbalance sheet financing arrangements that incorporate the use of special purpose or unconsolidated entities 

as part of the pending acquisition of flir teledyne has arranged a 45 billion 364day credit commitment to support funding of the transaction teledyne expects to fund the acquisition with a combination of equity cash on hand and permanent debt financing including a combination of senior notes and bank term loans 

credit facility senior notes and term loan 



at january 3 2021 we had 277 million in outstanding letters of credit 

our credit facility senior notes and term loan agreement require the company to comply with various financial and operating covenants including maintaining certain consolidated leverage and interest coverage ratios as well as minimum net worth levels and limits on acquired debt at january 3 2021 the company was in compliance with these covenants and we had a significant amount of margin between required financial covenant ratios and our actual ratios currently we do not believe our ability to undertake additional debt financing if needed is reasonably likely to be materially impacted by debt restrictions under our credit agreements subject to our complying with required financial covenants listed in the table below 

financial covenant ratios and the actual ratios at january 3 2021 



a the consolidated leverage ratio is equal to net debtebitda as defined in our private placement note purchase agreement and our 7500 million credit agreement 

b the consolidated interest coverage ratio is equal to ebitdainterest as defined in our private placement note purchase agreement and our 7500 million credit agreement 

in the event of an acquisition our credit agreements permit us at our option to exceed the consolidated leverage ratio of 325 to 1 for up to four quarters following the fiscal quarter in which the acquisition event occurs provided that the consolidated leverage ratio does not exceed 35 to 1 

available borrowing capacity under the 7500 million credit facility which is reduced by borrowings and outstanding letters of credit was 6155 million at january 3 2021 see note 9  longterm debt to these consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our credit facility and term loan 

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our expected cash outflows resulting from financial contracts and commitments at january 3 2021 



  

a interest expense related to the credit facility including facility fees is assumed to accrue at the rates in effect at yearend 2020 and is assumed to be paid at the end of each quarter with the final payment in march 2024 when the credit facility expires 

b includes imputed interest and the shortterm portion of lease obligations 

c purchase obligations generally include contractual obligations for the purchase of goods and services and capital commitments that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specifies all significant terms including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased fixed minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the transaction 

unrecognized tax benefits of 323 million are not included in the table above because 147 million is offset by deferred tax assets and the remainder cannot be reasonably estimated to be settled in cash due to a lack of prior settlement history and offsetting credits 

at january 3 2021 we were not required and accordingly are not planning to make any cash contributions to the domestic qualified pension plans for 2021 our minimum funding requirements after 2020 as set forth by erisa are dependent on several factors as discussed under “accounting for pension plans” in the critical accounting policies section of this management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation estimates beyond 2021 have not been provided due to the significant uncertainty of these amounts which are subject to change until the company’s pension assumptions can be updated at the appropriate times in addition certain pension contributions are eligible for future recovery through the pricing of products and services to the us government under certain government contracts therefore future cash contributions are not necessarily indicative of the impact these contributions may have on our liquidity we also have payments due under our other postretirement benefit plans these plans are not required to be funded in advance but are pay as you go see further discussion in note 11 of the notes to consolidated financial statements teledyne intends to continue to monitor and manage its defined benefit pension plans obligation and may take additional actions to manage risk in the future 

operating activities 

in 2020 net cash provided by operating activities was 6189 million compared with 4821 million in 2019 and 4469 million in 2018 the higher cash provided by operating activities in 2020 compared with 2019 was driven by timing of accounts receivable collections cash flow from recent acquisitions and 356 million of lower income tax payments the higher cash provided by operating activities in 2019 compared with 2018 was driven by higher operating income partially offset by 454 million of higher income tax payments 

free cash flow cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures was 5475 million in 2020 compared with 3937 million in 2019 and 3601 million in 2018 



  

a we define free cash flow as cash provided by operating activities a measure prescribed by generally accepted accounting principles less capital expenditures for property plant and equipment we believe that this supplemental nongaap information is useful to assist management and the investment community in analyzing our ability to generate cash flow 

investing activities 

net cash used in investing activities was 994 million 5719 million and 886 million for 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively cash flows relating to investing activities consists primarily of cash used for acquisitions and other investments and capital expenditures 



during 2021 we plan to invest approximately 800 million in capital expenditures principally to upgrade facilities and manufacturing equipment 

acquisitions 

investing activities used cash for acquisitions and other investments of 290 million 4840 million and 31 million in 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively see “recent acquisitions” teledyne funded the acquisitions primarily from borrowings under its credit facilities issuance of senior notes and term loans and cash on hand on january 5 2020 we acquired oakgate technology inc for 285 million in cash 

for all acquisitions the results of operations and cash flows are included in our consolidated financial statements from the date of each respective acquisition 

the following table shows the purchase price net of cash acquired goodwill acquired and intangible assets acquired for the acquisitions and other investments made in 2020 and 2019 in millions 



goodwill resulting from the oakgate acquisition will not be deductible for tax purposes 



the majority of the goodwill resulting from the acquisition of the scientific imaging businesses will be deductible for tax purposes goodwill resulting from the acquisition of the gas and flame detection business and micralyne will not be deductible for tax purposes 

see note 15  subsequent events to these consolidated financial statements for information about the pending acquisition of flir 

financing activities

other matters 

pension plans 

effective january 1 2020 teledyne restructured its domestic qualified defined benefit pension plan the restructuring involved dividing our domestic qualified defined pension plan into two separate plans one comprised primarily of inactive participants the “inactive plan” and the other comprised primarily of active participants the “active plan” the reorganization was made to facilitate a targeted investment strategy over time and to provide additional flexibility in evaluating opportunities to reduce risk and volatility actuarial gains and losses associated with the active plan will continue to be amortized over the average remaining service period of the active participants which is approximately nine years while the actuarial gains and losses associated with the inactive plan will be amortized over the average remaining life expectancy of the inactive participants which is approximately 17 years these plans cover substantially all us employees hired before january 1 2004 or approximately 10 of teledyne’s active employees as of january 3 2021 as of january 1 2004 new us hires participate in a domestic defined contribution plan in 2020 2019 and 2018 teledyne was not required and did not make any cash contributions to the domestic pension plans for the company’s qualified defined benefit pension plans the discount rate for 2021 will decrease to an average of 264 from 341 in 2020 the company also has several small nonqualified domestic and foreignbased defined benefit pension plans 

income taxes 

our income tax expense deferred tax assets and liabilities and reserves for unrecognized tax benefits reflect management’s best assessment of estimated current and future taxes to be paid we are subject to income taxes in both the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions significant judgments and estimates are required in determining the consolidated income tax expense 

we intend to reinvest indefinitely the earnings of our material foreign subsidiaries in our operations outside of the united states the cash that the company’s foreign subsidiaries hold for indefinite reinvestment is generally used to finance foreign operations and investments including foreign acquisitions we estimate that future domestic cash generation will be sufficient to meet future domestic cash requirements due to the tax act us federal and applicable state income taxes have been accrued for the deemed repatriation at january 3 2021 the amount of undistributed foreign earnings was 3268 million for which we have not recorded a deferred tax liability of approximately 14 million for corporate income taxes which would be due if reinvested foreign earnings were repatriated should we decide to repatriate the foreign earnings we would need to adjust our income tax provision in the period we determined that we would no longer indefinitely reinvest the earnings outside the united states 

deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amount in the financial statements which will result in taxable or deductible amounts in the future in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets within the jurisdiction from which they arise we consider all available positive and negative evidence including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities projected future taxable income taxplanning strategies and results of recent operations in projecting future taxable income we begin with historical results adjusted for the results of discontinued operations and incorporate assumptions about the amount of future state federal and foreign pretax operating income adjusted for items that do not have tax consequences the assumptions about future taxable income require significant judgment and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses in evaluating the objective evidence that historical results provide we consider three years of cumulative operating income based on the company’s history of operating earnings expectations of future operating earnings and potential tax planning strategies management believes that it is possible that some portion of deferred taxes will not be realized as a future tax benefit and therefore has recorded a valuation allowance 

we file income tax returns in the united states federal jurisdiction and in various states and foreign jurisdictions the company has substantially concluded on all us federal income tax matters for all years through 2016 united kingdom income tax matters for all years through 2019 france income tax matters for all years through 2016 and canadian income tax matters for all years through 2012 

costs and pricing 

inflationary trends in recent years have been moderate current inventory costs the increasing costs of equipment and other costs are considered in establishing sales pricing policies the company emphasizes cost containment and cost reductions in all aspects of its business 

hedging activities and market risk disclosures 

teledyne transacts business in various foreign currencies and has international sales and expenses denominated in foreign currencies subjecting the company to foreign currency risk the company’s primary objective is to protect the united states dollar value of future cash flows and minimize the volatility of reported earnings the company utilizes foreign currency forward contracts to reduce the volatility of cash flows primarily related to forecasted revenue and expenses denominated in canadian dollars for our canadian companies and in british pounds for our uk companies these contracts are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges the company has converted us dollar denominated variable rate and fixed rate debt obligations of a european subsidiary into euro fixed rate obligations using a receive float pay fixed cross currency swap and a received fixed pay fixed cross currency swap these cross currency swaps are designated as cash flow hedges in addition the company has converted domestic us variable rate debt to fixed rate debt using a receive variable pay fixed interest rate swap the interest rate swap is also designated as a cash flow hedge 

the effectiveness of the cash flow hedge forward contracts the cross currency swap hedges and the interest rate swap cash flow hedge is assessed prospectively and retrospectively on a monthly basis using regression analysis as well as using other timing and probability criteria to receive hedge accounting treatment all hedging relationships are formally documented at the inception of the hedges and must be highly effective in offsetting changes to future cash flows on hedged transactions the effective portion of the cash flow hedge forward contracts’ gains or losses resulting from changes in the fair value of these hedges is initially reported net of tax as a component of accumulated other comprehensive incomeloss “aoci” in stockholders’ equity until the underlying hedged item is reflected in our consolidated statements of income at which time the effective amount in aoci is reclassified to revenue in our consolidated statements of income for the cross currency swap and interest rate cash flow hedges effective amounts are recorded in aoci and reclassified into interest expense in the consolidated statements of income in addition for the cross currency swaps an amount is reclassified from aoci to other income and expense each reporting period to offset the earnings impact of the remeasurement of the hedged liabilities net deferred gains recorded in aoci net of tax for forward contracts that will mature in the next 12 months total 54 million these gains are expected to be offset by anticipated losses in the value of the forecasted underlying hedged item amounts related to the cross currency swaps and interest rate swap expected to be reclassified from aoci into income in the coming 12 months total 12 million 

in the event that the underlying forecasted transactions do not occur or it becomes remote that they will occur within the defined hedge period the gains or losses on the related cash flow hedges will be reclassified from aoci to other income and expense during the current reporting period all forecasted transactions occurred and therefore there were no such gains or losses reclassified to other income and expense due to missed forecasts 

as of january 3 2021 teledyne had foreign currency forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges to buy canadian dollars and to sell us dollars totaling 1275 million these foreign currency forward contracts have maturities ranging from march 2020 to february 2021 

the cross currency swaps have notional amounts of €1130 million and 1250 million and €1350 million and 1500 million and mature in march 2023 and october 2024 respectively the interest rate swap has a notional amount of 1250 million and matures in march 2023 

in addition the company utilizes foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate foreign exchange rate risk associated with foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities including intercompany receivables and payables as of january 3 2021 teledyne primarily had foreign currency contracts of this type in the following currency pairs in millions 



these contracts had a positive fair value of 56 million at january 3 2021 the gains and losses on these derivatives which are not designated as hedging instruments are intended to at a minimum partially offset the transaction gains and losses recognized in earnings 

all derivatives are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value as discussed below the accounting for gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value depends on the use of the derivative and whether it is designated and qualifies for hedge accounting teledyne does not use foreign currency forward contracts for speculative or trading purposes 

notwithstanding our efforts to mitigate portions of our foreign currency exchange rate risks there can be no assurance that our hedging activities will adequately protect us against the risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations a hypothetical 10 percent price change of the us dollar from its value at january 3 2021 would result in a decrease or increase 

in the fair value of our foreign currency forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges to buy canadian dollars and to sell us dollars by approximately 127 million a hypothetical 10 percent price change in the us dollar from its value at january 3 2021 would result in a decrease or increase in the fair value of our eurous dollar cross currency swaps designated as cash flow hedges by approximately 313 million a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in us interest rates at january 3 2021 would result in an increase in the fair value of our us dollar interest rate swap designated as a cash flow hedge by approximately 26 million while a 100 basis point decrease would result in a decrease in its fair value of 05 million 

borrowings under our credit facility are at fixed rates that vary with the term and timing of each loan under the facility loans under the facility typically have terms of one two three or six months and the interest rate for each such loan is subject to change if the loan is continued or converted following the applicable maturity date interest rates are also subject to change based on our debt to earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization ratio as of january 3 2021 we had 1250 million outstanding under our 7500 million credit facility any borrowings under the company’s credit facility are based on a fluctuating market interest rate and consequently the fair value of any outstanding debt should not be affected materially by changes in market interest rates 

our primary exposure to market risk relates to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates we periodically evaluate these risks and have taken measures to mitigate these risks we own assets and operate facilities in countries that have been politically stable 

environmental 

we are subject to various federal state local and international environmental laws and regulations which require that we investigate and remediate the effects of the release or disposal of materials at sites associated with past and present operations these include sites at which teledyne has been identified as a potentially responsible party under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act commonly known as superfund and comparable state laws we are currently involved in the investigation and remediation of a number of sites reserves for environmental investigation and remediation totaled 65 million and 60 million as of january 3 2021 and december 29 2019 respectively as investigation and remediation of these sites proceed and new information is received the company will adjust accruals to reflect new information based on current information we do not believe that future environmental costs in excess of those already accrued will materially and adversely affect our financial condition or liquidity see also our environmental risk factor disclosure beginning on page 15 and notes 2 and 14 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

government contracts 

we perform work on a number of contracts with the us department of defense and other agencies and departments of the us government including subcontracts with government prime contractors sales under these contracts with the us government which included contracts with the us department of defense were approximately 26 of total net sales in 2020 24 of total net sales in 2019 and 23 of total sales in 2018 for a summary of sales to the us government by segment see note 12 of the notes to consolidated financial statements sales to the us department of defense represented approximately 19 17 and 17 of total net sales for 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively 

performance under government contracts has certain inherent risks that could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business results of operations and financial condition government contracts are conditioned upon the continuing availability of congressional appropriations which usually occurs on a fiscal year basis even though contract performance may take more than one year see also our government contracts risks factor disclosure beginning on page 11 

for information on accounts receivable from the us government see note 5 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

estimates and reserves 

our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent liabilities on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including those related to product returns and replacements allowance for doubtful accounts inventories intangible assets income taxes warranty obligations pension and other postretirement benefits longterm contracts environmental workers’ compensation and general liability employee benefits and other contingencies and litigation we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances at the time the results of which form the basis for making our judgments actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions in some cases such differences may be material see also critical accounting policies 

the following table reflects significant reserves and valuation accounts which are estimates and based on judgments as described above at january 3 2021 and december 29 2019 



  

a this table should be read in conjunction with the notes to consolidated financial statements 

b includes both longterm and shortterm reserves 

some of the company’s products are subject to standard warranties and the company provides for the estimated cost of product warranties we regularly assess the adequacy of our preexisting warranty liabilities and adjust amounts as necessary based on a review of historic warranty experience with respect to the applicable business or products as well as the length and actual terms of the warranties which are typically one year the product warranty reserve is included in current accrued liabilities and other longterm liabilities on the balance sheet 



critical accounting policies 

the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with united states generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the notes to the financial statements some of those judgments can be subjective and complex and therefore actual results could differ materially from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions our critical accounting policies are those that are reflective of significant judgment complexity and uncertainty and may potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions we have identified the following as critical accounting policies revenue recognition accounting for pension plans accounting for business combinations goodwill and acquired intangible assets and accounting for income taxes for additional discussion of the application of these and other accounting policies see note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition 

approximately 40 of our revenue is recognized over time with the remaining 60 of our revenue recognized at a point in time 

revenue recognized over time relates primarily to contracts to design develop andor manufacture highly engineered products used in both defense and commercial applications the transaction price in these arrangements may include estimated amounts of variable consideration including award fees incentive fees contract amounts not yet funded or other provisions that can either increase or decrease the transaction price we estimate variable consideration at the amount to which we expect to be entitled and we include estimated amounts in the transaction price to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the estimation uncertainty is resolved the estimation of this variable consideration and determination of whether to include estimated amounts in the transaction price are based largely on an assessment of our anticipated performance and all information historical current and forecasted that is reasonably available to us as control transfers continuously over time on these contracts revenue is recognized based on the extent of progress towards completion of the performance obligation the selection of the method to measure progress towards completion requires judgment and is based on the nature of the products or services to be provided we generally use the costtocost measure of progress as this measure best depicts the transfer of control to the customer which occurs as we incur costs on our contracts under the costtocost method the extent of progress towards completion is measured based on the ratio of costs incurred to date to the total estimated costs at completion of the performance obligation 

for over time contracts using costtocost we have an estimate at completion “eac” process in which management reviews the progress and execution of our performance obligations this eac process requires management judgment relative to assessing risks estimating contract revenue determining reasonably dependable cost estimates and making assumptions for schedule and technical issues since certain contracts extend over a longer period of time the impact of revisions in cost and revenue estimates during the progress of work may adjust the current period earnings through a cumulative catchup basis this method recognizes in the current period the cumulative effect of the changes on current and prior quarters additionally if the current contract estimate indicates a loss a provision is made for the total anticipated loss in the period that it becomes evident contract cost and revenue estimates for significant contracts are generally reviewed and reassessed quarterly 

we do not believe that any discrete event or adjustment to an individual contract within the aggregate changes in contract estimates for 2020 2019 or 2018 was material to the consolidated statements of income for such annual periods 

revenue recognized at a point in time relates primarily to the sale of standard or minimally customized products with control transferring to the customer generally upon the transfer of title see note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional revenue recognition disclosures 

pension plans 

the company’s accounting for its defined benefit pension plans requires that amounts recognized in financial statements be determined on an actuarial basis rather than as contributions are made to the plan in consultation with our actuaries we determine the appropriate assumptions for use in determining the liability for future pension benefits net actuarial gains or losses are amortized to expense on a planbyplan basis when they exceed the accounting corridor the accounting corridor is a defined range within which amortization of net gains and losses is not required and is equal to 10 percent of the greater of the market related value of assets or benefit obligations gains or losses outside of the corridor are subject to amortization for our plan which covers mostly inactive participants gains and losses subject to amortization are amortized over the average participants future life expectancy which is approximately 17 years this plan represents the majority of the pension obligations for our other plan gains and losses subject to amortization are amortized over the average employee future service period which is approximately nine years significant assumptions used in determining the company’s pension income or expense is the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets participant mortality estimates expected rates of increase in future compensation levels employee turnover as well as the assumed discount rate on pension obligations 

differences in the discount rate and expected longterm rate of return on assets within the indicated range would have had the following impact on 2020 pension expense in millions 



see note 11 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional pension disclosures 

business combinations goodwill and acquired intangible assets 

the results for all acquisitions are included in the company’s consolidated financial statements from the date of each respective acquisition business acquisitions are accounted for under the acquisition method by assigning the purchase price to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at their fair values and the excess of the purchase price over the amounts assigned is recorded as goodwill we determine the fair value of such assets and liabilities often in consultation with thirdparty valuation advisors acquired intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives adjustments to fair value assessments are recorded to goodwill over the purchase price allocation period 

goodwill and acquired intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized we review goodwill and acquired indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable the company also performs an annual impairment test in the fourth quarter of each year we test goodwill and acquired indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment between annual tests if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce our enterprise fair value below its book value these events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate including a significant sustained decline in an entity’s market value legal factors operating performance indicators competition sale or disposition of a significant portion of the business or other factors 

we may use either a qualitative or quantitative approach when testing a reporting unit’s goodwill for impairment for selected reporting units where we use the qualitative approach we perform a qualitative evaluation of events and circumstances impacting the reporting unit to determine the likelihood of goodwill impairment based on that qualitative evaluation if we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount no further evaluation is 

necessary otherwise we perform a quantitative impairment test we perform a quantitative test for each reporting unit at least once every three years 

for goodwill impairment testing using the quantitative approach the company estimates the fair value of the selected reporting units primarily through the use of a discounted cash flow model based on our best estimate of amounts and timing of future revenues and cash flows and our most recent business and strategic plans and compares the estimated fair value to the carrying value of the reporting unit including goodwill the discounted cash flow model requires judgmental assumptions about projected revenue growth future operating margins discount rates and terminal values over a multiyear period there are inherent uncertainties related to these assumptions and management’s judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill impairment while the company believes it has made reasonable estimates and assumptions to calculate the fair value of its reporting units it is possible a material change could occur if actual results are not consistent with management’s estimates and assumptions goodwill may be overstated and a charge would need to be taken against net earnings 

changes in our projections used in the discounted cash flow model could affect the estimated fair value of certain of the company’s reporting units and could result in a goodwill impairment charge in a future period in order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations used in the quantitative goodwill impairment test the company applied a hypothetical 10 decrease to the fair values of each reporting unit subject to a quantitative impairment test and compared those values to the reporting unit carrying values based on this sensitivity analysis the company did not identify any goodwill impairment due to the many variables inherent in the estimation of a reporting unit’s fair value and the relative size of our recorded goodwill differences in assumptions may have a material effect on the results of our impairment analysis 

as of january 3 2021 the company had nine reporting units for goodwill impairment testing the carrying value of goodwill included in the company’s individual reporting units ranged from 204 million to 8850 million on the quantitative test date the company’s analysis in 2020 indicated that in all instances the fair value of the company’s reporting units exceeded their carrying values and consequently did not result in an impairment charge the excess of the estimated fair value over the carrying value expressed as a percentage of carrying value of the respective reporting unit for the company’s reporting units subject to a quantitative test as of the fourth quarter of 2020 the annual testing date exceeded at least 116 

income taxes 

income tax expense and deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect management’s assessment of actual future taxes to be paid on items reflected in the financial statements significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes uncertainty exists regarding tax positions taken in previously filed tax returns still under examination and positions expected to be taken in the current year and future returns deferred tax assets and liabilities arise due to differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and tax carryforwards although we believe our income tax expense and deferred tax assets and liabilities are reasonable no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome will not be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals to the extent that the final tax outcome is different than the amounts recorded such differences will impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made the provision for income taxes includes the impact of uncertain tax benefits that are considered appropriate as well as the related net interest 

significant judgment is required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets in assessing the need for a valuation allowance we consider all available evidence including past operating results estimates of future taxable income and the feasibility of tax planning strategies in the event that we change our determination as to the amount of deferred tax assets that can be realized we will adjust our valuation allowance with a corresponding impact to the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made 

an increase of 100 basis points in our nominal tax rate would have resulted in additional income tax provision for the fiscal year ended january 3 2021 of 47 million for a description of the company’s tax accounting policies refer to note 2 and note 10 of the notes to consolidated financial statements

many factors could change the anticipated results including ongoing challenges and uncertainties posed by the covid19 pandemic for businesses and governments around the world the occurrence of any event change or other circumstances that could give rise to the right of teledyne or flir or both to terminate the merger agreement the outcome of any legal proceedings that may be instituted against teledyne or flir in connection with the merger agreement the failure to obtain necessary regulatory approvals and the risk that such approvals may result in the imposition of conditions that could adversely affect the combined company or the expected benefits of the transaction or stockholder approvals or to satisfy any of the other conditions to the proposed transaction on a timely basis or at all the failure to obtain the debt portion of the financing for the proposed transaction the inability to complete the acquisition and integration of flir successfully to retain customers and key employees and to achieve operating synergies including the possibility that the anticipated benefits of the proposed transaction are not realized when expected or at all including as a result of the impact of or problems arising from the integration of the two companies or as a result of the strength of the economy and competitive factors in the areas where teledyne and flir do business the possibility that the proposed transaction may be more expensive to complete than anticipated including as a result of unexpected factors or events the parties’ ability to meet expectations regarding the timing completion and accounting and tax treatments of the proposed transaction changes in relevant tax and other laws the inability to develop and market new competitive products inherent uncertainties involved in the estimates and judgments used in the preparation of financial statements and the providing of estimates of financial measures in accordance with us gaap and related standards operating results of flir being lower than anticipated disruptions in the global economy the spread of the covid19 virus resulting in production supply contractual and other disruptions including facility closures and furloughs and travel restrictions customer and supplier bankruptcies changes in demand for products sold to the defense electronics instrumentation digital imaging energy exploration and production commercial aviation semiconductor and communications markets funding continuation and award of government programs cuts to defense spending resulting from existing and future deficit reduction measures or changes to us and foreign government spending and budget priorities triggered by the covid19 pandemic impacts from the united kingdom’s exit from the european union uncertainties related to the policies of the new us presidential administration the imposition and expansion of and responses to trade sanctions and tariffs escalating economic and diplomatic tension between china and the united states and threats to the security of our confidential and proprietary information including cyber security threats lower oil and natural gas prices as well as instability in the middle east or other oil producing regions and new regulations or restrictions relating to energy production including with respect to hydraulic fracturing could further negatively affect our businesses that supply the oil and gas industry disruptions from the production delay of boeing’s 737 max aircraft and continued weakness in the commercial aerospace industry will negatively affect the markets of our commercial aviation businesses in addition financial market fluctuations affect the value of the companys pension assets 

changes in the policies of us and foreign governments including economic sanctions could result over time in reductions or realignment in defense or other government spending and further changes in programs in which the company participates 

while teledyne’s growth strategy includes possible acquisitions we cannot provide any assurance as to when if or on what terms any acquisitions will be made acquisitions involve various inherent risks such as among others our ability to integrate acquired businesses retain customers and achieve identified financial and operating synergies there are additional risks associated with acquiring owning and operating businesses outside of the united states including those arising from us and foreign government policy changes or actions and exchange rate fluctuations 

we continue to take action to assure compliance with the internal controls disclosure controls and other requirements of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 while we believe our control systems are effective there are inherent limitations in all control systems and misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and may not be detected

competition 

we believe that technological capabilities and innovation and the ability to invest in the development of new and enhanced products are critical to obtaining and maintaining leadership in our markets and the industries in which we compete although we have certain advantages that we believe help us compete effectively in our markets each of our markets is highly competitive with regard to our defense businesses it is common in the defense industry for work on programs to be shared among several companies including competitors in any event because of the diversity of products sold and the number of markets we serve we encounter a wide variety of competitors none of which we believe offer the same product and service lines or serve all of the same markets as we do our businesses vigorously compete on quality product performance and reliability technical expertise price and service many of our competitors have and potential competitors could have greater name recognition a larger installed base of products more extensive engineering manufacturing marketing and distribution capabilities and greater financial technological and personnel resources than we do 

intellectual property 

while we own and control various intellectual property rights including patents trade secrets confidential information trademarks trade names and copyrights which in the aggregate are of material importance to our business we believe that our business as a whole is not materially dependent upon any one intellectual property or related group of such properties we own several hundred active patents and are licensed to use certain patents technology and other intellectual property rights owned and controlled by others similarly other companies are licensed to use certain patents technology and other intellectual property rights owned and controlled by us

 item 1a risk factors tableend

risk factors cautionary statement as to forwardlooking statements 

the following text highlights various risks and uncertainties associated with teledyne these factors could materially affect “forwardlooking statements” within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 that we may make from time to time including forwardlooking statements contained in “item 1 business” and “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” of this form 10k and in teledyne’s 2019 annual report to stockholders it is not possible for management to predict all such factors and new factors may emerge or existing factors may change additionally management cannot assess the impact of each such factor on teledyne or the extent to which any factor or combination of factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forwardlooking statements 

escalating global trade tensions and the adoption or expansion of tariffs and trade restrictions could negatively impact us   

starting in 2018 the us government imposed tariffs on a wide range of goods imported from china and a trade war ensued between the two nations several countries affected by these tariffs imposed retaliatory tariffs in january 2020 under a uschina trade agreement china agreed to purchase 200 billion in additional goods and services from the united states over the next two years in exchange for the united states agreeing to reduce tariffs on 120 billion in chinese products from 15 to 75 it is not yet known what if any impact this deal may have on our businesses or what impact there may be if either party fails to live up to the terms of the deal more so with china given the coronavirus health crisis threatening its already slowing economic growth in any event high tariffs generally increase the cost of materials for our products which could result in our products becoming less competitive or generating lower margins with high tariffs imposed on our products we may also need to find new suppliers and components for our products which could result in production delays to the extent our products are the subject of retaliatory tariffs customers in some countries or regions such as china may begin to seek domestic or nonus sources for products that we sell or be pressured or incentivized by foreign governments not to purchase usorigin goods which could harm our future sales in these markets additionally if china were to enact laws or regulations requiring the use of local suppliers it could have a negative impact on teledyne’s revenues 

furthermore as global tensions increase more countries are enhancing their export regulations for example the uk has recently limited the sale of certain defense equipment to middle eastern countries we also have seen a recent increase in denial of export licenses for sales into russia turkey and the middle east 

additionally a number of wellestablished customers and suppliers have become listed on government restricted party lists without much warning in particular us export enforcement agencies have placed several chinese and russian companies and many of their international subsidiaries on such lists prohibiting the export of most commercial and dualuse items subject to the export administration regulations multiple teledyne companies had large pending orders with some of those companies that had to be either cancelled or for which teledyne submitted export license applications that have a low probability of approval for example huawei technologies co ltd “huawei” and its affiliates were added to the us department of commerce bureau of industry and security entity list on may 16 2019 huawei was a customer of our test and measurement business and pending license applications have not yet been approved the us government has also made efforts to increase restrictions on some of those listed entities including proposals to expand us export jurisdiction over certain foreign made products containing usorigin materials for example the us government had proposed modifying the minimum amount of us content permitted within products before they become subject to us export restrictions from 25 to 10 for anything sold to huawei while we will continue to work to mitigate the impact of tariffs and trade restrictions they could result in reduction in our revenue price increases on material used in our products or production delays which could adversely affect our business financial condition operational results and cash flows 

a material amount of our total revenues is derived from companies in the oil and gas industry especially the offshore oil and gas industry a historically cyclical industry with levels of activity that are significantly affected by the levels and volatility of oil and gas prices 

a material amount of our total revenues is derived from customers in or connected to oil and gas exploration development and production especially the offshore oil and gas industry the oil and gas industry has historically been cyclical and characterized by significant changes in the levels of exploration and development activities oil and gas prices and market expectations of potential changes in those prices significantly affect the levels of those activities any prolonged reduction in the overall level of offshore oil and gas exploration and development activities whether resulting from changes in oil and gas prices or otherwise could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and the results of our businesses within our instrumentation segment 

some factors that have affected and are likely to continue affecting oil and gas prices and the level of demand for our services and products include the following 

• worldwide demand for oil and gas 

• general economic and business conditions and industry trends 

• the ability of the organization of petroleum exporting countries or opec to set and maintain production levels 

• the level of production by nonopec countries 

• the ability of oil and gas companies to generate or raise funds for capital expenditures 

• domestic and foreign tax policy 

• laws and governmental regulations that restrict exploration and development of oil and gas in various offshore jurisdictions 

• laws and governmental regulation that restrict the use of hydraulic fracturing 

• technological changes 

• the political environment of oilproducing regions 

• the price and availability of alternative fuels and 

• climate change regulations that provide incentives to conserve energy or use alternative energy sources 

teledyne manufactures seismic energy sources interconnects and data acquisition products that are used in offshore energy exploration when crude oil and natural gas prices are low the level of marine seismic exploration activity typically decreases potentially resulting in reduced demand for our products used in offshore energy exploration in addition a decline in the level of capital spending by oil and natural gas companies may result in a reduced rate of development of new energy reserves which could adversely affect demand for our products related to energy production and in certain instances result in the cancellation modification or rescheduling of existing orders and a reduction in customerfunded research and development related to next generation products 

a new global recession or an economic downturn in china may adversely affect us 

if another global recession emerges if economic uncertainty in europe continues or worsens or if economic growth in china substantially slows we may experience declines in revenues profitability and cash flows from reduced orders payment delays collection difficulties increased price pressures for our products increased risk of excess and obsolete inventories or other factors caused by the economic problems of our customers our sales to chinabased customers represented 66 of total revenues in 2019 67 of total revenue in 2018 and 63 of total revenue in 2017 economic growth in china has moderated with a health crisis threatening already slowing economic growth continued growth in many of our businesses including those in our environmental and electronic measurement instrumentation group could be negatively impacted if an economic downturn persists in china if negative conditions in the global credit markets prevent our customers from having access to credit or render them insolvent orders for our products may decrease which would result in lower revenue likewise if our suppliers face challenges in obtaining credit in selling their products or otherwise in operating their businesses or remaining solvent they may become unable to offer the materials we use to manufacture our products these events could adversely impact our ability to manufacture affected products and could also result in reductions in our revenue increased price competition and increased operating costs which could adversely affect our business financial condition operational results and cash flows 

we develop and manufacture products for customers in the energy exploration and production markets domestic and international commercial aerospace markets the semiconductor industry and the consumer electronics telecommunications and automotive industries each of which has been cyclical exhibited rapid changes and suffered from fluctuating market demands a cyclical downturn in these markets may materially affect future operating results 

in addition we sell products and services to customers in industries that are sensitive to the level of general economic activity and consumer spending habits and to customers in more mature industries that are sensitive to capacity constraints adverse economic conditions affecting these industries may reduce demand for our products and services which may reduce our revenues profits or production levels some of our businesses serve industries such as power generation and petrochemical 

refining which may be negatively impacted in the event of future reductions in global capital expenditures and manufacturing capacity 

our indebtedness and any failure to comply with our covenants that apply to our indebtedness could materially and adversely affect our business 

as of december 29 2019 we had 8518 million total outstanding indebtedness including 2950 million in senior unsecured fixed rate notes 2798 million in euro denominated fixed rate notes 1500 million in term loans and 1250 million outstanding under our 7500 million floating rate credit facility our indebtedness or a failure to comply with our covenants that apply to our indebtedness could harm our business by among other things reducing the funds available to make acquisitions capital expenditures stock repurchases or reducing our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business or market conditions our indebtedness exposes us to interest rate risk since a portion of our debt obligations are at variable rates our indebtedness or a failure to comply with our covenants that apply to our indebtedness could also have a material adverse effect on our business by increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions or a downturn in our business general adverse economic and industry conditions or a downturn in our business could result in our inability to repay this indebtedness in a timely manner 

further the financial conduct authority the authority that regulates libor has announced that it intends to stop compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of libor after 2021 the alternative reference rates committee “arrc” has proposed that the secured overnight financing rate “sofr” is the rate that represents best practice as the alternative to usdlibor for use in debt instruments derivatives and other financial contracts that are currently indexed to usdlibor arrc has proposed a paced market transition plan to sofr from usdlibor and organizations are currently working on industry wide and company specific transition plans as it relates to derivatives debt and cash markets exposed to usdlibor it is unclear as to what the new method of calculating libor that may evolve and this new method could adversely affect the company’s interest rates on the company’s indebtedness the company is monitoring the arrc transition plan and is evaluating potential related risks as of december 29 2019 approximately 325 of the company’s longterm debt is variable and can be indexed to usdlibor a 2019 amendment to our 7500 million credit facility includes a procedure to switch to libor alternative replacement rates in the future 

we are subject to the risks associated with international sales and international operations which could harm our business or results of operations 

during 2019 sales to international customers accounted for approximately 44 of our total revenues compared with 47 in 2018 and 46 in 2017 in 2019 we sold products to customers in over 100 countries in 2019 the top five countries for international sales were china germany the united kingdom japan and south korea constituting approximately 21 of our total sales we anticipate that future sales to international customers will continue to account for a significant and increasing percentage of our revenues particularly since business and growth plans for many teledyne businesses focus on sales outside of the united states including to emerging markets such as china india brazil and west africa 

risks associated with international sales and operations include but are not limited to 

• political and economic instability 

• international terrorism 

• export controls including us export controls related to china sanctions related to russia and increased scrutiny of exports of marine instruments digital imaging and other products 

• failure to comply with antibribery legislation including the us foreign corrupt practices act 

• changes in legal and regulatory requirements 

• us and foreign government policy changes affecting the markets for our products 

• changes in tax laws and tariffs 

• changes in us  china and us  russia relations 

• difficulties in protection and enforcement of intellectual property rights 

• failure to comply with the foreign data protection laws including the eu general data protection regulation “gdpr” in the european union 

• inadvertent transfers of exportcontrolled information due to increased crossborder technology transfers and the use of offshore computer servers 

• transportation including piracy in international waters 

• currency exchange rate fluctuations and 

• challenges relating to managing a global workforce with diverse cultures and backgrounds 

any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition exchange rate fluctuations may increase the cost of our products to international customers and therefore reduce our competitive position 

in june 2016 the united kingdom “uk” held a referendum in which voters approved an exit from the european union “eu” commonly referred to as “brexit” the uk formally left the eu on january 31 2020 and has entered a transition period until december 31 2020 during the transition period the uk and the eu will seek to negotiate a trade deal and the uk will remain in both the eu customs union and single market the announcement of brexit caused significant volatility in global stock markets and currency exchange rate fluctuations that resulted in the strengthening of the us dollar against foreign currencies in which we conduct business the withdrawal of the uk from the eu may also create further global economic uncertainty which may adversely impact the economies of the uk the eu countries and other nations may cause our current and future customers to reduce their spending on our products and services and may cause certain eubased customers to source products from businesses based outside of the uk for example brexitrelated uncertainty could lead to a reconsideration by airbus as to future investment and spending in the uk which could reduce sales for our ukbased businesses that supply airbus potential brexitrelated risks for our ukbased businesses also include increased import duties loss of customers in the eu delays in the movement of goods between the uk and the eu and loss of access to the eu labor pool given our several ukbased businesses volatility in the value of the british pound relative to the us dollar or other foreign currencies could increase the cost of raw materials and components for our ukbased businesses and could otherwise adversely affect the business operations and the financial condition of our ukbased businesses 

acquisitions involve inherent risks that may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

our growth strategy includes acquisitions acquisitions involve various inherent risks such as 

• our ability to assess accurately the value strengths weaknesses internal controls contingent and other liabilities and potential profitability of acquisition candidates 

• the potential loss of key personnel of an acquired business 

• our ability to integrate acquired businesses and to achieve identified financial operating and other synergies anticipated to result from an acquisition 

• our ability to assess integrate and implement internal controls of acquired businesses in accordance with section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 

• the distraction of management resulting from the need to integrate acquired businesses 

• increased competition for acquisition targets which may increase acquisition costs 

• the potential impairment of assets 

• potential unknown liabilities associated with a business that we acquire or in which we invest including environmental liabilities 

• the risks associated with acquiring privatelyheld companies which generally do not have the same formal or comprehensive internal controls and compliance systems in place as public companies 

• production delays associated with consolidating acquired facilities and manufacturing operations 

• risks associated with owning and operating businesses internationally including those arising from us and foreign government policy changes or actions and currency exchange rate fluctuations 

• unanticipated changes in business or economic conditions affecting an acquired business and 

• exposure to new and unfamiliar regulations in new jurisdictions 

while we conduct financial and other due diligence in connection with our acquisitions and generally seek some form of protection such as indemnification from the seller insurance coverage and sometimes placing a portion of the purchase price in escrow to cover potential liabilities such acquired companies may have weaknesses or liabilities that are not accurately assessed or brought to our attention at the time of the acquisition further indemnities insurance or escrow arrangements may not fully cover such matters 

in connection with our acquisitions including those acquisitions that we do not complete we may incur significant transaction costs we are required to expense as incurred such transaction costs which may have a material adverse impact on our financial results 

changes in future business conditions could cause business investments goodwill and other longlived assets to become impaired resulting in significant losses and writedowns that would reduce our operating income 

on december 29 2019 teledyne’s goodwill was 20505 million and net acquired intangible assets were 4308 million under current accounting guidance we are required to test annually both acquired goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment based upon a fair value approach rather than amortizing the value over time we have chosen to perform our annual impairment reviews of goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year we also are required to test goodwill for impairment between annual tests if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce our enterprise fair value below its book value these events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate including a significant sustained decline in an entity’s market value legal factors operating performance indicators competition sale or disposition of a significant portion of the business or other factors if the fair market value is less than the carrying value including goodwill we could be required to record an impairment charge the valuation of reporting units requires judgment in estimating future cash flows discount rates and estimated product life 

cycles in making these judgments we evaluate the financial health of the business including such factors as industry performance changes in technology and operating cash flows as we have grown through acquisitions the amount of goodwill and net acquired intangible assets is a significant portion of our total assets as a result the amount of any annual or interim impairment could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our reported financial results for the period in which the charge is taken we also may be required to record an earnings charge or incur unanticipated expenses if as a result of a change in strategy or other reason we were to determine the value of other assets had been impaired 

for additional discussion of business investments goodwill and other longlived assets see the discussion under “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of operations and financial condition” and note 3 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

united states and global responses to terrorism increasing tension between the us and russia china and iran concerns regarding nuclear proliferation and the safety of nuclear energy potential epidemics such as the coronavirus continuing turmoil in middle eastern countries and potential future financial issues impacting airlines and volatile energy prices increase uncertainties with respect to many of our businesses and may adversely affect our business and results of operations  

united states’ and global responses to terrorism continuing turmoil in middle eastern countries and nuclear proliferation concerns increase uncertainties with respect to us and other business and financial markets and could adversely affect our business and operations increasing tensions between the us and russia and between the us and china as well as the us and iran could disrupt the economy 

air travel declines have occurred after terrorist attacks and heightened security alerts as well as after the highprofile outbreaks of disease including the recent outbreak and spread of the wuhan chinaoriginated coronavirus additional declines in air travel resulting from these factors and other factors could adversely affect the financial condition of many of our commercial airline and aircraft manufacturer customers and in turn could adversely affect our aerospace and defense electronics segment in addition a prolonged virus epidemic or pandemic or the threat thereof could result in worker absences lower productivity voluntary closure of our offices and manufacturing facilities disruptions in our supply chain travel restrictions on our employees and other disruptions to our businesses moreover health epidemics may force local health and government authorities to mandate the temporary closure of our offices and manufacturing facilities 

with the outbreak of the coronavirus chinese authorities quarantined many cities and restricted travel within the country we asked our approximately 140 employees based in china not to report to our facilities and restricted travel to china similar actions have been taken by our chinabased and other suppliers and customers many commercial airlines and countries have canceled flights and restricted travel to and from china if the virus spreads further and chinese business continue to be shutdown or delayed it could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

higher oil prices could adversely affect commercial airlinerelated customers of our aerospace and defense electronics segment conversely lower oil prices have decreased oil exploration and petrochemical refining activities and have hindered our marine and other instrumentation businesses in addition instability in the middle east or other oilproducing regions could adversely affect expansion plans of the oil and gas industry customers of our instrumentation businesses 

our revenue from government contracts subjects us to many risks 

our revenue from us government contracts depends on the continued availability of funding from the us government and accordingly we have the risk that funding for our existing contracts may be canceled or diverted to other uses or delayed or that funding for new programs will not be available 

we perform work on a number of contracts with the us department of defense and other agencies and departments of the us government including subcontracts with government prime contractors sales under contracts with the us government including sales under contracts with the us department of defense as prime contractor or subcontractor represented approximately 24 of our total revenue in 2019 compared with 23 in 2018 and 24 in 2017 performance under government contracts has inherent risks that could have a material effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

government contracts are conditioned upon the continuing availability of congressional appropriations and the failure of congress to appropriate funds for programs in which we participate could negatively affect our results of operations us government shutdowns have resulted in delays in anticipated contract awards and delayed payments of invoices for several of our businesses and any new shutdown could have similar or worse effects the failure by congress to approve future budgets on a timely basis could delay procurement of our products and services and cause us to lose future revenues any renewed emphasis on federal deficit and debt reduction could lead to a further decrease in overall defense spending budgetary concerns could result in future contracts being awarded more on price than on other competitive factors and smaller defense budgets could result in government insourcing of programs and more intense competition on programs that are not insourced which could result in lower revenues and profits 

although the us president has indicated his desire for increased defense spending continued defense spending does not necessarily correlate to continued business for us because not all of the programs in which we participate or have current capabilities may be provided with continued funding changes in policy and budget priorities by the president his administration and the us congress for various defense and national aeronautics and space administration “nasa” programs could continue to impact our engineered systems aerospace and defense electronics and digital imaging segments our aerospace and defense electronics segment may be impacted by volume or price reductions in connection with the f35 joint strike fighter program to the extent they are imposed the timing of program cycles can affect our results of operations for a quarter or year and cancellations of significant programs such as the space launch system “sls” launch vehicle stage adapter “lvsa” international space station “iss” mission operations and integration “moi” or the shallow water combat submersible “swcs” would affect our results it is also not uncommon for the us department of defense to delay the timing of awards for major programs for six to twelve months reductions and delays in research and development funding by the us government could impact our revenues uncertainty over budgets or priorities with the existing or a different us presidential administration following the 2020 election could result in delays in funding and the timing of awards and changes in funded programs that could have a material impact on our revenues 

our participation in government programs may decrease as those programs evolve over time 

over time and for a variety of reasons programs can evolve and affect the extent of our participation we have been a significant participant in nasa programs primarily through our engineered systems segment and through teledyne scientific and imaging llc the prior us presidential administration introduced significant changes to the national space policy including the cancellation of nasa’s constellation program which includes ares launch vehicles delayed funding and changes in support for nasa’s current space policy including the space launch system “sls” international space station “iss” or artemis mission to the moon could negatively impact our business furthermore while funding for national space has been more positive under the current us presidential administration a different us presidential administration following the 2020 election could make changes to funding for national space that could be less favorable 

furthermore the us government continues to place emphasis on small business quotas and may continue to increase small business contract set asides and minimum work percentages in some cases prime contractors are required to reduce participation by large subcontractors like teledyne in order to fill small business quotas and be responsive to proposals and bids as a result our engineered systems segment could lose participation in some government programs 

our contracts with the us government are subject to termination rights that could adversely affect us 

most of our us government contracts are subject to termination by the us government either at its convenience or upon the default of the contractor termination for convenience provisions provide only for the recovery of costs incurred or committed settlement expenses and profit on work completed prior to termination termination for default clauses impose liability on the contractor for excess costs incurred by the us government in reprocuring undelivered items from another source we had three us government contracts terminated for convenience in 2019 compared with 15 in 2018 and nine in 2017 no contracts were terminated for default during such threeyear period 

we may lose money or generate less than expected profits on our fixedprice and other government contracts and if we fail to meet certain prespecified targets in government contracts we may lose money 

there is no guarantee that us government contracts will be profitable a number of our us government prime contracts and subcontracts are fixedprice type contracts 64 of our total revenue from us government contracts came from fixedprice in 2019 67 in 2018 and 58 in 2017 under these types of contracts we bear the financial risk that actual performance cost may exceed the fixed contract price under such contracts we must absorb cost overruns notwithstanding the difficulty of estimating all of the costs we will incur in performing these contracts we cannot assure that our contract loss provisions in our financial statements will be adequate to cover all actual future losses as the technological complexity and required performance levels for our products increase which is occurring in many of our businesses it becomes more challenging to estimate costs we may lose money or generate lower profits on some contracts if we fail to meet these estimates we may also lose money on nonfixed price costreimbursement contracts that contain penalties related to cost schedule or performance furthermore some of our research and development programs for the government may get canceled or descoped should we fail to meet certain technical goals 

additionally as we continue to support legacy defense programs certain components become more difficult to source there is a risk that we may not be able to source critical components which could lead to cost overruns 

our us government contracting business is subject to government contracting regulations including increasingly complex regulations on cybersecurity and our failure to comply with such laws and regulations could harm our operating results and prospects 

our us government contracting businesses like other government contractors are subject to various audits reviews and investigations including private party “whistleblower” lawsuits relating to our compliance with applicable federal and state laws and regulations more routinely the us government may audit the costs we incur on our us government contracts including allocated indirect costs such audits could result in adjustments to our contract costs any costs found to be improperly allocated to a specific contract will not be reimbursed and such costs already reimbursed would need to be refunded we have recorded contract revenues based upon costs we expect to realize after final audit in a worst case scenario should a business or division involved be charged with wrongdoing or should the us government determine that the business or division is not a “presently responsible contractor” that business or division and conceivably our company as a whole could be temporarily suspended or in the event of a conviction could be debarred for up to three years from receiving new government contracts or governmentapproved subcontracts in addition we could expend substantial amounts defending against such charges and in damages fines and penalties if such charges were proven or were to result in negotiated settlements 

the department of defense as well as other us government contracting agencies have adopted rules and regulations requiring contractors to implement a set of cyber security measures to attain the safeguarding of contractor systems that process store or transmit certain information implementation and compliance with these cyber security requirements is complex and costly and could result in unforeseen expenses lower profitability and in the case of noncompliance penalties and damages all of which could have an adverse effect on our business 

our pension expense and the value of our pension assets are affected by factors outside of our control including the performance of plan assets the stock market interest rates and actuarial experience 

our domestic qualified defined benefit pension plans cover most of our us employees hired prior to 2004 or approximately 10 of our active employees we also have several small domestic nonqualified and foreignbased pension plans as of december 29 2019 the value of the combined pension assets is greater than our combined pension benefit obligations the accounting rules applicable to our pension plans require that amounts recognized in the financial statements be determined on an actuarial basis rather than as contributions are made to the plan two significant elements in determining our pension income or pension expense are the expected return on plan assets and the discount rate used in projecting pension benefit obligations declines in the stock market and lower rates of return could increase required contributions to our qualified pension plan andor result in a change to shareholders’ equity our investment strategy may not produce the expected returns if the credit financial or stock markets deteriorate any decreases or increases in market interest rates will affect the discount rate assumption used in projecting pension benefit obligations in addition changes in other actuarial assumptions such as mortality assumptions or change due to legislative or regulatory actions could impact our pension income or expense as well as funding obligations each year beginning in 2014 the society of actuaries has released revised mortality tables which updated life expectancy assumptions in consideration of these tables each year we review the mortality assumptions used in determining our pension and postretirement benefit obligations the impact of these mortality assumptions could increase our pension obligation and increase future pension expense no contributions have been made to the domestic qualified pension plan since 2013 if and to the extent decreases in our pension assets are not offset by voluntary contributions recovered through future asset returns mitigated by an increase in the rate at which the benefit obligation is discounted or other actions our required cash contributions and pension expense could increase under the plans in addition we have sold approximately 639 million in pension liability to third parties to the extent any of these counterparties are unable to fulfill their obligations to retirees we may have residual liability particularly to the extent state guarantee funds are inadequate for additional discussion of pension matters see the discussion under “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of operations and financial condition” and notes 2 11 and 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

our business and operations could suffer in the event of cyber security breaches 

attempts by others to gain unauthorized access to our information technology systems have become more sophisticated and are sometimes successful these attempts which might be related to industrial or foreign government espionage crime activism or other motivations include covertly introducing malware into our computers and computer networks performing reconnaissance impersonating authorized users extortion stealing corrupting or restricting our access to data among other activities we continue to train our personnel and update our infrastructure security tools and processes to protect against security incidents including both external and internal threats and to prevent their recurrence company personnel and third parties have been tasked to detect respond to and investigate such incidents but it is possible that we might not prevent or be aware of or be able to react to an incident or its magnitude and effects the theft corruption unauthorized use or publication of our intellectual property or confidential business information could harm our competitive position reduce the value of our investment in research and development and other strategic initiatives or otherwise adversely affect our business we are subject to us department of defense regulations applicable to certain types of data residing on or transiting through our information systems and these regulations have been and will continue to be incorporated into certain us department of 

defense contracts that we hold to the extent that any security breach results in inappropriate disclosure of confidential or controlled information of employees third parties or the us government or any of the deployed security controls are deemed insufficient we may incur liability or the loss of contracts or security clearances as a result we expect to continue to devote additional resources to the security of our information technology systems more resources may be required in the defense arena to the extent the us government increases its cyber security mandates unauthorized access to or control of our products devices or systems could impact the safety of our customers and other third parties which could result in legal claims against us security breaches also could result in a violation of applicable us and international privacy and other laws including the eu general data protection regulation “gdpr” health insurance portability and accountability act “hipaa” payment card industry data security standard “pci” and california consumer privacy act “ccpa” and subject us to private consumer or securities litigation and governmental investigations and proceedings any of which could result in our exposure to material civil or criminal liability 

we may not have sufficient resources to fund all future research and development and capital expenditures or possible acquisitions 

in order to remain competitive we must make substantial investments in research and development of new or enhanced products and continuously upgrade our process technology and manufacturing capabilities our research and development efforts primarily involve engineering and design related to improving existing products and developing new products and technologies in the same or similar fields our teledyne scientific company subsidiary which serves as our primary research center has been actively promoting and funding joint research and development projects with other teledyne businesses including teledyne oil  gas teledyne defense electronics teledyne digital imaging and our test and measurement businesses the business of e2v for which the design and development of specialized technology for high performance systems and equipment is integral also requires substantial investments in research and development additionally some of our businesses have sought or are actively pursuing governmental support and funding for some of their research and development initiatives including funding in 2019 for dalsa’s semiconductor foundry in bromont quebec nonetheless we may be unable to fund all of our research and development and capital investment needs or possible strategic acquisitions of businesses or product lines our ability to raise additional capital will depend on a variety of factors some of which will not be within our control including the existence of bank and capital markets investor perceptions of us our businesses and the industries in which we operate and general economic conditions failure to successfully raise needed capital or generate cash flow on a timely or costeffective basis could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition in addition if we fail to accurately predict future customer needs and preferences or fail to produce viable technologies we may invest heavily in research and development of products that do not lead to significant revenue which would adversely affect our profitability 

limitations in customer funding for applied research and development and limitations in government support for research and development expenditures may reduce our ability to apply our ongoing investments in some market areas 

we may be unable to successfully introduce new and enhanced products in a timely and costeffective manner or increase our participation in new markets which could harm our profitability and prospects 

our operating results depend in part on our ability to introduce new and enhanced products on a timely basis we have major development activities at some of our businesses for which a failure to execute in a timely manner could negatively impact those businesses in order to improve our product development capabilities we purchased the research center that is now teledyne scientific company in 2006 and in 2011 we purchased dalsa to gain access to a wellequipped mems research and development center in 2013 we opened a 52000squarefoot technology development center in daytona beach florida primarily to serve the offshore oil and gas production and exploration industries we are currently upgrading infrastructure at teledyne e2v’s facility in chelmsford uk and have expanded teledyne dalsa’s mems foundry in bromont quebec as well as acquired a second mems foundry in edmonton alberta as part of the micralyne acquisition successful product development and introduction depend on numerous factors including our ability to anticipate customer and market requirements changes in technology and industry standards our ability to differentiate our product offerings from the product offerings of our competitors and market acceptance we may not be able to develop and introduce new or enhanced products in a timely and costeffective manner or to develop and introduce products that satisfy customer requirements 

our new products also may not achieve market acceptance or correctly address new industry standards and technological changes we may also lose any technological advantage to competitors if we fail to develop new products in a timely manner 

additionally new products may trigger increased warranty costs as information on such products is augmented by actual usage accelerated entry of new products to meet heightened market demand and competitive pressures may cause additional warranty costs as development and testing time periods might be accelerated or condensed 

we intend to both adapt our existing technologies and develop new products to expand into new market segments we may be unsuccessful in accessing these and other new markets if our products do not meet our customers’ requirements as a result of changes in either technology and industry standards or because of actions taken by our competitors 

technological change and evolving industry and regulatory standards could cause some of our products or services to become obsolete or noncompetitive 

the markets for some of our products and services are characterized by rapid technological development evolving industry standards changes in customer requirements and new product introductions and enhancements a faster than anticipated change in one or more of the technologies related to our products or services or in market demand for products or services based on a particular technology could result in faster than anticipated obsolescence of certain of our products or services and could lead to reduced sales of those products which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition currently accepted industry and regulatory standards are also subject to change which may contribute to the obsolescence of our products or services the political agenda of the us presidential administration may affect the level of environmental regulations and enforcement and government spending on scientific research which could adversely impact the sales of our products and services including sales of pollution monitoring instruments and instruments used to measure the earth’s climate and climate change such as undersea gliders and spacebased imaging sensors a change in china’s economic policies promoting pollution reduction could result in lower sales or slower sales growth for our pollution monitoring and laboratory instrumentation to china 

we may not be able to reduce the costs of our products to satisfy customers’ cost reduction mandates which could harm our sales or margins 

cost conscious customers may seek price reductions of our products while we continually work to reduce our manufacturing and other costs of our products without affecting product quality and reliability there is no assurance that we will be able to do so or to do so in a timely manner to satisfy the pricing pressures of our customers prices of raw materials and other components used in our products may be beyond our control depending on market conditions as a result customers may seek lower cost products from china or other developing countries where manufacturing costs are lower 

the airline industry is heavily regulated and if we fail to comply with applicable requirements our results of operations could suffer 

the federal aviation administration “faa” and equivalent regulatory agencies have increasingly focused on the need to assure that airline industry products are designed with sufficient cybersecurity controls to protect against unauthorized access or other unwanted compromise a failure to meet these evolving expectations could negatively impact sales into the industry and expose us to legal or contractual liability 

governmental agencies throughout the world including the faa prescribe standards and qualification requirements for aircraft components including virtually all commercial airline and general aviation products specific regulations vary from country to country although compliance with faa requirements generally satisfies regulatory requirements in other countries if any material authorization or approval qualifying us to supply our products is revoked or suspended then sale of the product would be prohibited by law which would have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

from time to time the faa or equivalent regulatory agencies in other countries propose new regulations or changes to existing regulations which often are more stringent than existing regulations if such proposals are adopted and enacted we may incur significant additional costs to achieve compliance which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations recent trends by china’s aviation authority to relax restrictions on airspace may be reversed and anticipated new regulations loosening airspace restrictions may not materialize which could impact sales prospects in china for our commercial aerospace businesses 

the faa and the us department of justice’s fraud section among other agencies and countries are investigating two boeing 737 max 8 aircraft crashes that occurred in october 2018 and march 2019 which resulted in the groundings of such aircraft across the world while the investigations continue boeing announced in december 2019 that it will temporarily suspend production of the 737 max starting in january 2020 while the impact of this decision has been factored into our business plans there is a risk that the decision will have further negative impact on our teledyne controls’ business particularly if the suspension lasts longer than expected 

increasing competition could reduce the demand for our products and services 

each of our markets is highly competitive many of our competitors have and potential competitors could have greater name recognition a larger installed base of products more extensive engineering manufacturing marketing and distribution capabilities and greater financial technological and personnel resources new or existing competitors may also develop new technologies that could adversely affect the demand for our products and services we have been experiencing increased competition for some of our key products furthermore some of our patents have or are expiring which could open up further competition for example our us patent related to our wireless groundlink product expired in 2018 allowing several competitors to enter the market additionally some of our customers have been developing competing products or electing to vertically integrate and replace our products with their own for example airbus has developed its own wireless product fomax that now competes directly with teledyne controls hardware and services furthermore boeing has announced a vertical integration program which include avionics lastly some of our products face increasing competition from alternative technologies for example the lead acid batteries that teledyne battery products sells face competition from lithium ion batteries among other competing technologies 

industry acquisition and consolidation trends particularly among aerospace and defense contractors have adversely impacted demand for our aerospace and defense related engineering services as large prime contractors elect to insource major acquisition programs and expand small business participation to meet government contracting goals such consolidations can also cause delays in business as the newly consolidated organization undergoes integration 

lowcost competition from china and other developing countries could also result in decreased demand for our products increasing competition could reduce the volume of our sales or the prices we may charge which would negatively impact our revenues smaller defense budgets both in the united states and europe could result in additional competition for new and existing defense programs 

product liability claims product recalls and field service actions could have a material adverse effect on our reputation business results of operations and financial condition and we may have difficulty obtaining product liability and other insurance coverage 

as a manufacturer and distributor of a wide variety of products including monitoring instruments products used in offshore oil and gas production products used in transportation and commercial aviation and products used in medical devices including xray detectors our results of operations are susceptible to adverse publicity regarding the quality or safety of our products in part product liability claims challenging the safety of our products may result in a decline in sales for a product which could adversely affect our results of operations this could be the case even if the claims themselves are proven to be untrue or settled for immaterial amounts 

while we have general liability and other insurance policies concerning product liabilities and errors and omissions we have selfinsured retentions or deductibles under such policies with respect to a portion of these liabilities awarded damages could be more than our accruals we could incur losses above the aggregate annual policy limit as well we cannot assure that for 2020 and in future years insurance carriers will be willing to renew coverage or provide new coverage for product liability 

product recalls can be expensive and tarnish our reputation and have a material adverse effect on the sales of our products we cannot assure that we will not have additional product liability claims or that we will not recall any products 

we have been joined among a number of defendants often over 100 in lawsuits alleging injury or death as a result of exposure to asbestos in addition because of the prominent “teledyne” name we may continue to be mistakenly joined in lawsuits involving a company or business that was not assumed by us as part of our 1999 spinoff to date we have not incurred material liabilities in connection with these lawsuits however our historic insurance coverage including that of our predecessors may not fully cover such claims and the defense of such matters coverage typically depends on the year of purported exposure and other factors nonetheless we intend to vigorously defend our position against these claims 

teledyne brown engineering inc and other teledyne companies manufacture components for customers in the nuclear power market including utilities and certain governmental entities certain liabilities associated with such products are covered by the priceanderson nuclear industries indemnity act and other statutory and common law defenses and we have received indemnities from some of our customers however there is no assurance we will not face product liability claims related to such products or that our exposure will not exceed the amounts for which we have liability coverage or protection 

our business and financial results could be adversely affected by conditions and other factors associated with our suppliers 

some items we purchase for the manufacture of our products are purchased from limited or single sources of supply due to technical capability price and other factors for example teledyne digital imaging has an internal single source of supply for ccd semiconductor wafers used to assemble image sensors and an external single source of supply for cmos semiconductor wafers used to assemble xray panel products furthermore sole source supply is more common among our research and development businesses because there can be few suppliers in the world capable of producing the products or providing the services with the right highly specialized technology lecroy continues to outsource a portion of its research and development activities to thirdparty engineering firms in malaysia and india where it may be more difficult for us to enforce our intellectual property rights we have also outsourced from time to time the manufacturing of certain parts components subsystems and even finished products to single or limited sources including international sources disruption of these sources or supplierimposed rationing of scarce components could cause delays or reductions in shipments of our products or increases in our costs which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or operations we could experience global supply chain disruptions if the coronavirus heath crisis continues and widens international sources possess additional risks some of which are similar to those described above regarding international sales with any continuing disruption in the global economy and financial markets some of our suppliers may also continue to face issues gaining access to sufficient credit and materials to maintain their businesses which could reduce the availability of some components and to the extent such suppliers are single source suppliers could adversely affect our ability to continue to manufacture and sell our products 

we face risks related to sales through distributors and other third parties that we do not control which could harm our business 

we sell a portion of our products through third parties such as distributors valueadded resellers and oems collectively “distributors” using third parties for distribution exposes teledyne to many risks including concentration credit risk and legal risk because under certain circumstances we may be held responsible for the action of those thirdparty sales channels even though we exercise less control over them than we do our directly employed sales personnel we may rely on one or more key distributors for a product and the loss of these distributors could reduce our revenue distributors may face financial difficulties including bankruptcy which could harm our collection of accounts receivables and financial results violations of the foreign corrupt practices act “fcpa” or similar antibribery laws by distributors or other thirdparty intermediaries could have a material impact on our business competitors could also block our access to key distributors failing to manage risks related to our use of distributors may reduce sales increase expenses and weaken our competitive position and could result in sanctions against us 

compliance with increasing environmental and climate change regulations as well as the effects of potential environmental liabilities could have a material adverse financial effect on us 

we like other industry participants are subject to various federal state local and international environmental laws and regulations we may be subject to increasingly stringent environmental standards in the future particularly as greenhouse gas emissions and climate change regulations and initiatives increase future developments administrative actions or liabilities relating to environmental and climate change matters could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition environmental regulations on hydraulic fracturing and the use of seismic energy sources for offshore energy exploration could adversely affect some product lines of our instrumentation segment 

our manufacturing operations including former operations could expose us to material environmental liabilities additionally companies that we acquire may have environmental liabilities that might not be accurately assessed or brought to our attention at the time of the acquisition 

the us environmental protection agency “epa” has focused on greenhouse gases “ghgs” maintaining ghgs threaten the public health and welfare of the american people the epa also maintains that ghg emissions from onroad vehicles contribute to that threat the epa’s endangerment finding covers emissions of six greenhouse gases the epa’s continuing efforts to limit ghg emissions could adversely affect our us manufacturing operations increase prices for energy fuel and transportation require us to accommodate changes in parameters such as the way parts are manufactured and may in some cases require us to redesign certain of our products this or other federal or state regulations could lead to increased costs which we may not be able to recover from customers delays in product shipments and loss of market share to competitors for example teledyne battery products unit makes lead acid batteries in california and is subject to a variety of environmental regulations and inspections which have increased over time also some of our sites conduct electroplating metal finishing and other operations that utilize hazardous materials that are subject to similar regulations regulatory changes or failure to meet applicable requirements could disrupt that business or force a closure or relocation of the business 

our products are subject to various regulations that prohibit or restrict the use of certain hazardous substances for example our products placed on the european market are subject to the registration evaluation authorization and restriction of chemicals “reach” and the restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment “rohs” directives future hazardous substance restrictions or prohibitions may limit our ability to market some products in certain countries 

for additional discussion of environmental matters see the discussion under the caption “other matters – environmental” of “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of results of operation and financial condition” and note 14 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our products that contribute to the environment sustainability and climate science see “item 1 business – environment and sustainability” 

our inability to attract and retain key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our future success 

our future success depends to a significant extent upon the continued service of our executive officers and other key management and technical personnel and on our ability to continue to attract retain and motivate qualified personnel we also have a maturing workforce some of our businesses including our businesses in traveling wave tube and integrated microwave module design and development draw from a pool of specialized engineering talent that is small and currently shrinking some of our businesses have a need for employees with a certain level of security clearance and competition for such employees has increased while we have engaged in succession planning the loss of the services of one or more of our key employees or our failure to attract retain and motivate qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations low unemployment in the united states has made it more difficult for some of our businesses to attract and retain direct labor in certain markets 

we may not be able to sell or reconfigure businesses facilities or product lines that we determine no longer meet with our growth strategy or that should be consolidated 

consistent with our strategy to emphasize growth in our core markets we continually evaluate our businesses to ensure that they are aligned with our strategy and objectives over the years we have also consolidated some of our business units and facilities in some cases to respond to downturns in the defense and oil and gas industries among other reasons we are currently in the process of closing our teledyne paradise datacom facility in state college pennsylvania and moving its operations to our teledyne microwave solutions facility in rancho cordova california we may not be able to realize efficiencies and cost savings from our consolidation activities there is no assurance that our efforts will be successful if we do not successfully manage our current consolidation activities or any other similar activities that we may undertake in the future expected efficiencies and benefits might be delayed or not realized and our operations and business could be disrupted our ability to dispose of exit or reconfigure businesses that may no longer be aligned with our growth strategy will depend on many factors including the terms and conditions of any asset purchase and sale agreement or lease agreement as well as industry business and economic conditions we cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to sell nonstrategic businesses on terms that are acceptable to us or at all in addition if the sale of any nonstrategic business cannot be consummated or is not practical alternative courses of action including relocation of product lines or closure may not be available to us or may be more costly than anticipated 

natural and manmade disasters could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

several of our facilities as a result of their locations could be subject to a catastrophic loss caused by earthquakes hurricanes tornados floods ice storms or other natural disasters many of our production facilities and our headquarters are located in california and thus are in areas with above average seismic activity and may also be at risk of damage due to wildfires in november 2018 wildfires impacted areas near our headquarters and principal research and development center in thousand oaks california resulting in temporary disruptions and evacuations of employees who lived nearby local utilities may impose blackouts during high fire risk weather conditions which could result in disruptions to our businesses located in california including our headquarters teledyne dalsa’s semiconductor facilities in quebec canada have been impacted by loss of electrical power caused by severe ice storms in addition we have manufacturing facilities in the southeastern united states and texas that have been threatened or struck by major hurricanes in 2017 our businesses located in houston texas were impacted by hurricane harvey and our business in florida was threatened by hurricanes irma and matthew our facilities in alabama florida nebraska tennessee and virginia have also been threatened by tornados if any of our california facilities including our california headquarters were to experience a catastrophic earthquake or wildfire loss or if any of our alabama florida nebraska tennessee or texas facilities were to experience a catastrophic hurricane storm tornado or other natural disaster or if dalsa’s facilities in quebec experience longterm loss of electrical power such event could disrupt our operations delay production shipments and revenue and result in large expenses to repair or replace the facility or facilities while teledyne has property insurance to partially reimburse it for losses caused by windstorm and earth movement such insurance would not cover all possible losses in addition our existing disaster recovery and business continuity plans including those relating to our information technology systems may not be fully responsive to or minimize losses associated with catastrophic events 

disasters also have an indirect adverse impact on our business for example in 2018 a fire at a netherlandsbased facility of a key supplier of printed circuit boards resulted in delivery disruptions to the electronics industry including to businesses in our digital imaging segment 

teledyne brown engineering inc has developed built and launched a multiuser system for earth sensing that is affixed to the international space station “iss” for the program to continue to be financially successful the 20yearold iss must continue to fly in a safe and human tended condition while certain spaceflight risks such as a highvelocity debris impact to the station causing significant structural damage or necessitating the evacuation of the iss have been regarded as small if such event were to occur the iss program continuation could be threatened jeopardizing our investment and potential revenue generation from issbased earth imaging 

we may not be able to enforce or protect our intellectual property rights or third parties may claim we infringe their intellectual rights each which may harm our ability to compete and thus harm our business 

our ability to enforce and protect our patents copyrights software licenses trade secrets knowhow and other intellectual property rights is subject to general litigation risks as well as uncertainty as to the enforceability of our intellectual property rights in various countries when we seek to enforce our rights we have found that various claims may be asserted against us including claims that our intellectual property right is invalid is otherwise not enforceable or is licensed to the party against whom we are asserting a claim in addition we may be the target of aggressive and opportunistic enforcement of patents by third parties if we are not ultimately successful in defending ourselves against these claims in litigation we may not be able to sell a product or family of products due to an injunction or we may have to pay damages that could in turn harm our results of operations our inability to enforce our intellectual property rights under these circumstances may harm our competitive position and our business 

higher tax rates may harm our results of operations and cash flow 

our effective tax rate for 2019 was 151 compared with 153 for 2018 and 208 for 2017 while in december 2017 the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 was signed into law which in general lowered corporate tax rates in the united states a number of factors may impact our effective tax rates which could reduce our net income and increase our tax payments including 

• the relative amount of income we earn in other jurisdictions 

• changes in tax laws or their interpretation including changes in the united states to the taxation of foreign income and expenses changes in tax laws in foreign jurisdictions and changes in us generally accepted accounting principles and governing body pronouncements and interpretations 

• the resolution of issues arising from tax audits 

• changes in valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities including deferred tax valuation allowances 

• adjustments to income taxes upon finalization of tax returns 

• increases in expense not deductible for tax purposes 

• changes in available tax credits and 

• any decision to repatriate nonus earnings for which we have not made provision for us taxes 

our financial statements are based on estimates required by generally accepted accounting principles in the united states “gaap” and actual results may differ materially from those estimated under different assumptions or conditions 

our financial statements are prepared in conformity with gaap these principles require our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period for example estimates are used when accounting for items such as revenue asset valuations allowances for doubtful accounts allowance for excess and obsolete inventory depreciation and amortization impairment assessments employee benefits taxes recall and warranty costs product and general liability and contingencies while we base our estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances at the time made actual results may differ materially from those estimated our most critical accounting estimates are described in “item 7 management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in this form 10k under “critical accounting estimates” 

there are inherent limitations in internal control systems and misstatements resulting from error or fraud may occur and may not be detected 

we continue to act to assure compliance with the internal controls disclosure controls and other requirements of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer cannot guarantee that our internal controls and disclosure controls will prevent all possible errors or all fraud a control system no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met in addition the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefit of controls must be relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no system of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within the company have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake further controls can be circumvented by individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more persons or by management override of the controls the design of any system of controls is also based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions over time a control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate because of inherent limitations in a costeffective control system misstatements resulting from error or fraud may occur and may not be detected 

provisions of our governing documents applicable law and our change in control severance agreements could make an acquisition of teledyne more difficult 

our restated certificate of incorporation our amended and restated bylaws and the general corporation law of the state of delaware contain several provisions that could make the acquisition of control of teledyne in a transaction not approved by our board of directors more difficult we have also entered into change in control severance agreements with ten members of our current management which could have an antitakeover effect these provisions may prevent or discourage attempts to acquire our company 

the market price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly since we became a public company and could continue to do so 

the market price of our common stock has fluctuated substantially and fluctuations in our stock price could continue in 2019 the price of our common stock ranged from 19815 to 35153 subsequent to yearend 2019 our common stock hit a high of 39899 on january 22 2020 on february 21 2020 the closing price of our common stock was 38566 

among the factors that could affect our stock price are 

• quarterly variations in our operating results 

• strategic actions by us or our competitors 

• acquisitions 

• divestitures 

• stock repurchases 

• adverse business developments 

• war in the middle east or elsewhere 

• terrorists activities 

• military or homeland defense activities 

• changes to the us federal budget or other government budgets 

• changes in the energy exploration or production semiconductor digital imaging telecommunications commercial aviation and electronic manufacturing services markets 

• general market conditions 

• changes in tax laws 

• general economic factors unrelated to our performance 

• changes from analysts’ expectations in revenues earnings or other financial results and 

• one or more of the risk factors described in this report 

stock markets in general and the markets for hightechnology companies in particular have experienced a high degree of volatility that is not necessarily related to the operating performance of these companies we cannot provide assurances as to our stock price we have in the past repurchased shares of our stock pursuant to boardapproved stock repurchase programs we cannot provide assurances that we will continue to repurchase shares under those programs or that our board will authorize new repurchase programs

strategyoverview 

our strategy continues to emphasize growth in our core markets of instrumentation digital imaging aerospace and defense electronics and engineered systems our core markets are characterized by high barriers to entry and include specialized products and services not likely to be commoditized we intend to strengthen and expand our core businesses with targeted acquisitions and through product development we continue to focus on balanced and disciplined capital deployment among capital expenditures acquisitions product development and share repurchases we aggressively pursue operational excellence to continually improve our margins and earnings by emphasizing cost containment and cost reductions in all aspects of our business at teledyne operational excellence includes the rapid integration of the businesses we acquire using complementary technology across our businesses and internal research and development we seek to create new products to grow our company and expand our addressable markets we continue to evaluate our businesses to ensure that they are aligned with our strategy 

consistent with this strategy we made three acquisitions in 2019 and in march 2017 we made our largest acquisition to date e2v technologies plc “e2v” see the recent acquisitions section following this section 

in the third quarter of 2019 we realigned the segment reporting structure for certain business units primarily related to certain refinements of our management reporting structure this change primarily related to moving certain electronic manufacturing services products from the aerospace and defense electronics segment to the engineered systems segment total net sales for these products were 762 million for fiscal year 2018 other immaterial changes included moving certain united kingdom “uk” microwave product lines previously within the digital imaging segment and certain uk manufactured composite parts previously within the engineered systems segment into the aerospace and defense electronics segment total net sales for these uk product lines was less than 200 million for fiscal year 2018 the realignment had no impact on the instrumentation segment or the consolidated financial statements see note 12 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on the realignment previously reported segment data has been adjusted to reflect these changes 

as part of a continuing effort to reduce costs and improve operating performance we may take and have taken actions to consolidate and relocate certain facilities and reduce headcount across various businesses reducing our exposure to weak end markets and high cost locations we continue to seek cost reductions in our businesses at december 29 2019 15 million remains to be paid related to these actions

financial condition liquidity and capital resources 

principal cash and capital requirements 

our principal cash and capital requirements are to fund working capital needs capital expenditures income tax payments and debt service requirements as well as acquisitions we may deploy cash for stock repurchases it is anticipated that operating cash flow together with available borrowings under the credit facility described below will be sufficient to meet these requirements and could be used to fund acquisitions in 2020 to support acquisitions we may need to raise additional capital our liquidity is not dependent upon the use of offbalance sheet financial arrangements we have no offbalance sheet financing arrangements that incorporate the use of special purpose or unconsolidated entities 

credit facility senior notes and term loans 



at december 29 2019 we had 292 million in outstanding letters of credit 

on march 15 2019 teledyne amended its 7500 million credit agreement to extend the maturity date from december 2020 to march 2024 while the borrowing capacity remains at 7500 million the amendment permits teledyne to increase the aggregate amount of the borrowing capacity by up to 2500 million subject to certain conditions excluding interest and fees no payments are due under the 7500 million unsecured credit facility “credit facility” until it matures borrowings under our credit facility and term loans are at variable rates which are at our option tied to a eurocurrency rate equal to libor london interbank offered rate plus an applicable rate or a base rate as defined in our credit agreements eurocurrency rate loans may be denominated in us dollars or an alternative currency as defined in the agreement eurocurrency or libor based loans under the facility typically have terms of one two three or six months and the interest rate for each such loan is subject to change if the loan is continued or converted following the applicable maturity date the company has not drawn any loans with a term longer than three months under the credit facility base rate loans have interest rates that primarily fluctuate with changes in the prime rate interest rates are also subject to change based on our consolidated leverage ratio as defined in the credit agreement the credit facility also provides for facility fees that vary between 012 and 025 of the credit line depending on our consolidated leverage ratio 

in october 2019 teledyne and its subsidiary teledyne netherlands bv as borrowers entered into an amended and restated term loan credit agreement the “amended term loan credit agreement” that amends and restates the term loan credit agreement dated as of march 17 2017 pursuant to the amended term loan credit agreement the lenders thereunder made unsecured term loans in an aggregate principal amount of 1500 million denominated in us dollars 1000 million of which was used to repay outstanding loans which had a maturity date of october 30 2019 also on october 30 2019 

teledyne entered into a cross currency swap to effectively convert the 1500 million term loan to a €1352 million denominated instrument with a fixed euro interest rate of 0612 

our credit facility senior notes and term loans agreements require the company to comply with various financial and operating covenants including maintaining certain consolidated leverage and interest coverage ratios as well as minimum net worth levels and limits on acquired debt at december 29 2019 the company was in compliance with these covenants and we had a significant amount of margin between required financial covenant ratios and our actual ratios currently we do not believe our ability to undertake additional debt financing if needed is reasonably likely to be materially impacted by debt restrictions under our credit agreements subject to our complying with required financial covenants listed in the table below 

financial covenant ratios and the actual ratios at december 29 2019 



a the consolidated leverage ratio is equal to net debtebitda as defined in our private placement note purchase agreement and our 7500 million credit agreement 

b the consolidated interest coverage ratio is equal to ebitdainterest as defined in our private placement note purchase agreement and our 7500 million credit agreement 

in the event of an acquisition our credit agreements permit us at our option to exceed the consolidated leverage ratio of 325 to 1 for up to four quarters following the fiscal quarter in which the acquisition event occurs provided that the consolidated leverage ratio does not exceed 35 to 1 

available borrowing capacity under the 7500 million credit facility which is reduced by borrowings and outstanding letters of credit was 5983 million at december 29 2019 

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our expected cash outflows resulting from financial contracts and commitments at december 29 2019 



  

a interest expense related to the credit facility including facility fees is assumed to accrue at the rates in effect at yearend 2019 and is assumed to be paid at the end of each quarter with the final payment in march 2024 when the credit facility expires 

b includes imputed interest and the shortterm portion of lease obligations 

c purchase obligations generally include contractual obligations for the purchase of goods and services and capital commitments that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specifies all significant terms including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased fixed minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the transaction 

unrecognized tax benefits of 245 million are not included in the table above because 106 million is offset by deferred tax assets and the remainder cannot be reasonably estimated to be settled in cash due to a lack of prior settlement history and offsetting credits 

at december 29 2019 we were not required and accordingly are not planning to make any cash contributions to the domestic qualified pension plan for 2020 our minimum funding requirements after 2020 as set forth by erisa are dependent on several factors as discussed under “accounting for pension plans” in the critical accounting policies section of this management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation estimates beyond 2020 have not been provided due to the significant uncertainty of these amounts which are subject to change until the company’s pension assumptions can be updated at the appropriate times in addition certain pension contributions are eligible for future recovery 

through the pricing of products and services to the us government under certain government contracts therefore future cash contributions are not necessarily indicative of the impact these contributions may have on our liquidity we also have payments due under our other postretirement benefit plans these plans are not required to be funded in advance but are pay as you go see further discussion in note 11 of the notes to consolidated financial statements teledyne intends to continue to monitor and manage its defined benefit pension plans obligation and may take additional actions to manage risk in the future 

operating activities 

in 2019 net cash provided by operating activities was 4821 million compared with 4469 million in 2018 and 3747 million in 2017 the higher cash provided by operating activities in 2019 compared with 2018 was driven by higher operating income cash flow from recent acquisitions partially offset by 454 million of higher income tax payments the higher cash provided by operating activities in 2018 compared with 2017 was driven by higher operating income partially offset by 280 million of higher income tax payments 

free cash flow cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures was 3937 million in 2019 compared with 3601 million in 2018 and 3162 million in 2017 



  

a we define free cash flow as cash provided by operating activities a measure prescribed by generally accepted accounting principles less capital expenditures for property plant and equipment the company believes that this supplemental nongaap information is useful to assist management and the investment community in analyzing the company’s ability to generate cash flow 

investing activities 

net cash used in investing activities was 5719 million 886 million and 8312 million for 2019 2018 and 2017 respectively cash flows relating to investing activities consists primarily of cash used for acquisitions and other investments and capital expenditures 



during 2020 we plan to invest approximately 1000 million in capital expenditures principally to upgrade facilities and manufacturing equipment to reduce costs and introduce new products the increase in capital spending in 2018 compared with 2017 primarily reflects facility upgrades and expansions 

acquisitions 

investing activities used cash for acquisitions and other investments of 4840 million 31 million and 7741 million in 2019 2018 and 2017 respectively see “recent acquisitions” teledyne funded the acquisitions primarily from borrowings under its credit facilities issuance of senior notes and term loans and cash on hand on january 3 2020 we acquired oakgate technology inc for 280 million in cash 

for all acquisitions the results of operations and cash flows are included in our consolidated financial statements from the date of each respective acquisition 

the following table shows the purchase price net of cash acquired goodwill acquired and intangible assets acquired for the acquisitions and other investments made in 2019 and 2017 in millions 



the majority of the goodwill resulting from the acquisition of the scientific imaging businesses will be deductible for tax purposes goodwill resulting from the acquisition of the gas and flame detection business and micralyne will not be deductible for tax purposes 



goodwill resulting from the e2v acquisition is not deductible for tax purposes goodwill resulting from the ssi acquisition is deductible for tax purposes 

financing activities 

financing activities for 2019 reflected net proceeds from debt of 1088 million compared with net payments on debt of 3065 million in 2018 and net proceeds from debt of 3937 million for 2017 fiscal years 2019 2018 and 2017 reflect proceeds from the exercise of stock options of 346 million 372 million and 249 million respectively 

other matters 

pension plans 

teledyne has a domestic qualified defined benefit pension plan covering substantially all us employees hired before january 1 2004 or approximately 10 of teledyne’s active employees as of december 29 2019 as of january 1 2004 new us hires participate in a domestic defined contribution plan in 2019 2018 and 2017 teledyne’s domestic pension plan was over 100 funded thus no cash contributions were made for the company’s qualified defined benefit pension plans the discount rate for 2020 will decrease to an average of 341 from 459 in 2019 the company also has several small nonqualified domestic and foreignbased defined benefit pension plans 

income taxes 

our income tax expense deferred tax assets and liabilities and reserves for unrecognized tax benefits reflect management’s best assessment of estimated current and future taxes to be paid we are subject to income taxes in both the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions significant judgments and estimates are required in determining the consolidated income tax expense 

we intend to reinvest indefinitely the earnings of our material foreign subsidiaries in our operations outside of the united states the cash that the company’s foreign subsidiaries hold for indefinite reinvestment is generally used to finance foreign operations and investments including foreign acquisitions we estimate that future domestic cash generation will be sufficient to meet future domestic cash requirements due to the tax act us federal and applicable state income taxes have been accrued for the deemed repatriation at december 29 2019 the amount of undistributed foreign earnings was 3095 million for which we have not recorded a deferred tax liability of approximately 14 million for corporate income taxes which would be due if reinvested foreign earnings were repatriated should we decide to repatriate the foreign earnings we would need to adjust our income tax provision in the period we determined that we would no longer indefinitely reinvest the earnings outside the united states 

deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amount in the financial statements which will result in taxable or deductible amounts in the future in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets within the jurisdiction from which they arise we consider all available positive and negative evidence including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities projected future taxable income taxplanning strategies and results of recent operations in projecting future taxable income we begin with historical results adjusted for the results of discontinued operations and incorporate assumptions about the amount of future state federal and foreign pretax operating income adjusted for items that do not have tax consequences the assumptions about future taxable income require significant judgment and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses in evaluating the objective evidence that historical results provide we consider three years of cumulative operating income based on the company’s history of operating earnings expectations of future operating earnings and potential tax planning strategies management believes that it is possible that some portion of deferred taxes will not be realized as a future tax benefit and therefore has recorded a valuation allowance 

we file income tax returns in the united states federal jurisdiction and in various states and foreign jurisdictions the company has substantially concluded on all us federal income tax matters for all years through 2015 united kingdom income tax matters for all years through 2017 france income tax matters for all years through 2016 and canadian income tax matters for all years through 2011 

costs and pricing 

inflationary trends in recent years have been moderate current inventory costs the increasing costs of equipment and other costs are considered in establishing sales pricing policies the company emphasizes cost containment and cost reductions in all aspects of its business 

hedging activities and market risk disclosures 

teledyne transacts business in various foreign currencies and has international sales and expenses denominated in foreign currencies subjecting the company to foreign currency risk the company’s primary objective is to protect the united states dollar value of future cash flows and minimize the volatility of reported earnings the company utilizes foreign currency forward contracts to reduce the volatility of cash flows primarily related to forecasted revenue and expenses denominated in canadian dollars for our canadian companies and in british pounds for our uk companies these contracts are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges the company has converted us dollar denominated variable rate and fixed rate debt obligations of a european subsidiary into euro fixed rate obligations using a receive float pay fixed cross currency swap and a received fixed pay fixed cross currency swap these cross currency swaps are designated as cash flow hedges in addition the company has converted domestic us variable rate debt to fixed rate debt using a receive variable pay fixed interest rate swap the interest rate swap is also designated as a cash flow hedge 

the effectiveness of the cash flow hedge forward contracts the cross currency swap hedges and the interest rate swap cash flow hedge is assessed prospectively and retrospectively on a monthly basis using regression analysis as well as using other timing and probability criteria to receive hedge accounting treatment all hedging relationships are formally documented at the inception of the hedges and must be highly effective in offsetting changes to future cash flows on hedged transactions the effective portion of the cash flow hedge forward contracts’ gains or losses resulting from changes in the fair value of these hedges is initially reported net of tax as a component of accumulated other comprehensive incomeloss “aoci” in stockholders’ equity until the underlying hedged item is reflected in our consolidated statements of income at which time the effective amount in aoci is reclassified to revenue in our consolidated statements of income for the cross currency swap and interest rate cash flow hedges effective amounts are recorded in aoci and reclassified into interest expense in the consolidated statements of income in addition for the cross currency swaps an amount is reclassified from aoci to other income and expense each reporting period to offset the earnings impact of the remeasurement of the hedged liabilities net deferred gains recorded in aoci net of tax for forward contracts that will mature in the next 12 months total 08 million these gains are expected to be offset by anticipated losses in the value of the forecasted underlying hedged item amounts related to the cross currency swaps and interest rate swap expected to be reclassified from aoci into income in the coming 12 months total 59 million 

in the event that the underlying forecasted transactions do not occur or it becomes remote that they will occur within the defined hedge period the gains or losses on the related cash flow hedges will be reclassified from aoci to other income and expense during the current reporting period all forecasted transactions occurred and therefore there were no such gains or losses reclassified to other income and expense due to missed forecasts 

as of december 29 2019 teledyne had foreign currency forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges to buy canadian dollars and to sell us dollars totaling 757 million these foreign currency forward contracts have maturities ranging from march 2020 to february 2021 teledyne had foreign currency forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges to buy british pounds and to sell us dollars totaling 171 million these foreign currency forward contracts have maturities ranging from march 2020 to february 2021 together these contracts had a negative fair value of 11 million 

the cross currency swaps have notional amounts of €1130 million and 1250 million and €1350 million and 1500 million and mature in march 2023 and october 2024 respectively the interest rate swap has a notional amount of 1250 million and matures in march 2023 

in addition the company utilizes foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate foreign exchange rate risk associated with foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities including intercompany receivables and payables as of december 29 2019 teledyne primarily had foreign currency contracts of this type in the following currency pairs in millions 



these contracts had a negative fair value of 03 million at december 29 2019 the gains and losses on these derivatives which are not designated as hedging instruments are intended to at a minimum partially offset the transaction gains and losses recognized in earnings 

all derivatives are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value as discussed below the accounting for gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value depends on the use of the derivative and whether it is designated and qualifies for hedge accounting teledyne does not use foreign currency forward contracts for speculative or trading purposes 

notwithstanding our efforts to mitigate portions of our foreign currency exchange rate risks there can be no assurance that our hedging activities will adequately protect us against the risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations a hypothetical 10 percent price change of the us dollar from its value at december 29 2019 would result in a decrease or increase in the fair value of our foreign currency forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges to buy canadian dollars and to sell us dollars by approximately 76 million a hypothetical 10 percent price change in the us dollar from its value at december 29 2019 would result in a decrease or increase in the fair value of our foreign currency forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges to buy british pounds and to sell us dollars by approximately 17 million a hypothetical 10 percent price change in the us dollar from its value at december 29 2019 would result in a decrease or increase in the fair value of our eurous dollar cross currency swaps designated as cash flow hedges by approximately 287 million a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in us interest rates at december 29 2019 would result in an increase in the fair value of our us dollar interest rate swap designated as a cash flow hedge by approximately 37 million while a 100 basis point decrease would result in a decrease in its fair value of 35 million 

borrowings under our credit facility are at fixed rates that vary with the term and timing of each loan under the facility loans under the facility typically have terms of one two three or six months and the interest rate for each such loan is subject to change if the loan is continued or converted following the applicable maturity date interest rates are also subject to change based on our debt to earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization ratio as of december 29 2019 we had 1250 million outstanding under our 7500 million credit facility any borrowings under the company’s credit facility are based on a fluctuating market interest rate and consequently the fair value of any outstanding debt should not be affected materially by changes in market interest rates 

our primary exposure to market risk relates to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates we periodically evaluate these risks and have taken measures to mitigate these risks we own assets and operate facilities in countries that have been politically stable 

environmental 

we are subject to various federal state local and international environmental laws and regulations which require that we investigate and remediate the effects of the release or disposal of materials at sites associated with past and present operations these include sites at which teledyne has been identified as a potentially responsible party under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act commonly known as superfund and comparable state laws we are currently involved in the investigation and remediation of a number of sites reserves for environmental investigation and remediation totaled 60 million at both december 29 2019 and december 30 2018 as investigation and remediation of these sites proceed and new information is received the company will adjust accruals to reflect new information based on current information we do not believe that future environmental costs in excess of those already accrued will materially and adversely affect our financial condition or liquidity see also our environmental risk factor disclosure beginning on page 24 and notes 2 and 14 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

government contracts 

we perform work on a number of contracts with the us department of defense and other agencies and departments of the us government including subcontracts with government prime contractors sales under these contracts with the us government which included contracts with the us department of defense were approximately 24 of total net sales in 2019 23 of total net sales in 2018 and 24 of total sales in 2017 for a summary of sales to the us government by segment see note 12 of the notes to consolidated financial statements sales to the us department of defense represented approximately 17 17 and 18 of total net sales for 2019 2018 and 2017 respectively 

performance under government contracts has certain inherent risks that could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business results of operations and financial condition government contracts are conditioned upon the continuing availability of congressional appropriations which usually occurs on a fiscal year basis even though contract performance may take more than one year see also our government contracts risks factor disclosure beginning on page 18 

for information on accounts receivable from the us government see note 5 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

estimates and reserves 

our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent liabilities on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including those related to product returns and replacements allowance for doubtful accounts inventories intangible assets income taxes warranty obligations pension and other postretirement benefits longterm contracts environmental workers’ compensation and general liability employee benefits and other contingencies and litigation we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances at the time the results of which form the basis for making our judgments actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions in some cases such differences may be material see also critical accounting policies 

the following table reflects significant reserves and valuation accounts which are estimates and based on judgments as described above at december 29 2019 and december 30 2018 



  

a this table should be read in conjunction with the notes to consolidated financial statements 

b includes both longterm and shortterm reserves 

some of the company’s products are subject to standard warranties and the company provides for the estimated cost of product warranties we regularly assess the adequacy of our preexisting warranty liabilities and adjust amounts as necessary based on a review of historic warranty experience with respect to the applicable business or products as well as the length and actual terms of the warranties which are typically one year the product warranty reserve is included in current accrued liabilities and other longterm liabilities on the balance sheet 



critical accounting policies 

the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with united states generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the notes to the financial statements some of those judgments can be subjective and complex and therefore actual results could differ materially from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions our critical accounting policies are those that are reflective of significant judgment complexity and uncertainty and may potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions we have identified the following as critical accounting policies revenue recognition accounting for pension plans accounting for business combinations goodwill and acquired intangible assets and accounting for income taxes for additional discussion of the application of these and other accounting policies see note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition 

approximately 40 of our revenue is recognized over time with the remaining 60 of our revenue recognized at a point in time 

revenue recognized over time relates primarily to contracts to design develop andor manufacture highly engineered products used in both defense and commercial applications the transaction price in these arrangements may include estimated amounts of variable consideration including award fees incentive fees contract amounts not yet funded or other provisions that can either increase or decrease the transaction price we estimate variable consideration at the amount to which we expect to be entitled and we include estimated amounts in the transaction price to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the estimation uncertainty is resolved the estimation of this variable consideration and determination of whether to include estimated amounts in the transaction price are based largely on an assessment of our anticipated performance and all information historical current and forecasted that is reasonably available to us as control transfers continuously over time on these contracts revenue is recognized based on the extent of progress towards completion of the performance obligation the selection of the method to measure progress towards completion requires judgment and is based on the nature of the products or services to be provided we generally use the costtocost measure of progress as this measure best depicts the transfer of control to the customer which occurs as we incur costs on our contracts under the costtocost method the extent of progress towards completion is measured based on the ratio of costs incurred to date to the total estimated costs at completion of the performance obligation 

for over time contracts using costtocost we have an estimate at completion “eac” process in which management reviews the progress and execution of our performance obligations this eac process requires management judgment relative to assessing risks estimating contract revenue determining reasonably dependable cost estimates and making assumptions for schedule and technical issues since certain contracts extend over a longer period of time the impact of revisions in cost and revenue estimates during the progress of work may adjust the current period earnings through a cumulative catchup basis this method recognizes in the current period the cumulative effect of the changes on current and prior quarters additionally if the current contract estimate indicates a loss a provision is made for the total anticipated loss in the period that it becomes evident contract cost and revenue estimates for significant contracts are generally reviewed and reassessed quarterly 

we do not believe that any discrete event or adjustment to an individual contract within the aggregate changes in contract estimates for 2019 2018 or 2017 was material to the consolidated statements of income for such annual periods 

revenue recognized at a point in time relates primarily to the sale of standard or minimally customized products with control transferring to the customer generally upon the transfer of title see note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional revenue recognition disclosures 

pension plans 

the company’s accounting for its defined benefit pension plans requires that amounts recognized in financial statements be determined on an actuarial basis rather than as contributions are made to the plan in consultation with our actuaries we determine the appropriate assumptions for use in determining the liability for future pension benefits net actuarial gains or losses are amortized to expense on a planbyplan basis when they exceed the accounting corridor the accounting corridor is a defined range within which amortization of net gains and losses is not required and is equal to 10 percent of the greater of the market related value of assets or benefit obligations gains or losses outside of the corridor are subject to amortization over our average employee future service period of approximately nine years significant assumptions used in determining the company’s pension income or expense is the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets participant mortality estimates expected rates of increase in future compensation levels employee turnover as well as the assumed discount rate on pension obligations 

differences in the discount rate and expected longterm rate of return on assets within the indicated range would have had the following impact on 2019 pension expense in millions 



see note 11 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional pension disclosures 

business combinations goodwill and acquired intangible assets 

the results for all acquisitions are included in the company’s consolidated financial statements from the date of each respective acquisition business acquisitions are accounted for under the acquisition method by assigning the purchase price to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at their fair values and the excess of the purchase price over the amounts assigned is recorded as goodwill we determine the fair value of such assets and liabilities often in consultation with thirdparty valuation advisors acquired intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives adjustments to fair value assessments are recorded to goodwill over the purchase price allocation period 

goodwill and acquired intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized we review goodwill and acquired indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable the company also performs an annual impairment test in the fourth quarter of each year we test goodwill and acquired indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment between annual tests if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce our enterprise fair value below its book value these events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate including a significant sustained decline in an entity’s market value legal factors operating performance indicators competition sale or disposition of a significant portion of the business or other factors 

we may use either a qualitative or quantitative approach when testing a reporting unit’s goodwill for impairment for selected reporting units where we use the qualitative approach we perform a qualitative evaluation of events and circumstances impacting the reporting unit to determine the likelihood of goodwill impairment based on that qualitative evaluation if we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount no further evaluation is necessary otherwise we perform a quantitative impairment test we perform a quantitative test for each reporting unit at least once every three years 

for goodwill impairment testing using the quantitative approach the company estimates the fair value of the selected reporting units primarily through the use of a discounted cash flow model based on our best estimate of amounts and timing of future revenues and cash flows and our most recent business and strategic plans and compares the estimated fair value to the carrying value of the reporting unit including goodwill the discounted cash flow model requires judgmental assumptions about projected revenue growth future operating margins discount rates and terminal values over a multiyear period there are inherent uncertainties related to these assumptions and management’s judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill impairment while the company believes it has made reasonable estimates and assumptions to calculate the fair value of its reporting units it is possible a material change could occur if actual results are not consistent with management’s estimates and assumptions goodwill may be overstated and a charge would need to be taken against net earnings 

changes in our projections used in the discounted cash flow model could affect the estimated fair value of certain of the company’s reporting units and could result in a goodwill impairment charge in a future period in order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations used in the quantitative goodwill impairment test the company applied a hypothetical 10 decrease to the fair values of each reporting unit subject to a quantitative impairment test and compared those values to the reporting unit carrying values based on this sensitivity analysis the company did not identify any goodwill impairment due to the many variables inherent in the estimation of a reporting unit’s fair value and the relative size of our recorded goodwill differences in assumptions may have a material effect on the results of our impairment analysis 

as of december 29 2019 the company had nine reporting units for goodwill impairment testing the carrying value of goodwill included in the company’s individual reporting units ranged from 12 million to 8702 million the company’s analysis in 2019 indicated that in all instances the fair value of the company’s reporting units exceeded their carrying values and consequently did not result in an impairment charge the excess of the estimated fair value over the carrying value expressed as a percentage of carrying value of the respective reporting unit for the company’s reporting units subject to a quantitative test as of the fourth quarter of 2019 the annual testing date exceeded at least 77 

income taxes 

income tax expense and deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect management’s assessment of actual future taxes to be paid on items reflected in the financial statements significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes uncertainty exists regarding tax positions taken in previously filed tax returns still under examination and positions expected to be taken in the current year and future returns deferred tax assets and liabilities arise due to differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and tax carryforwards although we believe our income tax expense and deferred tax assets and liabilities are reasonable no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome will not be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals to the extent that the final tax outcome is different than the amounts recorded such differences will impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made the provision for income taxes includes the impact of uncertain tax benefits that are considered appropriate as well as the related net interest 

significant judgment is required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets in assessing the need for a valuation allowance we consider all available evidence including past operating results estimates of future taxable income and the feasibility of tax planning strategies in the event that we change our determination as to the amount of deferred tax assets that can be realized we will adjust our valuation allowance with a corresponding impact to the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made 

an increase of 100 basis points in our nominal tax rate would have resulted in additional income tax provision for the fiscal year ended december 29 2019 of 47 million for a description of the company’s tax accounting policies refer to note 2 and note 10 of the notes to consolidated financial statements

changes in the policies of us and foreign governments including economic sanctions could result over time in reductions or realignment in defense or other government spending and further changes in programs in which the company participates 

while teledyne’s growth strategy includes possible acquisitions we cannot provide any assurance as to when if or on what terms any acquisitions will be made acquisitions involve various inherent risks such as among others our ability to integrate acquired businesses retain customers and achieve identified financial and operating synergies there are additional risks associated with acquiring owning and operating businesses outside of the united states including those arising from us and foreign government policy changes or actions and exchange rate fluctuations 

we continue to take action to assure compliance with the internal controls disclosure controls and other requirements of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 while we believe our control systems are effective there are inherent limitations in all control systems and misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and may not be detected

customers 

we have a large number of customers in the various industries we serve no commercial customer accounted for more than 10 of any segment net sales during 2018  2017  or 2016  no commercial customer in 2018 2017 or 2016 accounted for more than 30  of total net sales 

sales to international customers accounted for approximately 47  of total sales in 2018  compared with 46  in 2017  and 43  in 2016  in 2018  we sold products to customers in over 100 foreign countries approximately 90 of our sales to foreignbased customers were made to customers in 25 foreign countries in 2018  the top five countries for international sales were china  germany  the united kingdom  japan  and south korea  and constituted approximately 21  of our total sales 

approximately 23  24  and 27  of our total net sales for 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively were derived from contracts with agencies of and prime contractors to the us government information on our sales to the us government including direct sales as a prime contractor and indirect sales as a subcontractor is as follows in millions 



our principal us government customer is the us department of defense these sales represented 17  18  and 21  of our total net sales for 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively in 2018 our largest program with the us government was the osf program with the missile defense agency “agency” which represented 16 of our total net sales for 2018 the osf followon program which was not awarded to teledyne in november 2018 has been put on hold pending an investigation by the agency and in the meantime teledyne’s performance under the osf contract continues in both 2017 and 2016 our largest program with the us government was the mission operations and integration contract with the nasa marshall space flight center which represented 15 of our total net sales in both years 

as described under risk factors there are risks associated with doing business with the us government in 2018  approximately 67  of our us government prime contracts and subcontracts were fixedprice type contracts compared to 58  in 2017  and 54  in 2016  under these types of contracts we bear the inherent risk that actual performance cost may exceed the fixed contract price such contracts are typically not subject to renegotiation of profits if we fail to anticipate technical problems estimate costs accurately or control costs during performance additionally us government contracts are subject to termination by the us government at its convenience without identification of any default when contracts are terminated for convenience we recover costs incurred or committed settlement expenses and profit on work completed prior to termination we had 15  us government contracts terminated for convenience in 2018  compared with nine  in 2017  and one  in 2016  

our total backlog of confirmed and funded orders was approximately 15688 million  at december 30 2018  compared with 12502 million  at december 31 2017  and 9164 million  at january 1 2017  we expect to fulfill a majority of such backlog of confirmed orders during 2019 

seasonality 

no material portion of our business is considered to be seasonal 

raw materials and suppliers 

generally our businesses have experienced minimal fluctuations in the supply of raw materials but not without some price volatility while some of our businesses provide services for those businesses that sell hardware and product a portion of the value that we provide is labororiented such as design engineering assembly and test activities in manufacturing our products we use our own production capabilities and also third party suppliers and subcontractors including international sources some of the items we use for the manufacture of our products including certain gyro components for some marine navigation applications certain magnets and helix wire for our traveling wave tubes certain infrared detectors substrates and certain ceramics and molding compounds used in our sonar systems as well as certain scintillator materials used in the production of our xray detectors are purchased from limited or single sources including international sources due to technical capability price and other factors at times we have experienced difficulty in procuring raw materials components subassemblies and other supplies required in our manufacturing processes due to shortages and supplier imposed allocation of components 

sales and marketing 

our sales and marketing approach varies by segment and by products within our segments a shared fundamental tenet is the commitment to work closely with our customers to understand their needs with an aim to secure preferred supplier and longerterm relationships 

our segments use a combination of internal sales forces thirdparty distributors and commissioned sales representatives to market and sell our products and services our businesses have been working over the years to consolidate or share internal sales and servicing efforts several teledyne businesses have been marketing and selling products collaboratively to similar customers to promote “onestop” shopping under singular “brand” names including teledyne marine teledyne oil  gas teledyne water quality teledyne microwave solutions teledyne hirel electronics and teledyne advanced chemistry systems 

products are also advertised in appropriate trade journals and by means of various websites to promote our products and other capabilities our personnel regularly participate in relevant trade shows and professional associations 

many of our government contracts are awarded after a competitive bidding process in which we seek to emphasize our ability to provide superior products and technical solutions in addition to competitive pricing 

through teledyne technologies international corp and other subsidiaries we have established offices in foreign countries to facilitate international sales for various businesses locations include brazil china france germany italy japan malaysia singapore south korea and the united arab emirates 

competition 

we believe that technological capabilities and innovation and the ability to invest in the development of new and enhanced products are critical to obtaining and maintaining leadership in our markets and the industries in which we compete although we have certain advantages that we believe help us compete effectively in our markets each of our markets is highly competitive with regard to our defense businesses it is common in the defense industry for work on programs to be shared among a number of companies including competitors in any event because of the diversity of products sold and the number of markets we serve we encounter a wide variety of competitors none of which we believe offer all of the same product and service lines or serve all of the same markets as we do our businesses vigorously compete on the basis of quality product performance and reliability technical expertise price and service many of our competitors have and potential competitors could have greater name recognition a larger installed base of products more extensive engineering manufacturing marketing and distribution capabilities and greater financial technological and personnel resources than we do 

intellectual property 

while we own and control various intellectual property rights including patents trade secrets confidential information trademarks trade names and copyrights which in the aggregate are of material importance to our business we believe that our business as a whole is not materially dependent upon any one intellectual property or related group of such properties we own several hundred active patents and are licensed to use certain patents technology and other intellectual property rights owned and controlled by others similarly other companies are licensed to use certain patents technology and other intellectual property rights owned and controlled by us 

patents patent applications and license agreements will expire or terminate over time by operation of law in accordance with their terms or otherwise we do not expect the expiration or termination of these patents patent applications and license agreements to have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition

risk factors cautionary statement as to forwardlooking statements 

the following text highlights various risks and uncertainties associated with teledyne these factors could materially affect “forwardlooking statements” within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 that we may make from time to time including forwardlooking statements contained in “item 1 business” and “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” of this form 10k and in teledyne’s 2018  annual report to stockholders it is not possible for management to predict all such factors and new factors may emerge or existing factors diverge additionally management cannot assess the impact of each such factor on teledyne or the extent to which any factor or combination of factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forwardlooking statements 

  

a new global recession or an economic downturn in china may adversely affect us 

if another global recession emerges if economic uncertainty in europe continues or worsens or if economic growth in china substantially slows we may experience declines in revenues profitability and cash flows from reduced orders payment delays collection difficulties increased price pressures for our products increased risk of excess and obsolete inventories or other factors caused by the economic problems of customers our sales to chinabased customers represented 67 of total revenues in 2018 63 of total revenue in 2017 and 57 of total revenue in 2016 in recent months economic growth in china has moderated continued growth in many of our businesses including those in the environmental and electronic measurement instrumentation group and our commercial aviationrelated business units could be negatively impacted if this trend proves to be longlasting or systematic rather than cyclical in nature if negative conditions in the global credit markets prevent our customers’ access to credit or render them insolvent orders for our products may decrease which would result in lower revenue likewise if our suppliers face challenges in obtaining credit in selling their products or otherwise in operating their businesses or remaining solvent they may become unable to offer the materials we use to manufacture our products these events could adversely impact our ability to manufacture affected products and could also result in reductions in our revenue increased price competition and increased operating costs which could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we develop and manufacture products for customers in the energy exploration and production markets domestic and international commercial aerospace markets the semiconductor industry the consumer electronics telecommunications and 

automotive industries each of which has been cyclical exhibited rapid changes and suffered from fluctuating market demands a cyclical downturn in these markets may materially affect future operating results 

in addition we sell products and services to customers in industries that are sensitive to the level of general economic activity and consumer spending habits and in more mature industries that are sensitive to capacity adverse economic conditions affecting these industries may reduce demand for our products and services which may reduce our revenues profits or production levels some of our businesses serve industries such as power generation and petrochemical refining which may be negatively impacted in the event of future reductions in global capital expenditures and manufacturing capacity 

escalating trade tensions and the adoption or expansion of tariffs and trade restrictions could negatively impact us 

the us government has recently announced tariffs on steel and aluminum products and materials imported into the united states the us government has also implemented or announced plans to impose tariffs on a widerange of goods imported from china various countries and economic regions have announced plans or intentions to impose retaliatory tariffs on a widerange of products they import from the us these newly imposed or threatened us tariffs and retaliatory tariffs could have the effect of increasing the cost of materials for our products which could result in our products becoming less competitive or generating lower margins sales to customers in china are particularly important for businesses in our environmental and electronic measurement instrumentation group the tariffs could also result in disruptions to our supply chain as suppliers struggle to fill orders from companies trying to purchase goods in bulk ahead of announced tariffs we may also need to find new suppliers and components for our products which could result in production delays to the extent our products are the subject of retaliatory tariffs customers in some countries or regions such as china may begin to seek domestic or nonus sources for products that we sell or be pressured or incentivized by foreign governments not to purchase usorigin goods which could harm our future sales in these markets 

a material amount of our total revenues is derived from companies in the oil and gas industry especially the offshore oil and gas industry a historically cyclical industry with levels of activity that are significantly affected by the levels and volatility of oil and gas prices 

a material amount of our total revenues is derived from customers in or connected to the oil and gas exploration development and production especially the offshore oil and gas industry the oil and gas industry is a historically cyclical industry characterized by significant changes in the levels of exploration and development activities oil and gas prices and market expectations of potential changes in those prices significantly affect the levels of those activities any prolonged reduction in the overall level of offshore oil and gas exploration and development activities whether resulting from changes in oil and gas prices or otherwise could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations of our businesses within our instrumentation segment 

some factors that have affected and are likely to continue affecting oil and gas prices and the level of demand for our services and products include the following 

 

teledyne manufactures seismic sources interconnects and data acquisition products used in offshore energy exploration when crude oil and natural gas prices are low the level of marine seismic exploration activity typically decreases potentially resulting in reduced demand for our products used in offshore energy exploration in addition a decline in the level of capital spending by oil and natural gas companies may result in a reduced pace of development of new energy reserves which could adversely affect demand for our products related to energy production and in certain instances result in the cancellation modification or rescheduling of existing orders and a reduction in customerfunded research and development related to next generation products 

our indebtedness and any failure to comply with our covenants that apply to our indebtedness could materially and adversely affect our business 

as of december 30 2018  we had 7488 million  in total outstanding indebtedness this indebtedness included 3250 million  in senior unsecured fixed rate notes 2860 million  in euro denominated fixed rate notes 1000 million  in term loans and 290 million  outstanding under our 7500 million  floating rate credit facility our indebtedness could harm our business by among other things reducing the funds available to make acquisitions capital expenditures stock repurchases or reducing our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and market conditions our indebtedness exposes us to interest rate risk since a portion of our debt obligations are at variable rates our indebtedness could also have a material adverse effect on our business by increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions or a downturn in our business general adverse economic and industry conditions or a downturn in our business could result in our inability to repay this indebtedness in a timely manner 

further in july 2017 the financial conduct authority the authority that regulates libor announced it intends to stop compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of libor after 2021 the alternative reference rates committee “arrc” has proposed that the secured overnight financing rate sofr is the rate that represents best practice as the alternative to usdlibor for use in debt instruments derivatives and other financial contracts that are currently indexed to usdlibor arrc has proposed a paced market transition plan to sofr from usdlibor and organizations are currently working on industry wide and company specific transition plans as it relates to derivatives debt and cash markets exposed to usdlibor it is unclear as to the new method of calculating libor that may evolve and this new method could adversely affect the company’s interest rates on its indebtedness the company is monitoring the arrc transition plan and is evaluating potential related risks as of december 30 2018 approximately four percent of the company’s longterm debt is variable and can be indexed to usdlibor the company expects to amend the 7500 million credit facility in the first quarter of 2019 in order to extend the maturity date from december 2020 to march 2024 in anticipation of the expected elimination of libor in 2021 this credit facility amendment will include the procedure to switch to libor alternative replacement rates in the future 

we are subject to the risks associated with international sales and international operations which could harm our business or results of operations 

during 2018  sales to international customers accounted for approximately 47  of our total revenues compared with 46  in 2017  and 43  in 2016  in 2018  we sold products to customers in over 100 countries in 2018  the top five countries for international sales were china  germany  the united kingdom  japan  and south korea  constituting approximately 21  of our total sales we anticipate that future sales to international customers will continue to account for a significant and increasing percentage of our revenues particularly since business and growth plans for many teledyne businesses focus on sales outside of the united states including to emerging markets such as china brazil and west africa 

risks associated with international sales include but are not limited to 

 any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition exchange rate fluctuations may negatively affect the cost of our products to international customers and therefore reduce our competitive position 

in june 2016 the united kingdom “uk” held a referendum in which voters approved an exit from the european union “eu” commonly referred to as “brexit” the uk is currently scheduled to leave the eu on may 29 2019 unless this date is extended to date there has been no agreement between the eu and the uk on the terms of the exit the announcement of brexit caused significant volatility in global stock markets and currency exchange rate fluctuations that resulted in the strengthening of the us dollar against foreign currencies in which we conduct business the announcement of brexit and subsequent highprofile failures of the uk to agree on an exit strategy and the pending withdrawal of the uk 

from the eu may also create further global economic uncertainty which may adversely impact the economies of the uk the eu countries and other nations may cause our current and future customers to reduce their spending on our products and services and may cause certain eubased customers to source products from businesses based outside of the uk for example brexitrelated uncertainty could lead to a reconsideration by airbus as to future investment and spending in the uk which could reduce sales for our ukbased businesses that supply airbus potential brexitrelated risks for our ukbased businesses also include increased import duties loss of customers in the eu delays in the movement of goods between the uk and the eu and loss of access to the eu labor pool given our several ukbased businesses volatility in the value of the british pound relative to the us dollar or other foreign currencies could increase the cost of raw materials and components for our ukbased businesses and could otherwise adversely affect the business operations and the financial condition of our ukbased businesses 

acquisitions involve inherent risks that may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

our growth strategy includes acquisitions acquisitions involve various inherent risks such as 

 while we conduct financial and other due diligence in connection with our acquisitions and generally seek some form of protection including indemnification from a seller and sometimes an escrow of a portion of the purchase price to cover potential issues such acquired companies may have weaknesses or liabilities that are not accurately assessed or brought to our attention at the time of the acquisition further indemnities or escrows may not fully cover such matters particularly matters identified after a closing 

in connection with our acquisitions including ones which we do not complete we may incur significant transaction costs we are required to expense as incurred such transaction costs which may have a material adverse impact on our financial results 

changes in future business conditions could cause business investments goodwill and other longlived assets to become impaired resulting in significant losses and writedowns that would reduce our operating income 

on december 30 2018  teledyne’s goodwill was 17352 million  and net acquired intangible assets were 3443 million  under current accounting guidance we are required to test annually both acquired goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment based upon a fair value approach rather than amortizing them over time we have chosen to perform our annual impairment reviews of goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year we also are required to test goodwill for impairment between annual tests if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce our enterprise fair value below its book value these events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate including a significant sustained decline in an entity’s market value legal factors operating performance indicators competition sale or disposition of a significant portion of the business or other factors if the fair market value is less than the carrying value including goodwill we could be required to record an impairment charge the valuation of reporting units requires judgment in estimating future cash flows discount rates and estimated product life cycles in making these judgments we evaluate the financial health of the business including such factors as industry performance changes in technology and operating cash flows as we have grown through acquisitions the amount of goodwill and net acquired intangible assets is a significant portion of our total assets as a result the amount of any annual or interim impairment could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our reported financial results for 

the period in which the charge is taken we also may be required to record an earnings charge or incur unanticipated expenses if as a result of a change in strategy or other reason we were to determine the value of other assets had been impaired 

united states and global responses to terrorism concerns regarding nuclear proliferation and the safety of nuclear energy continuing turmoil in middle eastern countries increasing tension between the us and russia and china potential epidemics potential future financial issues impacting airlines and volatile energy prices increase uncertainties with respect to many of our businesses and may adversely affect our business and results of operations 

united states’ and global responses to terrorism continuing turmoil in middle eastern countries and nuclear proliferation concerns increase uncertainties with respect to us and other business and financial markets and could adversely affect our business and operations increasing tensions with russia as well as china could disrupt the global economic recovery 

air travel declines have occurred after terrorist attacks and heightened security alerts as well as after the highprofile outbreaks of disease additional declines in air travel resulting from such factors and other factors could adversely affect the financial condition of many of our commercial airline and aircraft manufacturer customers and in turn could adversely affect our aerospace and defense electronics segment in addition a prolonged virus epidemic or pandemic or the threat thereof could result in worker absences lower productivity voluntary closure of our offices and manufacturing facilities disruptions in our supply chain travel restrictions on our employees and other disruptions to our businesses moreover health epidemics may force local health and government authorities to mandate the temporary closure of our offices and manufacturing facilities 

higher oil prices could adversely affect commercial airlinerelated customers of our aerospace and defense electronics segment conversely lower oil prices have decreased oil exploration and petrochemical refining activities and have hindered our marine and other instrumentation businesses in addition instability in the middle east or other oilproducing regions could adversely affect expansion plans of the oil and gas industry customers of our instrumentation and cable solutions businesses 

our revenue from government contracts subjects us to many risks 

our revenue from us government contracts depends on the continued availability of funding from the us government and accordingly we have the risk that funding for our existing contracts may be canceled or diverted to other uses or delayed 

we perform work on a number of contracts with the us department of defense and other agencies and departments of the us government including subcontracts with government prime contractors sales under contracts with the us government as a whole including sales under contracts with the us department of defense as prime contractor or subcontractor represented approximately 23  of our total revenue in 2018  compared with 24  in 2017  and 27  in 2016  performance under government contracts has inherent risks that could have a material effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

government contracts are conditioned upon the continuing availability of congressional appropriations and the failure of congress to appropriate funds for programs in which we participate could negatively affect our results of operations the partial us government shutdown that began in december 2018 resulted in delays in anticipated contract awards and delayed payments of invoices for several of our businesses the us government shutdown in 2013 negatively affected many of our businesses as did prior shutdowns of the us government and any new shutdown could have similar or worse effects the failure by congress to approve future budgets on a timely basis could delay procurement of our products and services and cause us to lose future revenues any renewed emphasis on federal deficit and debt reduction could lead to a further decrease in overall defense spending budgetary concerns could result in future contracts being awarded more on price than on other competitive factors and smaller defense budgets could result in government insourcing of programs and more intense competition on programs that are not insourced which could result in lower revenues and profits 

although the us president has indicated his desire for increased defense spending continued defense spending does not necessarily correlate to continued business for us because not all of the programs in which we participate or have current capabilities may be provided with continued funding changes in policy and budget priorities by the president his administration and the us congress for various defense and nasa programs could continue to impact our engineered systems aerospace and defense electronics and digital imaging segments for example changes in national space policy that affect nasa’s budget have occurred there have also been significant reductions in the past in missile defense budgets our aerospace and defense electronics segment may be impacted by volume andor price reductions in connection with the f34 joint strike fighter program to the extent they are imposed the timing of program cycles can affect our results of operations for a particular quarter or year and cancellations of significant programs such as the objective simulation framework “osf” littoral combat ship gun mission modules or the shallow water combat submersible “swcs” would affect our results it is also not uncommon for the us department of defense to delay the timing of awards for major programs for six to twelve months reductions and delays in research and development funding by the us government may continue to impact our revenues uncertainty over budgets or priorities with the presidential administration could result in delays in funding changes 

in funded programs and the timing of awards that could have a material impact on our revenues finally various us department of defense initiatives such as the emphasis on insourcing positions to the government and anticipated reductions or cancellations of existing programs could negatively impact our engineered systems segment 

our participation in government programs may decrease or be subject to renegotiation as those programs evolve over time 

the us government has been placing emphasis on small business quotas and increasing small business contract set asides and minimum work percentages in some cases prime contractors are required to reduce participation by large subcontractors like teledyne in order to fill small business quotas and be responsive to proposals and bids as a result our engineered systems segment could be significantly impacted 

over time and for a variety of reasons programs can evolve and affect the extent of our participation we have been a significant participant in nasa programs primarily through our engineered systems segment and through teledyne scientific company the prior us presidential administration introduced significant changes to the national space policy including the cancellation of the nasa’s constellation program which includes ares launch vehicles delayed funding and changes in support for nasa’s current space policy could negatively impact our business the presidential administration could also lead to changes to the nation’s space policy some or all of which could materially impact our results 

our contracts with the us government are subject to termination rights that could adversely affect us 

most of our us government contracts are subject to termination by the us government either at its convenience or upon the default of the contractor termination for convenience provisions provide only for the recovery of costs incurred or committed settlement expenses and profit on work completed prior to termination termination for default clauses impose liability on the contractor for excess costs incurred by the us government in reprocuring undelivered items from another source we had 15 us government contracts terminated for convenience in 2018  compared with nine  in 2017  and one  in 2016  no contracts were terminated for default during such threeyear period 

we may lose money or generate less than expected profits on our fixedprice and other government contracts and we may lose money if we fail to meet certain prespecified targets in government contracts 

there is no guarantee that us government contracts will be profitable a number of our us government prime contracts and subcontracts are fixedprice type contracts  67  of our total us government contracts were fixedprice in 2018  58  in 2017  and 54  in 2016  under these types of contracts we bear the inherent risk that actual performance cost may exceed the fixed contract price under such contracts we must absorb cost overruns notwithstanding the difficulty of estimating all of the costs we will incur in performing these contracts we cannot assure that our contract loss provisions in our financial statements will be adequate to cover all actual future losses we may lose money or generate lower profits on some contracts if we fail to meet these estimates we may also lose money on nonfixed price costreimbursement contracts that contain disincentives or penalties related to cost schedule or performance 

our business is subject to government contracting regulations including increasingly complex regulations on cybersecurity and our failure to comply with such laws and regulations could harm our operating results and prospects 

we like other government contractors are subject to various audits reviews and investigations including private party “whistleblower” lawsuits relating to our compliance with federal and state laws more routinely the us government may audit the costs we incur on our us government contracts including allocated indirect costs such audits could result in adjustments to our contract costs any costs found to be improperly allocated to a specific contract will not be reimbursed and such costs already reimbursed would need to be refunded we have recorded contract revenues based upon costs we expect to realize on final audit in a worst case scenario should a business or division involved be charged with wrongdoing or should the us government determine that the business or division is not a “presently responsible contractor” that business or division and conceivably our company as a whole could be temporarily suspended or in the event of a conviction could be debarred for up to three years from receiving new government contracts or governmentapproved subcontracts in addition we could expend substantial amounts defending against such charges and in damages fines and penalties if such charges were proven or were to result in negotiated settlements the department of defense as well as other us government contracting agencies have adopted new rules and regulations requiring contractors to implement a set of cyber security measures to attain the safeguarding of contractor systems that process store or transmit certain information implementation and compliance with these new cyber security requirements is complex and costly and could result in unforeseen expenses lower profitability and in the case of noncompliance penalties and damages all of which could have an adverse effect on our business 

our pension expense and the value of our pension assets are affected by factors outside of our control including the performance of plan assets the stock market interest rates and actuarial experience 

we have a domestic qualified defined benefit pension plan covering most of our us employees hired prior to 2004 or approximately 12  of our active employees we also have several small domestic nonqualified and foreignbased pension plans as of december 30 2018 the value of the combined pension assets is greater than our combined pension benefit obligations the accounting rules applicable to our pension plans require that amounts recognized in the financial statements be determined on an actuarial basis rather than as contributions are made to the plan two significant elements in determining our pension income or pension expense are the expected return on plan assets and the discount rate used in projecting pension benefit obligations declines in the stock market and lower rates of return could increase required contributions to our qualified pension plan andor result in a change to shareholders’ equity our investment strategy may not produce the expected returns if the credit financial or stock markets deteriorate any decreases or increases in market interest rates will affect the discount rate assumption used in projecting pension benefit obligations in addition changes in other actuarial assumptions such as mortality assumptions or change due to legislative or regulatory actions could impact our pension income or expense as well as funding obligations each year beginning with 2014 the society of actuaries released revised mortality tables which updated life expectancy assumptions in consideration of these tables each year we review the mortality assumptions used in determining our pension and postretirement benefit obligations the impact of these mortality assumptions could increase our pension obligation and increase future pension expense in 2013 we made a voluntary pretax cash contribution of 830 million  to the domestic qualified pension plan no contributions were made to the domestic qualified pension plan since the 2013 contribution if and to the extent decreases in our pension assets are not offset by voluntary contributions recovered through future asset returns mitigated by an increase in the rate at which the benefit obligation is discounted or other actions our required cash contributions and pension expense could increase under the plans in addition we have sold approximately 639 million in pension liability to third parties in recent years to the extent any of these counterparties are unable to fulfill their obligations to retirees we may have residual liability particularly to the extent state guarantee funds are inadequate for additional discussion of pension matters see the discussion under “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition” and notes 2 and 11 to our notes to consolidated financial statements 

our business and operations could suffer in the event of cyber security breaches 

attempts by others to gain unauthorized access to our information technology systems have become more sophisticated and are sometimes successful these attempts which might be related to industrial or foreign government espionage activism or other motivations include covertly introducing malware to our computers and networks performing reconnaissance impersonating authorized users stealing corrupting or restricting our access to data among other activities we continue to train our personnel and update our infrastructure security tools and processes to protect against security incidents including both external and internal threats and to prevent their recurrence company personnel and third parties have been tasked to detect and investigate such incidents but it is possible that we might not prevent or be aware of an incident or its magnitude and effects the theft corruption unauthorized use or publication of our intellectual property andor confidential business information could harm our competitive position reduce the value of our investment in research and development and other strategic initiatives or otherwise adversely affect our business we are subject to us department of defense regulations applicable to certain types of data residing on or transiting through certain information systems and we expect these regulations will be incorporated into certain contracts we hold to the extent that any security breach results in inappropriate disclosure of confidential or controlled information of employees third parties or the us government or any of the deployed security controls are deemed insufficient we may incur liability or the loss of contracts or security clearances as a result in addition we expect to continue devoting additional resources to the security of our information technology systems more resources may be required in the defense arena to the extent the us government increases its cyber security mandates unauthorized access to or control of our products devices or systems could impact the safely or our customers and other third parties which could result in legal claims against us security breaches also could result in a violation of applicable us and international privacy and other laws including the gdpr and subject us to private consumer or securities litigation and governmental investigations and proceedings any of which could result in our exposure to material civil or criminal liability 

we may not have sufficient resources to fund all future research and development and capital expenditures or possible acquisitions 

in order to remain competitive we must make substantial investments in research and development of new or enhanced products and continuously upgrade our process technology and manufacturing capabilities our research and development efforts primarily involve engineering and design related to improving existing products and developing new products and technologies in the same or similar fields our teledyne scientific company subsidiary which serves as our primary research center has been actively promoting and funding joint research and development projects with other teledyne businesses including our teledyne oil  gas teledyne defense electronics and teledyne digital imaging and test and measurement businesses the business of e2v for which the design and development of specialized technology for high performance systems and equipment is integral also requires substantial investments in research and development additionally some of our businesses are actively pursuing governmental support and funding for some of their research and development initiatives 

including dalsa with respect to its cmos and uncooled infrared image sensor development efforts as well as the expansion of dalsa’s semiconductor foundry in bromont quebec nonetheless we may be unable to fund all of our research and development and capital investment needs or possible acquisitions our ability to raise additional capital will depend on a variety of factors some of which will not be within our control including the existence of bank and capital markets investor perceptions of us our businesses and the industries in which we operate and general economic conditions failure to successfully raise needed capital or generate cash flow on a timely or costeffective basis could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition in addition if we fail to accurately predict future customer needs and preferences or fail to produce viable technologies we may invest heavily in research and development of products that do not lead to significant revenue which would adversely affect our profitability 

limitations in customer funding for applied research and development and technology insertion projects and government support for research and development expenditures may reduce our ability to apply our ongoing investments in some market areas 

we may be unable to successfully introduce new and enhanced products in a timely and costeffective manner or increase our participation in new markets which could harm our profitability and prospects 

our operating results depend in part on our ability to introduce new and enhanced products on a timely basis in order to improve our product development capabilities we purchased the research center that is now teledyne scientific company in 2006 and in 2011 we purchased dalsa which has access to a wellequipped mems research and development center in 2013 we opened a 52000squarefoot technology development center in daytona beach florida primarily to serve the offshore oil and gas production and exploration industries we are currently upgrading infrastructure at teledyne e2v’s facility in chelmsford uk and are expanding teledyne dalsa’s mems foundry in bromont quebec successful product development and introduction depend on numerous factors including our ability to anticipate customer and market requirements changes in technology and industry standards our ability to differentiate our offerings from offerings of our competitors and market acceptance we may not be able to develop and introduce new or enhanced products in a timely and costeffective manner or to develop and introduce products that satisfy customer requirements 

our new products also may not achieve market acceptance or correctly address new industry standards and technological changes we may also lose any technological advantage to competitors if we fail to develop new products in a timely manner 

additionally new products may trigger increased warranty costs as information on such products is augmented by actual usage accelerated entry of new products to meet heightened market demand and competitive pressures may cause additional warranty costs as development and testing time periods might be accelerated or condensed 

we intend to both adapt our existing technologies and develop new products to expand into new market segments we may be unsuccessful in accessing these and other new markets if our products do not meet our customers’ requirements as a result of changes in either technology and industry standards or because of actions taken by our competitors 

technological change and evolving industry and regulatory standards could cause some of our products or services to become obsolete or noncompetitive 

the markets for some of our products and services are characterized by rapid technological development evolving industry standards changes in customer requirements and new product introductions and enhancements a faster than anticipated change in one or more of the technologies related to our products or services or in market demand for products or services based on a particular technology could result in faster than anticipated obsolescence of certain of our products or services and could lead to reduced sales of those products which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition currently accepted industry and regulatory standards are also subject to change which may contribute to the obsolescence of our products or services failure to comply ce marking directives may prevent some of our products from being sold into europe and the cost to comply with these directives may make our products noncompetitive the political agenda of the us presidential administration may affect the level of environmental regulations and enforcement and government spending on scientific research which could adversely impact the sales of our products and services including sales of pollution monitoring instruments and instruments used to measure the earth’s climate and climate change such as undersea gliders and spacebased imaging sensors a change in chinas recent economic policies promoting pollution reduction could result in lower sales or slower sales growth for our pollution monitoring and laboratory instrumentation to that country 

we may not be able to reduce the costs of our products to satisfy customers’ cost reduction mandates which could harm our sales or margins 

more and more customers continue to seek price reductions of our products while we continually work to reduce our manufacturing and other costs of our products without affecting product quality and reliability there is no assurance that we will be able to do so and do so in a timely manner to satisfy the pricing pressures of our customers cost reductions of raw materials and other components used in our products may be beyond our control depending on market conditions customers may seek lower cost products from china and other developing countries where manufacturing costs are lower 

the airline industry is heavily regulated and if we fail to comply with applicable requirements our results of operations could suffer 

governmental agencies throughout the world including the us federal aviation administration or the faa prescribe standards and qualification requirements for aircraft components including virtually all commercial airline and general aviation products specific regulations vary from country to country although compliance with faa requirements generally satisfies regulatory requirements in other countries if any material authorization or approval qualifying us to supply our products is revoked or suspended then the sale of the product would be prohibited by law which would have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

from time to time the faa or equivalent regulatory agencies in other countries propose new regulations or changes to existing regulations which are usually more stringent than existing regulations if these proposed regulations are adopted and enacted we may incur significant additional costs to achieve compliance which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations recent trends by china’s aviation authority to relax restrictions on airspace may be reversed and anticipated new regulations loosening airspace restrictions may not materialize which could impact the future prospects of our commercial aerospace businesses 

  increasing competition could reduce the demand for our products and services 

each of our markets is highly competitive many of our competitors have and potential competitors could have greater name recognition a larger installed base of products more extensive engineering manufacturing marketing and distribution capabilities and greater financial technological and personnel resources than we do new or existing competitors may also develop new technologies that could adversely affect the demand for our products and services in particular we face increased competition with respect to the sale of our flight data acquisition systems including from airbus and boeing and from new competitors that entered this market as certain of our patents related to these products have expired in 2018 and will expire in upcoming years we also face new competition for our protocol analyzers products industry acquisition and consolidation trends particularly among aerospace and defense contractors have adversely impacted demand for our aerospace and defense related engineering services as large prime contractors insource increased amounts of major acquisition programs and also require significant expansion in small business participation to meet government contracting goals lowcost competition from china and other developing countries could also result in decreased demand for our products increasing competition could reduce the volume of our sales or the prices we may charge which would negatively impact our revenues smaller defense budgets both in the united states and europe could result in additional competition for new and existing defense programs 

product liability claims product recalls and field service actions could have a material adverse effect on our reputation business results of operations and financial condition and we may have difficulty obtaining product liability and other insurance coverage 

as a manufacturer and distributor of a wide variety of products including monitoring instruments products used in offshore oil and gas production products used in transportation and commercial aviation and products used in medical devices most recently including xray detectors and generators our results of operations are susceptible to adverse publicity regarding the quality or safety of our products in part product liability claims challenging the safety of our products may result in a decline in sales for a particular product which could adversely affect our results of operations this could be the case even if the claims themselves are proven untrue or settled for immaterial amounts 

while we have general liability and other insurance policies concerning product liabilities and errors and omissions we have selfinsured retentions or deductibles under such policies with respect to a portion of these liabilities awarded damages could be more than our accruals we could incur losses above the aggregate annual policy limit as well we cannot assure that for 2019 and in future years insurance carriers will be willing to renew coverage or provide new coverage for product liability 

product recalls can be expensive and tarnish our reputation and have a material adverse effect on the sales of our products we cannot assure that we will not have additional product liability claims or that we will not recall any products 

we have been joined among a number of defendants often over 100 in lawsuits alleging injury or death as a result of exposure to asbestos in addition because of the prominent “teledyne” name we may continue to be mistakenly joined in lawsuits involving a company or business that was not assumed by us as part of our 1999 spinoff to date we have not incurred material liabilities in connection with these lawsuits however our historic insurance coverage including that of its predecessors may not fully cover such claims and the defense of such matters coverage typically depends on the year of purported exposure and other factors nonetheless we intend to vigorously defend our position against these claims 

teledyne brown engineering inc and other teledyne companies manufacture components for customers in the nuclear power market including utilities and certain governmental entities certain liabilities associated with such products are covered by the priceanderson nuclear industries indemnity act and other statutory and common law defenses and we have 

received indemnities from some of our customers however there is no assurance we will not face product liability claims related to such products or that our exposure will not exceed the amounts for which we have liability coverage or protection 

our business and financial results could be adversely affected by conditions and other factors associated with our suppliers 

some items we purchase for the manufacture of our products are purchased from limited or single sources of supply due to technical capability price and other factors for example teledyne digital imaging has a single source of supply for ccd semiconductor wafers used to assemble image sensors and an external single source of supply for cmos semiconductor wafers used to assemble xray panel products in 2018 a fire at a netherlandsbased facility of a key supplier of printed circuit boards resulted in delivery disruptions to the electronics industry including to businesses in our digital imaging segment lecroy continues to outsource a portion of its research and development activities to a third party engineering firm in malaysia where it may be more difficult for us to enforce our intellectual property rights we have also outsourced from time to time the manufacturing of certain parts components subsystems and even finished products to single or limited sources including international sources disruption of these sources or supplierimposed rationing of scarce components could cause delays or reductions in shipments of our products or increases in our costs which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or operations international sources possess additional risks some of which are similar to those described above in regard to international sales with any continuing disruption in the global economy and financial markets some of our suppliers may also continue to face issues gaining access to sufficient credit and materials to maintain their businesses which could reduce the availability of some components and to the extent such suppliers are single source suppliers could adversely affect our ability to continue to manufacture and sell our products 

we face risks related to sales through distributors and other third parties that we do not control which could harm our business 

we sell a portion of our products through third parties such as distributors valueadded resellers and oems collectively “distributors” using third parties for distribution exposes teledyne to many risks including concentration credit risk and compliance risks we may rely on one or more key distributors for a product and the loss of these distributors could reduce our revenue distributors may face financial difficulties including bankruptcy which could harm our collection of accounts receivables and financial results violations of the foreign corrupt practices act or similar antibribery laws by distributors or other third party intermediaries could have a material impact on our business competitors could also block our access to key distributors failing to manage risks related to our use of distributors may reduce sales increase expenses and weaken our competitive position and could result in sanctions against us 

compliance with increasing environmental and climate change regulations as well as the effects of potential environmental liabilities could have a material adverse financial effect on us 

we like other industry participants are subject to various federal state local and international environmental laws and regulations we may be subject to increasingly stringent environmental standards in the future particularly as greenhouse gas emissions and climate change regulations and initiatives increase future developments administrative actions or liabilities relating to environmental and climate change matters could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition environmental regulations on hydraulic fracturing and the use of seismic energy sources for offshore energy exploration could adversely affect some product lines of our instrumentation segment 

our manufacturing operations including former operations could expose us to material environmental liabilities additionally companies we acquire may have environmental liabilities that are not accurately assessed or brought to our attention at the time of the acquisition 

the us environmental protection agency “epa” has focused on greenhouse gases “ghgs” maintaining ghgs threaten the public health and welfare of the american people the epa also maintains that ghg emissions from onroad vehicles contribute to that threat the epa’s endangerment finding covers emissions of six greenhouse gases the epa’s continuing efforts to limit ghg emissions could adversely affect our us manufacturing operations increase prices for energy fuel and transportation require us to accommodate changes in parameters such as the way parts are manufactured and may in some cases require us to redesign certain of our products this or other federal or state regulations could lead to increased costs which we may not be able to recover from customers delays in product shipments and loss of market share to competitors 

for additional discussion of environmental matters see the discussion under the caption “other matters  environmental” of “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of results of operation and financial condition” and note 14 to our notes to consolidated financial statements 

our inability to attract and retain key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our future success 

our future success depends to a significant extent upon the continued service of our executive officers and other key management and technical personnel and on our ability to continue to attract retain and motivate qualified personnel we also have a maturing workforce some of our businesses including those in traveling wave tube design and development draw from a pool of specialized engineering talent that is small and currently shrinking while we have engaged in succession planning the loss of the services of one or more of our key employees or our failure to attract retain and motivate qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations low unemployment in the united states has made it more difficult for some of our businesses to attract and retain direct labor in certain markets 

we may not be able to sell exit or reconfigure businesses facilities or product lines that we determine no longer meet with our growth strategy or that should be consolidated 

consistent with our strategy to emphasize growth in our core markets we continually evaluate our businesses to ensure that they are aligned with our strategy over the years we have also consolidated some of our business units and facilities including to deal with downturns in the defense and oil and gas industries among other reasons we may not be able to realize efficiencies and cost savings from our consolidation activities there is no assurance that our efforts will be successful if we do not successfully manage our current consolidation activities or any other similar activities that we may undertake in the future expected efficiencies and benefits might be delayed or not realized and our operations and business could be disrupted our ability to dispose of exit or reconfigure businesses that may no longer be aligned with our growth strategy will depend on many factors including the terms and conditions of any asset purchase and sale agreement or lease agreement as well as industry business and economic conditions we cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to sell nonstrategic businesses on terms that are acceptable to us or at all in addition if the sale of any nonstrategic business cannot be consummated or is not practical alternative courses of action including relocation of product lines or closure may not be available to us or may be more costly than anticipated 

natural and manmade disasters could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

several of our facilities as a result of their locations could be subject to a catastrophic loss caused by earthquakes hurricanes tornados floods ice storms or other natural disasters many of our production facilities and our headquarters are located in california and thus are in areas with above average seismic activity and may also be at risk of damage in wildfires in november 2018 wildfires impacted areas near our headquarters and principal research and development center in thousand oaks california resulting in temporary disruptions and evacuations of employees who lived nearby local utilities may impose blackouts during high fire risk weather conditions which could result in disruptions to our businesses located in california including our headquarters teledyne dalsa’s semiconductor facilities in quebec canada have been impacted by loss of electrical power caused by severe ice storms in addition we have manufacturing facilities in the southeastern united states and texas that have been threatened and struck by major hurricanes in 2017 our businesses located in houston texas were impacted by hurricane harvey and our business in florida was threatened by hurricanes irma and matthew our facilities in alabama florida nebraska tennessee and virginia have also been threatened by tornados in june 2012 a tornado caused substantial damage to and interrupted business at our teledyne hastings instruments facility in hampton virginia if any of our california facilities including our california headquarters were to experience a catastrophic earthquake or wildfire loss or if any of our alabama florida louisiana nebraska tennessee or texas facilities were to experience a catastrophic hurricane storm tornado or other natural disaster or if dalsa’s facilities in quebec experience longterm loss of electrical power such event could disrupt our operations delay production shipments and revenue and result in large expenses to repair or replace the facility or facilities while teledyne has property insurance to partially reimburse it for losses caused by windstorm and earth movement such insurance would not cover all possible losses in addition our existing disaster recovery and business continuity plans including those relating to our information technology systems may not be fully responsive to or minimize losses associated with catastrophic events 

disasters that do not directly impact us can have an indirect adverse impact on our business for example in 2018 a fire at a netherlandsbased facility of a key supplier of printed circuit boards resulted in delivery disruptions to the electronics industry including to businesses in our digital imaging segment 

teledyne brown engineering inc has developed built and launched a multi user system for earth sensing that is affixed to the iss for the program to be financially successful the 19 yearold iss must continue to fly in a safe and human tended condition while certain spaceflight risks such as a highvelocity debris impact to the station causing significant structural damage or necessitating the evacuation of the iss have been regarded as small if such event were to occur the iss program continuation could be threatened jeopardizing our investment and potential revenue generation from issbased earth imaging 

we may not be able to enforce or protect our intellectual property rights or third parties may claim infringement of their intellectual rights each which may harm our ability to compete and thus harm our business 

our ability to enforce and protect our patents copyrights software licenses trade secrets knowhow and other intellectual property rights is subject to general litigation risks as well as uncertainty as to the enforceability of our intellectual property rights in various countries when we seek to enforce our rights we have found that various claims may be asserted against us including claims that our intellectual property right is invalid is otherwise not enforceable or is licensed to the party against whom we are asserting a claim in addition we may be the target of aggressive and opportunistic enforcement of patents by third parties if we are not ultimately successful in defending ourselves against these claims in litigation we may not be able to sell a particular product or family of products due to an injunction or we may have to pay damages that could in turn harm our results of operations our inability to enforce our intellectual property rights under these circumstances may harm our competitive position and our business 

higher tax rates may harm our results of operations and cash flow 

our effective tax rate for 2018  was 153  compared with 208  for 2017  and 209  for 2016  while in december 2017 the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 “tax act” was signed into law which in general lowers corporate tax rates in the united states a number of factors may impact our effective tax rates which could reduce our net income and increase our tax payments including 

 our financial statements are based on estimates required by generally accepted accounting principles in the united states “gaap” and actual results may differ materially from those estimated under different assumptions or conditions 

our financial statements are prepared in conformity with gaap these principles require our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period for example estimates are used when accounting for items such as asset valuations allowances for doubtful accounts allowance for excess and obsolete inventory depreciation and amortization impairment assessments employee benefits taxes recall and warranty costs product and general liability and contingencies while we base our estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances at the time made actual results may differ materially from those estimated our most critical accounting estimates are described in “item 7 management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in this form 10k under “critical accounting estimates” 

there are inherent limitations in internal control systems and misstatements resulting from error or fraud may occur and may not be detected 

we continue to take action to assure compliance with the internal controls disclosure controls and other requirements of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer cannot guarantee that our internal controls and disclosure controls will prevent all possible errors or all fraud a control system no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met in addition the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefit of controls must be relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no system of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within the company have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake further controls can be circumvented by individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more persons or by management override of the controls the design of any system of controls is also based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions over time a control may be inadequate because of changes in conditions or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate because of inherent limitations in a costeffective control system misstatements resulting from error or fraud may occur and may not be detected 

provisions of our governing documents applicable law and our change in control severance agreements could make an acquisition of teledyne more difficult 

our restated certificate of incorporation our amended and restated bylaws and the general corporation law of the state of delaware contain several provisions that could make the acquisition of control of teledyne in a transaction not approved by our board of directors more difficult we have also entered into change in control severance agreements with ten members of our current management which could have an antitakeover effect these provisions may prevent or discourage attempts to acquire our company 

the market price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly since we became a public company and could continue to do so 

since we became an independent public company on november 29 1999 the market price of our common stock has fluctuated substantially and fluctuations in our stock price could continue in 2018 the closing price of our common stock ranged from 17556 to 24777 

among the factors that could affect our stock price are 

 the stock markets in general and the markets for hightechnology companies in particular have experienced a high degree of volatility that is not necessarily related to the operating performance of these companies we cannot provide assurances as to our stock price we have in the past repurchased shares of our stock pursuant to boardapproved stock repurchase programs we cannot provide assurances that we will continue to repurchase shares under those programs or that our board will authorize new repurchase programs

consistent with this strategy in march 2017 we made our largest acquisition to date e2v technologies plc “e2v” e2v provides high performance image sensors and custom camera solutions and application specific standard products for the machine vision market in addition e2v provides high performance space qualified imaging sensors and arrays for space science and astronomy e2v also produces components and subsystems that deliver high reliability radio frequency power generation for healthcare industrial and defense applications finally e2v provides high reliability semiconductors and boardlevel solutions for use in aerospace space and communications applications no material acquisitions were made in 2018  one other acquisition was made in 2017  and five acquisitions were made in 2016  

on february 5 2019 we acquired the scientific imaging businesses of roper for 2250 million in cash the scientific imaging businesses include princeton instruments photometrics and lumenera as well as other brands these businesses provide a range of imaging solutions primarily for life sciences academic research and customized oem industrial imaging solutions princeton instruments and photometrics manufacture stateoftheart cameras spectrographs and optics for advanced research in physical sciences life sciences research and spectroscopy imaging applications and markets include materials analysis quantum technology and cell biology imaging using fluorescence and chemiluminescence lumenera primarily provides rugged usbbased customized cameras for markets such as traffic management as well as life sciences applications 

in the second quarter of 2018 we realigned the reporting structure for certain of our microwave product groupings these products acquired with the acquisition of e2v were formerly reported as part of the aerospace and defense electronics segment and are now reported as part of the digital imaging segment previously reported segment data has been adjusted to reflect this change total sales for these products were 242 million for fiscal year 2017 

in the third quarter of 2016 teledyne completed the disposition of the net assets of its printed circuit technology “pct” business for 93 million in cash resulting in no gain or loss pct was part of the aerospace and defense electronics segment in connection with the sale we entered into a transition services agreement effective july 8 2016 to provide certain administrative services to facilitate the orderly transfer of the business operations to the buyer the transition services agreement terminated in 2017 in addition in 2016 we sold a former operating facility in california and recorded a pretax gain of 179 million 

as part of a continuing effort to reduce costs and improve operating performance we may take and have taken actions to consolidate and relocate certain facilities and reduce headcount across various businesses reducing our exposure to weak end markets and high cost locations we continue to seek cost reductions in our businesses at december 30 2018 28 million remains to be paid related to these actions

the 2018  sales increase of 127 million  reflected higher sales of 247 million of engineered products and services partially offset by lower sales of 120 million of turbine engines the higher sales of engineered products and services primarily reflected increased nuclear and aviation manufacturing programs and increased sales related to missile defense sales of turbine engines reflected lower sales of cruise missile engines operating income in 2018  increased due to higher sales of engineered products and services partially offset by lower sales of turbine engines 

cost of sales for 2018  increased by 126 million  compared with 2017  and reflected the impact of higher net sales cost of sales as a percentage of net sales for 2018  increased to 812  compared with 803  in 2017  selling general and administrative expenses including research and development and bid and proposal expense decreased to 237 million  in 2018 compared with 243 million  in 2017 and reflected the impact of lower research and development and bid and proposal expense of 17 million the selling general and administrative expense percentage decreased to 79  for 2018 compared with 85  in 2017 and reflected the impact of lower research and development and bid and proposal expense 

2017  compared with 2016   

our engineered systems segment net sales for 2017 increased 107 compared with 2016 operating income for 2017 increased 208 compared with 2016 

the 2017 net sales increase of 276 million reflected higher sales of 201 million of engineered products and services and 90 million of turbine engines partially offset by lower sales of 15 million of energy systems products the higher sales of engineered products and services primarily reflected greater sales from missile defense space and marine manufacturing programs the higher sales of turbine engines reflected greater sales for the jassm missile program operating income in 2017 reflected the impact of higher net sales and a greater proportion of higher margin manufacturing programs 

cost of sales for 2017 increased by 185 million compared with 2016 and reflected the impact of higher net sales cost of sales as a percentage of sales for 2017 decreased to 803 compared with 818 in 2016 selling general and administrative expenses including research and development and bid and proposal expense increased to 243 million in 2017 compared with 207 million in 2016 and reflected the impact of higher sales and higher research and development and bid and proposal expense of 20 million the selling general and administrative expense percentage increased to 85 for 2017 compared with 80 in 2016 and reflected the impact higher research and development and bid and proposal expense 

financial condition liquidity and capital resources 

principal capital requirements 

our principal cash and capital requirements are to fund working capital needs capital expenditures income tax payments and debt service requirements as well as acquisitions we may deploy cash for the stock repurchase program it is anticipated that operating cash flow together with available borrowings under the credit facility described below will be sufficient to meet these requirements and could be used to fund acquisitions in 2019 to support acquisitions we may need to raise additional capital our liquidity is not dependent upon the use of offbalance sheet financial arrangements we have no offbalance sheet financing arrangements that incorporate the use of special purpose or unconsolidated entities 

credit facility senior notes and term loans 

in march 2017 teledyne entered into a 1000 million term loan with a maturity date of october 30 2019 subsequently in march 2017 teledyne entered into a cross currency swap to effectively convert the 1000 million term loan to a €930 million denominated instrument with a fixed euro interest rate of 07055 the proceeds from the term loan were used in connection with the acquisition of e2v in april 2017 teledyne entered into a note purchase agreement for a private placement of €2500 million of senior unsecured notes due through april 2024 teledyne used the proceeds of this private placement note issuance among other things to repay indebtedness and for general corporate purposes 

the company has a 7500 million unsecured credit facility “credit facility” that matures in december 2020 excluding interest and fees no payments are due under the credit facility until it matures borrowings under our credit facility and term loans are at variable rates which are at our option tied to a eurocurrency rate equal to libor london interbank offered rate plus an applicable rate or a base rate as defined in our credit agreements eurocurrency rate loans may be denominated in us dollars or an alternative currency as defined in the agreement eurocurrency or libor based loans under the facility typically have terms of one two three or six months and the interest rate for each such loan is subject to change if the loan is continued or converted following the applicable maturity date the company has not drawn any loans with a term longer than three months under the credit facility base rate loans have interest rates that primarily fluctuate with changes in the prime rate interest rates are also subject to change based on our consolidated leverage ratio as defined in the credit agreement the credit facility also provides for facility fees that vary between 012 and 025 of the credit line depending on our consolidated leverage ratio as calculated from time to time the company expects to amend the credit facility in the first quarter of 2019 in order to extend the maturity date from december 2020 to march 2024 in anticipation of the expected elimination of libor in 2021 this credit facility amendment will include the procedure to switch to libor alternative replacement rates in the future 



at december 30 2018  we had 31 million  in capital leases of which 09 million  is current at december 30 2018  we had 413 million  in outstanding letters of credit 

our credit facility senior notes and term loans agreements require the company to comply with various financial and operating covenants including maintaining certain consolidated leverage and interest coverage ratios as well as minimum net worth levels and limits on acquired debt at december 30 2018  the company was in compliance with these covenants and we had a significant amount of margin between required financial covenant ratios and our actual ratios currently we do not believe our ability to undertake additional debt financing if needed is reasonably likely to be materially impacted by debt restrictions under our credit agreements subject to our complying with required financial covenants listed in the table below 

financial covenant ratios and the actual ratios at december 30 2018    



 in the event of an acquisition our debt instruments permit us at our option to exceed the consolidated leverage ratio of 325 to 1 for up to four quarters following the fiscal quarter in which the acquisition event occurs provided that the consolidated leverage ratio does not exceed 35 to 1 

available borrowing capacity under the 7500 million credit facility which is reduced by borrowings and outstanding letters of credit was 6863 million  at december 30 2018  

  

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our expected cash outflows resulting from financial contracts and commitments at december 30 2018  

the amounts in the following table are generally consistent from year to year closely reflect our levels of production and are not longterm in nature 



  

 

unrecognized tax benefits of 250 million are not included in the table above because 92 million is offset by deferred tax assets and the remainder cannot be reasonably estimated to be settled in cash due to a lack of prior settlement history and offsetting credits 

at december 30 2018  we were not required and accordingly are not planning to make any cash contributions to the domestic qualified pension plan for 2019 our minimum funding requirements after 2019 as set forth by erisa are dependent on several factors as discussed under “accounting for pension plans” in the critical accounting policies section of this management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation estimates beyond 2019 have not been provided due to the significant uncertainty of these amounts which are subject to change until the company’s pension assumptions can be updated at the appropriate times in addition certain pension contributions are eligible for future recovery through the pricing of products and services to the us government under certain government contracts therefore future cash contributions are not necessarily indicative of the impact these contributions may have on our liquidity we also have payments due under our other postretirement benefit plans these plans are not required to be funded in advance but are pay as you go see further discussion in note 11 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements teledyne intends to continue to monitor and manage its defined benefit pension plans obligation and may take additional actions to manage risk in the future 

operating activities 

in 2018  net cash provided by operating activities was 4469 million  compared with 3747 million  in 2017  and 3170 million  in 2016  the higher cash provided by operating activities in 2018 compared with 2017 was driven by higher operating income partially offset by higher income tax payments of 280 million the higher cash provided by operating activities in 2017 compared with 2016 reflected cash flow from e2v and the impact of higher operating income partially offset by 121 million in higher income tax payments and the impact of transaction related payments for the e2v acquisition 

free cash flow cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures was 3601 million  in 2018  compared with 3162 million  in 2017  and 2294 million  in 2016  adjusted free cash flow reflects the utilization of restricted cash from the sale of a former operating facility which funded in part the facility purchase pursuant to a 1031 likekind exchange and was 3601 million  in 2018 compared with 3162 million  in 2017  and 2489 million  in 2016  



  

 investing activities 

net cash used in investing activities was 886 million  8312 million  and 1510 million  for 2018 2017 and 2016 respectively cash flows relating to investing activities consists primarily of cash used for acquisitions and other investments and capital expenditures except 2016 also includes 93 million of cash received from the sale of a business and cash received of 195 million from the sale of a former operating facility 



the increase in capital spending in 2018 compared with 2017 primarily reflects facility upgrades and expansions the 2016 capital spending amount reflected the purchase of an operating facility for 260 million in the instrumentation segment during 2019 we plan to invest approximately 900 million  in capital expenditures principally to upgrade facilities and capital equipment reduce manufacturing costs and introduce new products 

acquisitions 

investing activities used cash for acquisitions and other investments of 31 million  7741 million  and 934 million  in 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively see “recent acquisitions” teledyne funded the acquisitions primarily from borrowings under its credit facilities issuance of senior notes and term loans and cash on hand on february 5 2019 we acquired the scientific imaging businesses of roper technologies inc for 2250 million in cash 

for all acquisitions the results of operations and cash flows are included in our consolidated financial statements from the date of each respective acquisition 

the following table shows the purchase price net of cash acquired goodwill acquired and intangible assets acquired for the acquisitions and other investments made in 2017  in millions 



  

goodwill resulting from the ssi acquisition will be deductible for tax purposes goodwill resulting from the e2v acquisition will not be deductible for tax purposes 

financing activities 

financing activities for 2018  reflected net payments on debt of 3065 million  compared with net proceeds from debt of 3937 million  in 2017 and net payments on debt of 1631 million  for 2016 financing activities for 2017 reflected net borrowings from the 7500 million credit facility of 1650 million the proceeds from a 1000 million term loan and the proceeds from the private placement of €2500 million of senior unsecured notes financing activities in 2016 also included the payment of 116 million for an option contract in connection with the e2v acquisition fiscal years 2018  2017  and 2016  reflect proceeds from the exercise of stock options of 372 million  249 million  and 361 million  respectively 

other matters 

pension plans 

teledyne has a domestic qualified defined benefit pension plan covering substantially all us employees hired before january 1 2004 or approximately 12  of teledyne’s active employees as of december 30 2018 as of january 1 2004 new us hires participate in a domestic defined contribution plan in 2018 2017 and 2016 teledyne’s domestic pension plan was over 100 funded thus no cash contributions were made for the company’s domestic pension plan the discount rate for 2019 will increase to 459 from 402 in 2018 the company also has several small nonqualified domestic and foreignbased defined benefit pension plans 

income taxes 

our income tax expense deferred tax assets and liabilities and reserves for unrecognized tax benefits reflect management’s best assessment of estimated current and future taxes to be paid we are subject to income taxes in both the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions significant judgments and estimates are required in determining the consolidated income tax expense 

we intend to reinvest indefinitely the earnings of our material foreign subsidiaries in our operations outside of the united states the cash that the companys foreign subsidiaries hold for indefinite reinvestment is generally used to finance foreign operations and investments including acquisitions we estimate that future domestic cash generation will be sufficient to meet future domestic cash requirements due to the tax act us federal and applicable state income taxes have been accrued for the deemed repatriation at december 30 2018 the amount of undistributed foreign earnings was 3811 million for which we have not recorded a deferred tax liability of approximately 21 million for state corporate income taxes which would be due if reinvested foreign earnings were repatriated should we decide to repatriate the foreign earnings we would need to adjust our income tax provision in the period we determined that we would no longer indefinitely reinvest the earnings outside the united states 

deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amount in the financial statements which will result in taxable or deductible amounts in the future in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets within the jurisdiction from which they arise we consider all available positive and negative evidence including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities projected future taxable income taxplanning strategies and results of recent operations in projecting future taxable income we begin with historical results adjusted for the results of discontinued operations and incorporate assumptions about the amount of future state federal and foreign pretax operating income adjusted for items that do not have tax consequences the assumptions about future taxable income require significant judgment and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses in evaluating the objective evidence that historical results provide we consider three years of cumulative operating income based on the company’s history of operating earnings expectations of future operating earnings and potential tax planning strategies management believes that it is possible that some portion of deferred taxes will not be realized as a future tax benefit and therefore has recorded a valuation allowance 

we file income tax returns in the united states federal jurisdiction and in various states and foreign jurisdictions the company has substantially concluded on all us federal income tax matters for all years through 2014 united kingdom and france income tax matters for all years through 2014 and canadian income tax matters for all years through 2010 

costs and pricing 

inflationary trends in recent years have been moderate current inventory costs the increasing costs of equipment and other costs are considered in establishing sales pricing policies the company emphasizes cost containment and cost reductions in all aspects of its business 

hedging activities and market risk disclosures 

teledyne transacts business in various foreign currencies and has international sales and expenses denominated in foreign currencies subjecting the company to foreign currency risk the company ’ s primary objective is to protect the united states dollar value of future cash flows and minimize the volatility of reported earnings the company utilizes foreign currency forward contracts to reduce the volatility of cash flows primarily related to forecasted revenue and expenses denominated in canadian dollars for our canadian companies including teledyne digital imaging and in british pounds for our uk companies including e2v these contracts are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges the company has converted a us dollar denominated variable rate debt obligation into a euro fixed rate obligation using a receivefloat pay fixed cross currency swap this cross currency swap is designated as a cash flow hedge 

  the effectiveness of the cash flow hedge forward contracts excluding time value is assessed prospectively and retrospectively on a monthly basis using regression analysis as well as using other timing and probability criteria to receive hedge accounting treatment all hedging relationships are formally documented at the inception of the hedges and must be highly effective in offsetting changes to future cash flows on hedged transactions the effective portion of the cash flow hedge contracts’ gains or losses resulting from changes in the fair value of these hedges is initially reported net of tax as a component of accumulated other comprehensive incomeloss  “ aoci ”  in stockholders’ equity until the underlying hedged item is reflected in our consolidated statements of income at which time the effective amount in aoci is reclassified to cost of sales in our consolidated statements of income net deferred losses recorded in aoci net of tax for forward contracts that will mature in the next 12 months total 28 million these losses are expected to be offset by anticipated gains in the value of the forecasted underlying hedged item amounts related to the cross currency swap expected to be reclassified from aoci into income in the coming 12 months total 01 million 

in the event that the gains or losses in aoci are deemed to be ineffective the ineffective portion of gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value if any is reclassified to other income and expense in the event that the underlying forecasted transactions do not occur or it becomes remote that they will occur within the defined hedge period the gains or losses on the related cash flow hedges will be reclassified from aoci to other income and expense during the current reporting period all forecasted transactions occurred and therefore there were no such gains or losses reclassified to other income and expense as of december 30 2018  teledyne had foreign currency forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges to buy canadian dollars and to sell us dollars totaling 816 million  these foreign currency forward contracts have maturities ranging from march 2019 to february 2020 e2v had foreign currency forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges to buy british pounds and to sell us dollars totaling 172 million  these foreign currency forward contracts have maturities ranging from march 2019 to february 2020 together these contracts had a negative fair value of 42 million the cross currency swap has notional amounts of 930 million euros equivalent to 1000 million and matures in october 2019 

in addition the company utilizes foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate foreign exchange rate risk associated with foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities including intercompany receivables and payables as of december 30 2018  teledyne had foreign currency contracts of this type in the following currency pairs in millions 



these contracts had a negative fair value of 06 million  at december 30 2018  the gains and losses on these derivatives which are not designated as hedging instruments are intended to at a minimum partially offset the transaction gains and losses recognized in earnings all derivatives are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value as discussed below the accounting for gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value depends on the use of the derivative and whether it is designated and qualifies for hedge accounting teledyne does not use foreign currency forward contracts for speculative or trading purposes 

notwithstanding our efforts to mitigate portions of our foreign currency exchange rate risks there can be no assurance that our hedging activities will adequately protect us against the risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations a hypothetical 10 percent price change of the us dollar from its value at december 30 2018  would result in a decrease or 

increase in the fair value of our foreign currency forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges to buy canadian dollars and to sell us dollars by approximately 139 million  a hypothetical 10 percent price change in the us dollar from its value at december 30 2018  would result in a decrease or increase in the fair value of our eurous dollar cross currency swap designated as a cash flow hedge by approximately 107 million  

borrowings under our credit facility are at fixed rates that vary with the term and timing of each loan under the facility loans under the facility typically have terms of one two three or six months and the interest rate for each such loan is subject to change if the loan is continued or converted following the applicable maturity date interest rates are also subject to change based on our debt to earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization ratio as of december 30 2018  we had290 million outstanding under our 7500 million credit facility any borrowings under the company’s revolving credit line are based on a fluctuating market interest rate and consequently the fair value of any outstanding debt should not be affected materially by changes in market interest rates 

we believe that adequate controls are in place to monitor any hedging activities our primary exposure to market risk relates to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates we periodically evaluate these risks and have taken measures to mitigate these risks we own assets and operate facilities in countries that have been politically stable 

environmental 

we are subject to various federal state local and international environmental laws and regulations which require that we investigate and remediate the effects of the release or disposal of materials at sites associated with past and present operations these include sites at which teledyne has been identified as a potentially responsible party under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act commonly known as superfund and comparable state laws we are currently involved in the investigation and remediation of a number of sites reserves for environmental investigation and remediation totaled 60 million  at december 30 2018  and 51 million  at december 31 2017  as investigation and remediation of these sites proceed and new information is received the company will adjust accruals to reflect new information based on current information we do not believe that future environmental costs in excess of those already accrued will materially and adversely affect our financial condition or liquidity see also our environmental risk factor disclosure beginning on page 24 and notes 2 and 14 to our notes to consolidated financial statements 

government contracts 

we perform work on a number of contracts with the us department of defense and other agencies and departments of the us government including subcontracts with government prime contractors sales under these contracts with the us government which included contracts with the us department of defense were approximately 23  of total net sales in 2018  24  of total net sales in 2017  and 27  of total sales in 2016  for a summary of sales to the us government by segment see note 12 to our notes to consolidated financial statements sales to the us department of defense represented approximately 17  18  and 21  of total net sales for 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively 

performance under government contracts has certain inherent risks that could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business results of operations and financial condition government contracts are conditioned upon the continuing availability of congressional appropriations which usually occurs on a fiscal year basis even though contract performance may take more than one year see also our government contracts risks factor disclosure beginning on page 18 

for information on accounts receivable from the us government see note 5 to our notes to consolidated financial statements 

estimates and reserves 

our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent liabilities on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including those related to product returns and replacements allowance for doubtful accounts inventories intangible assets income taxes warranty obligations pension and other postretirement benefits longterm contracts environmental workers’ compensation and general liability employee benefits and other contingencies and litigation we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances at the time the results of which form the basis for making our judgments actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions in some cases such differences may be material see also critical accounting policies 

the following table reflects significant reserves and valuation accounts which are estimates and based on judgments as described above at december 30 2018  and december 31 2017  



  

a this table should be read in conjunction with the notes to consolidated financial statements 

b includes both longterm and shortterm reserves 

some of the company’s products are subject to standard warranties and the company provides for the estimated cost of product warranties we regularly assess the adequacy of our preexisting warranty liabilities and adjust amounts as necessary based on a review of historic warranty experience with respect to the applicable business or products as well as the length and actual terms of the warranties which are typically one year the product warranty reserve is included in current accrued liabilities and other longterm liabilities on the balance sheet 



critical accounting policies 

the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with united states generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the notes to the financial statements some of those judgments can be subjective and complex and therefore actual results could differ materially from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions our critical accounting policies are those that are reflective of significant judgment complexity and uncertainty and may potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions we have identified the following as critical accounting policies revenue recognition accounting for pension plans accounting for business combinations goodwill and other longlived assets and accounting for income taxes for additional discussion of the application of these and other accounting policies see note 2 of our notes to consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition 

we determine the appropriate method by which we recognize revenue by analyzing the nature of the products or services being provided as well as the terms and conditions of contracts or arrangements entered into with our customers we account for a contract when it has approval and commitment from both parties the rights of the parties are identified payment terms are identified the contract has commercial substance and collectability of consideration is probable a contract’s transaction price is allocated to each distinct good or service ie performance obligation identified in the contract and each performance obligation is valued based on its estimated relative standalone selling price for standard products or services list prices generally represent the standalone selling price for performance obligations where list price is not available we typically use the expected cost plus a margin approach to estimate the standalone selling price for that performance obligation approximately 60 of our revenue is recognized at a point in time with the remaining 40 recognized over time 

revenue recognized at a point in time relates primarily to the sale of standard or minimally customized products with control transferring to the customer generally upon the transfer of title this type of revenue arrangement is typical for our commercial contracts within the instrumentation digital imaging and aerospace and defense electronics segments and to a lesser extent for certain commercial contracts within the engineered systems segment relating to the sale of standard hydrogenoxygen gas generators in limited circumstances customer specified acceptance criteria exist if we cannot objectively demonstrate that the product meets those specifications prior to the shipment the revenue is deferred until customer acceptance is obtained performance obligations recognized at a point in time can include variable consideration such as product returns and sales allowances the estimation of this variable consideration and determination of whether to include estimated amounts as a reduction in the transaction price is based largely on an assessment of our anticipated performance and all information historical current and forecasted that is reasonably available to us 

revenue recognized over time relates primarily to contracts to design develop andor manufacture highly engineered products used in both defense and commercial applications this type of revenue arrangement is typical of our us government contracts and to a lesser extent for certain commercial contracts with both contract types occurring across all segments the customer typically controls the work in process as evidenced either by contractual termination clauses or by our right to payment for costs incurred to date plus a reasonable profit for products or services that do not have an alternative use as control transfers continuously over time on these contracts revenue is recognized based on the extent of progress towards completion of the performance obligation the selection of the method to measure progress towards completion requires judgment and is based on the nature of the products or services to be provided we generally use the costtocost measure of progress as this measure best depicts the transfer of control to the customer which occurs as we incur costs on our contracts under the costtocost method the extent of progress towards completion is measured based on the ratio of costs incurred to date to the total estimated costs at completion of the performance obligation the transaction price in these arrangements may include estimated amounts of variable consideration including award fees incentive fees contract amounts not yet funded or other provisions that can either increase or decrease the transaction price we estimate variable consideration at the amount to which we expect to be entitled and we include estimated amounts in the transaction price to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the estimation uncertainty is resolved the estimation of this variable consideration and determination of whether to include estimated amounts in the transaction price are based largely on an assessment of our anticipated performance and all information historical current and forecasted that is reasonably available to us 

the majority of our over time contracts have a single performance obligation as the promise to transfer the individual goods or services is not separately identifiable from other promises in the contracts and therefore not distinct over time contracts are often modified to account for changes in contract specifications and requirements we consider contract modifications to exist when the modification either creates new or changes the existing enforceable rights and obligations most of our contract modifications on over time contracts are for goods or services that are not distinct from the existing contract due to the significant integration service provided in the context of the contract and are accounted for as if they were part of that existing contract the effect of a contract modification on the transaction price and our measure of progress for the performance obligation to which it relates is recognized as an adjustment to revenue either as an increase in or a reduction of revenue on a cumulative catchup basis 

for over time contracts using costtocost we have an estimate at completion “eac” process in which management reviews the progress and execution of our performance obligations this eac process requires management judgment relative to assessing risks estimating contract revenue and cost and making assumptions for schedule and technical issues this eac process requires management’s judgment to make reasonably dependable cost estimates since certain contracts extend over a longer period of time the impact of revisions in cost and revenue estimates during the progress of work may adjust the current period earnings through a cumulative catchup basis this method recognizes in the current period the cumulative effect of the changes on current and prior quarters additionally if the current contract estimate indicates a loss a provision is made for the total anticipated loss in the period that it becomes evident contract cost and revenue estimates for significant contracts are generally reviewed and reassessed quarterly the majority of revenue recognized over time uses an eac process 

while extended or noncustomary warranties do not represent a significant portion of our revenue we recognize warranty services as a separate performance obligations when it is material to the contract when extended or noncustomary warranties represents a separate performance obligation the revenue is deferred and recognized ratably over the extended warranty period 

the timing of revenue recognition billings and cash collections results in billed accounts receivable unbilled receivables contract assets and customer advances and deposits contract liabilities which are included in accrued liabilities and other longterm liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet under the typical payment terms of our over time contracts the customer pays us either performancebased payments or progress payments amounts billed and due from our customers are classified as receivables on the consolidated balance sheet we may receive interim payments as work progresses although for some contracts we may be entitled to receive an advance payment we recognize a liability for these interim and advance payments in excess of revenue recognized and present it as a contract liability which is included within accrued liabilities and other longterm liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet 

 we do not believe that any discrete event or adjustment to an individual contract within the aggregate changes in contract estimates for 2018  2017  or 2016  was material to the consolidated statements of income for such annual periods 

in may 2014 the fasb issued asu no 201409 revenue from contracts with customers which provides a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and will supersede most current revenue recognition guidance we adopted the new guidance effective january 1 2018 for a discussion of this new accounting standard see note 2 of our notes to consolidated financial statements 

pension plans 

teledyne has a domestic qualified defined benefit pension plan covering substantially all us employees hired before january 1 2004 or approximately 12  of teledyne’s active employees as of january 1 2004 new us hires participate in a defined contribution plan only the company also has several small domestic nonqualified and foreignbased defined benefit pension plans at december 30 2018 the benefit obligation for the domestic defined benefit pension plans totaled 7317 million  and the fair value of the net qualified plan assets totaled 7803 million  at december 30 2018 the benefit obligation for the foreignbased pension plans totaled 523 million  and the fair value of the net plan assets totaled 434 million  the company’s accounting for its defined benefit pension plans requires that amounts recognized in financial statements be determined on an actuarial basis rather than as contributions are made to the plan in consultation with our actuaries we determine the appropriate assumptions for use in determining the liability for future pension benefits net actuarial gains or losses are amortized to expense on a planbyplan basis when they exceed the accounting corridor the accounting corridor is a defined range within which amortization of net gains and losses is not required and is equal to 10 percent of the greater of the market related value of assets or benefit obligations gains or losses outside of the corridor are subject to amortization over our average employee future service period of approximately nine years significant assumptions used in determining the company’s pension income or expense is the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets participant mortality estimates expected rates of increase in future compensation levels employee turnover as well as the assumed discount rate on pension obligations the company has assumed based upon the types of securities the domestic qualified pension plan assets are invested in and the longterm historical returns of these investments that the longterm expected return on the domestic qualified pension plan assets will be 78  in 2019 and the assumed discount rate for determining benefit obligations will be 459  in 2019 the company’s longterm expected return on the domestic qualified pension assets used in 2018  was 80 and the assumed discount rate used in 2018  was 402  the actual rate of return on the domestic qualified pension plan assets was a negative 44 in 2018  and a positive return of 157 in 2017  for its domestic qualified pension plan if the actual rate of return on pension assets is below the expected rate of return the company may be required to make additional contributions to the pension trust at december 30 2018 the domestic qualified pension plan is overfunded and contributions are not required the company did not make any cash contributions to its domestic qualified pension plan since 2013 when it made a voluntary pretax cash contribution of 830 million  each year beginning with 2014 the society of actuaries has released revised mortality tables which updated life expectancy assumptions in consideration of these tables we updated the mortality assumptions used in determining our pension obligations at yearend 2018  the company has a 3087 million  noncash reduction to stockholders’ equity and a longterm additional liability of 4062 million  related to its pension plans at yearend 2017  the company had a 2295 million  noncash reduction to stockholders’ equity and a longterm additional liability of 3663 million  related to its pension plans 

differences in the discount rate and expected longterm rate of return on assets within the indicated range would have had the following impact on 2018  pension expense in millions

the results for all acquisitions are included in the company’s consolidated financial statements from the date of each respective acquisition business acquisitions are accounted for under the acquisition method by assigning the purchase price to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at their fair values and the excess of the purchase price over the amounts assigned is recorded as goodwill we determine the fair value of such assets and liabilities generally in consultation with thirdparty valuation advisors acquired intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives adjustments to fair value assessments are recorded to goodwill over the purchase price allocation period 

goodwill and acquired intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized we review goodwill and acquired indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable the company also performs an annual impairment test in the fourth quarter of each year we test goodwill and acquired indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment between annual tests if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce our enterprise fair value below its book value these events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate including a significant sustained decline in an entity’s market value legal factors operating performance indicators competition sale or disposition of a significant portion of the business or other factors recorded impairment charges to acquired intangibles assets were not material in 2018 2017 or 

2016 the results of our annual impairment tests of goodwill indicated that no impairment existed in 2018 2017 or 2016 

we may use either a qualitative or quantitative approach when testing a reporting unit’s goodwill for impairment for selected reporting units where we use the qualitative approach we perform a qualitative evaluation of events and circumstances impacting the reporting unit to determine the likelihood of goodwill impairment based on that qualitative evaluation if we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount no further evaluation is necessary otherwise we perform a quantitative impairment test we perform quantitative tests for most reporting units at least once every three years however for certain reporting units we may perform a quantitative impairment test every year 

for goodwill impairment testing using the quantitative test the company estimates the fair value of the selected reporting units mainly through using a discounted cash flow model based on our best estimate of amounts and timing of future revenues and cash flows and our most recent business and strategic plans and compares the estimated fair value to the carrying value of the reporting unit including goodwill the discounted cash flow model requires judgmental assumptions about projected revenue growth future operating margins discount rates and terminal values over a multiyear period there are inherent uncertainties related to these assumptions and management’s judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill impairment while the company believes it has made reasonable estimates and assumptions to calculate the fair value of its reporting units it is possible a material change could occur if actual results are not consistent with management’s estimates and assumptions goodwill may be overstated and a charge would need to be taken against net earnings 

as of december 30 2018  the company had 12 reporting units for goodwill impairment testing the carrying value of goodwill included in the company’s individual reporting units ranges from 12 million to 7194 million the company’s analysis in 2018 indicated that in all instances the fair value of the company’s reporting units exceeded their carrying values and consequently did not result in an impairment charge the excess of the estimated fair value over the carrying value expressed as a percentage of carrying value of the respective reporting unit for each of the company’s reporting units subject to a quantitative analysis as of the fourth quarter of 2018 the annual testing date ranged from approximately 29 to 140 

changes in our projections used in the discounted cash flow model could affect the estimated fair value of certain of the company’s reporting units and could result in a goodwill impairment charge in a future period in order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations used in the quantitative goodwill impairment test the company applied a hypothetical 10 decrease to the fair values of each reporting unit subject to a quantitative impairment test and compared those values to the reporting unit carrying values based on this sensitivity analysis the company did not identify any goodwill impairment due to the many variables inherent in the estimation of a reporting unit’s fair value and the relative size of our recorded goodwill differences in assumptions may have a material effect on the results of our impairment analysis 

the impairment test for indefinitelived intangibles other than goodwill primarily trademarks and trade names consists of a comparison of the fair value of the indefinitelived intangible asset to the carrying value of the asset as of the impairment testing date the company estimates the fair value of its indefinitelived intangibles using a discounted cash flow model based on our best estimate of amounts and timing of future revenues from our most recent business and strategic plans and compares the estimated fair value to the carrying value of the asset 

income taxes 

income tax expense and deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect management’s assessment of actual future taxes to be paid on items reflected in the financial statements significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes uncertainty exists regarding tax positions taken in previously filed tax returns still under examination and positions expected to be taken in the current year and future returns deferred tax assets and liabilities arise due to differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and tax carryforwards although we believe our income tax expense and deferred tax assets and liabilities are reasonable no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome will not be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals to the extent that the final tax outcome is different than the amounts recorded such differences will impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made the provision for income taxes includes the impact of uncertain tax benefits that are considered appropriate as well as the related net interest 

significant judgment is required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets in assessing the need for a valuation allowance we consider all available evidence including past operating results estimates of future taxable income and the feasibility of tax planning strategies in the event that we change our determination as to the amount of deferred tax assets that can be realized we will adjust our valuation allowance with a corresponding impact to the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made 

we record uncertain tax benefits on the basis of a twostep process whereby 1 we determine whether it is more likely than not that the tax positions will be sustained on the basis of the technical merits of the positions and 2 for those tax positions that meet the “morelikelythannot” recognition threshold we recognize the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50 percent likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement with the related tax authority 

on december 22 2017 the tax act was enacted which significantly revised the us corporate income tax by among other things lowering corporate income tax rates implementing the territorial tax system and imposing a tax on deemed repatriation of nonus earnings the repatriation tax resulted in a net tax expense of 262 million and the remeasurement of us deferred tax assets and liabilities resulted in a net tax benefit of 215 million for a net provisional charge of 47 million recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017 the company finalized its assessment of the tax act during the fourth quarter of 2018 resulting in a decrease of 08 million to the provisional charge and the repatriation tax at december 30 2018 120 million of the repatriation tax remained to be paid in february 2019 the remaining balance of 120 million was paid 

an increase of 100 basis point increase in our nominal tax rate would have resulted in additional income tax provision for the fiscal year ended december 30 2018 of 39 million for a description of the company’s tax accounting policies refer to note 2 and note 10 of our notes to consolidated financial statements

customers 

we have hundreds of customers in the various industries we serve no commercial customer accounted for more than 10 of any segment net sales during 2017  2016  or 2015  no commercial customer in 2017 2016 or 2015 accounted for more than 30  of total net sales 

sales to international customers accounted for approximately 46  of total sales in 2017  compared with 43  in 2016  and 44  in 2015  in 2017  we sold products to customers in over 100 foreign countries approximately 90 of our sales to foreignbased customers were made to customers in 25 foreign countries in 2017  the top five countries for international sales were china  the united kingdom  germany  japan  and south korea  and constituted approximately 21  of our total sales 

approximately 24  27  and 26  of our total sales for 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively were derived from contracts with agencies of and prime contractors to the us government information on our sales to the us government including direct sales as a prime contractor and indirect sales as a subcontractor is as follows in millions 



our principal us government customer is the us department of defense these sales represented 18  21  and 19  of our total sales for 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively in both 2017 and 2016 our largest program with the us government was the mission operations and integration contract with the nasa marshall space flight center which represented 15 of our total sales in both years in 2015 our largest program with the us government was the engineering solutions and prototyping contract with the nasa marshall space flight center which represented 15 of our total sales 

as described under risk factors there are risks associated with doing business with the us government in 2017  approximately 58  of our us government prime contracts and subcontracts were fixedprice type contracts compared to 54  in 2016  and 54  in 2015  under these types of contracts we bear the inherent risk that actual performance cost may exceed the fixed contract price such contracts are typically not subject to renegotiation of profits if we fail to anticipate technical problems estimate costs accurately or control costs during performance additionally us government contracts are subject to termination by the us government at its convenience without identification of any default when contracts are terminated for convenience we recover costs incurred or committed settlement expenses and profit on work completed prior to termination we had nine  us government contract terminated for convenience in 2017  compared with one  in 2016  and eight  in 2015  

our total backlog of confirmed orders was approximately 12502 million  at december 31 2017  compared with 9164 million  at january 1 2017  and 8028 million  at january 3 2016  we expect to fulfill 93  of such backlog of confirmed orders during 2018 the increase in total backlog in 2017 primarily reflects backlog related to e2v which was acquired in 2017 

seasonality 

no material portion of our business is considered to be seasonal 

raw materials and suppliers 

generally our businesses have experienced minimal fluctuations in the supply of raw materials but not without some price volatility while some of our businesses provide services for those businesses that sell hardware and product a portion of the value that we provide is labororiented such as design engineering assembly and test activities in manufacturing our products we use our own production capabilities and also third party suppliers and subcontractors including international sources some of the items we use for the manufacture of our products including certain gyro components for some marine navigation applications certain magnets and helix wire for our traveling wave tubes certain infrared detectors substrates and certain ceramics and molding compounds used in our sonar systems as well as certain scintillator materials used in the production of our xray detectors are purchased from limited or single sources including international sources due to technical capability price and other factors at times we have experienced difficulty in procuring raw materials components subassemblies and other supplies required in our manufacturing processes due to shortages and supplier imposed allocation of components 

sales and marketing 

our sales and marketing approach varies by segment and by products within our segments a shared fundamental tenet is the commitment to work closely with our customers to understand their needs with an aim to secure preferred supplier and longerterm relationships 

our segments use a combination of internal sales forces thirdparty distributors and commissioned sales representatives to market and sell our products and services our teledyne instruments companies and other businesses have been working over the years to consolidate or share internal sales and servicing efforts several teledyne businesses have been marketing and selling products collaboratively to similar customers to promote “onestop” shopping under singular “brand” names including teledyne marine teledyne oil  gas teledyne water quality teledyne microwave solutions teledyne hirel electronics and teledyne advanced chemistry systems 

products are also advertised in appropriate trade journals and by means of various websites to promote our products and other capabilities our personnel regularly participate in relevant trade shows and professional associations 

many of our government contracts are awarded after a competitive bidding process in which we seek to emphasize our ability to provide superior products and technical solutions in addition to competitive pricing 

through teledyne technologies international corp and other subsidiaries we have established offices in foreign countries to facilitate international sales for various businesses locations include brazil china france germany italy japan malaysia singapore south korea and the united arab emirates 

competition 

we believe that technological capabilities and innovation and the ability to invest in the development of new and enhanced products are critical to obtaining and maintaining leadership in our markets and the industries in which we compete although we have certain advantages that we believe help us compete effectively in our markets each of our markets is highly competitive with regard to our defense businesses it is common in the defense industry for work on programs to be shared among a number of companies including competitors in any event because of the diversity of products sold and the number of markets we serve we encounter a wide variety of competitors none of which we believe offer all of the same product and service lines or serve all of the same markets as we do our businesses vigorously compete on the basis of quality product performance and reliability technical expertise price and service many of our competitors have and potential competitors could have greater name recognition a larger installed base of products more extensive engineering manufacturing marketing and distribution capabilities and greater financial technological and personnel resources than we do 

research and development 

our research and development efforts primarily involve engineering and design related to improving existing products and developing new products and technologies in the same or similar fields we incurred a total of 5084 million  in 2017  4583 million  in 2016  and 4766 million  in 2015  on research and development and bid and proposal costs customerfunded research and development most of which was attributable to work under contracts with the us government represented approximately 65  63  and 66  of total research and development and bid and proposal costs for 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively 

in 2017  we incurred 1777 million  in companyfunded research and development and bid and proposal costs we expect the level of companyfunded research and development and bid and proposal costs to be approximately 1800 million  in 2018 

intellectual property 

while we own and control various intellectual property rights including patents trade secrets confidential information trademarks trade names and copyrights which in the aggregate are of material importance to our business we believe that our business as a whole is not materially dependent upon any one intellectual property or related group of such properties we own several hundred active patents and are licensed to use certain patents technology and other intellectual property rights owned and controlled by others similarly other companies are licensed to use certain patents technology and other intellectual property rights owned and controlled by us 

patents patent applications and license agreements will expire or terminate over time by operation of law in accordance with their terms or otherwise we do not expect the expiration or termination of these patents patent applications and license agreements to have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

employees 

we consider our relations with our employees to be good at december 31 2017  our total workforce consisted of approximately 10340  employees of which approximately 6760  employees were located in the united states

risk factors cautionary statement as to forwardlooking statements 

the following text highlights various risks and uncertainties associated with teledyne these factors could materially affect “forwardlooking statements” within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 that we may make from time to time including forwardlooking statements contained in “item 1 business” and “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” of this form 10k and in teledyne’s 2017  annual report to stockholders it is not possible for management to predict all such factors and new factors may emerge additionally management cannot assess the impact of each such factor on teledyne or the extent to which any factor or combination of factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forwardlooking statements 

  

a new global recession continued economic uncertainty in europe or an economic downturn in china may adversely affect us 

if another global recession emerges if economic uncertainty in europe continues or worsens or if economic growth in china substantially slows we may experience declines in revenues profitability and cash flows from reduced orders payment delays collection difficulties increased price pressures for our products increased risk of excess and obsolete inventories or other factors caused by the economic problems of customers if negative conditions in the global credit markets prevent our customers’ access to credit or render them insolvent orders for our products may decrease which would result in lower revenue likewise if our suppliers face challenges in obtaining credit in selling their products or otherwise in operating their businesses or remaining solvent they may become unable to offer the materials we use to manufacture our products these events could adversely impact our ability to manufacture affected products and could also result in reductions in our revenue increased price competition and increased operating costs which could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we develop and manufacture products for customers in the energy exploration and production markets domestic and international commercial aerospace markets the semiconductor industry the consumer electronics telecommunications and automotive industries each of which has been cyclical exhibited rapid changes and suffered from fluctuating market demands a cyclical downturn in these markets may materially affect future operating results in 2015 and 2016 for example our revenue and income were negatively impacted by the downturn in energy markets 

in addition we sell products and services to customers in industries that are sensitive to the level of general economic activity and consumer spending habits and in more mature industries that are sensitive to capacity adverse economic conditions affecting these industries may reduce demand for our products and services which may reduce our revenues profits or production levels some of our businesses serve industries such as power generation and petrochemical refining which may be negatively impacted in the event of future reductions in global capital expenditures and manufacturing capacity 

a material amount of our total revenues is derived from companies in the oil and gas industry especially the offshore oil and gas industry a historically cyclical industry with levels of activity that are significantly affected by the levels and volatility of oil and gas prices 

a material amount of our total revenues is derived from customers in or connected to the oil and gas exploration development and production especially the offshore oil and gas industry one of our largest commercial customers is in the offshore oil and gas industry and accounted for 23  of total sales in 2015  in 2017 and 2016 no commercial customer in the offshore oil and gas industry accounted for more than 2 of total sales the oil and gas industry is a historically cyclical industry characterized by significant changes in the levels of exploration and development activities in 2014 and again in 2015 

and 2016 the price of brent crude oil experienced dramatic declines from a high of 116 per barrel in june 2014 to a low of 27 per barrel in january 2016 and was approximately 67 per barrel at the end of 2017 oil and gas prices and market expectations of potential changes in those prices significantly affect the levels of those activities worldwide political economic and military events have contributed to oil and gas price volatility and are likely to continue to do so in the future any prolonged reduction in the overall level of offshore oil and gas exploration and development activities whether resulting from changes in oil and gas prices or otherwise could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations of our businesses within our instrumentation segment 

some factors that have affected and are likely to continue affecting oil and gas prices and the level of demand for our services and products include the following 

 

teledyne manufactures seismic sources interconnects and data acquisition products used in offshore energy exploration when crude oil and natural gas prices are low the level of marine seismic exploration activity typically decreases potentially resulting in reduced demand for our products used in offshore energy exploration in addition a decline in the level of capital spending by oil and natural gas companies may result in a reduced pace of development of new energy reserves which could adversely affect demand for our products related to energy production and in certain instances result in the cancellation modification or rescheduling of existing orders 

with the 2017 acquisition of e2v the risk profile of teledyne may differ materially from prior years which could materially change our results of operations 

on march 28 2017 teledyne acquired e2v a leading designer developer and manufacturer of radio frequency “rf” power systems imaging solutions and semiconductors to the aerospace security and defense space medical scientific and industrial markets e2v is headquartered in the united kingdom with key operations in the united kingdom france the united states and spain as a result of the acquisition of e2v a greater percentage of teledyne’s revenues and expenses arise from international sources the acquisition also significantly expands teledyne’s international employee base and manufacturing footprint as a result of the acquisition of e2v the financial results of teledyne are more exposed to currency exchange rate fluctuations and an increased proportion of assets liabilities and earnings are denominated in nonus dollar currencies following the acquisition a significant proportion of teledyne’s net assets expenses and income are in nonus dollar currencies primarily the british pound the canadian dollar and the euro while teledyne’s financial results are presented in us dollars teledyne’s financial results and capital ratios are therefore more sensitive to movements in foreign exchange rates as a result of the acquisition a depreciation of nonus dollar currencies relative to the us dollar could have an adverse impact on the combined company’s financial results 

while most of the products made and markets served by e2v are complementary to teledyne the acquisition of e2v expanded the size of teledyne’s digital imaging segment relative to its other segments continued innovation and research and development efforts will be required to maintain e2v’s leadership position in imaging products and semiconductor production e2v’s business also may be more capital intensive than many of teledyne’s other businesses increasing teledyne’s capital requirements approximately 20 percent of e2v’s revenue relates to longterm contracts many of which involve advancements in technology and are fixed price as discussed below an inherent risk in fixed price contracts is that actual performance costs may exceed the projected costs on which the contracts are agreed the failure to anticipate technical problems estimate costs accurately or control costs during the performance of a fixed price contract can reduce its profitability or result in a loss 

we may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of the acquisition of e2v or those benefits may take longer to realize than expected 

even if the operations of the businesses of the teledyne and e2v are integrated successfully we may not realize the full benefits of the acquisition including the synergies cost savings or sales or growth opportunities that we expect or the full benefits may not be achieved within the anticipated time frame or at all additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the integration of the two businesses all of these factors could adversely affect our earnings decrease or delay the expected accretive effect of the acquisition or negatively impact the price of our common stock as a result we cannot assure that the combination of teledyne’s and e2v’s businesses will result in the realization of the full benefits anticipated from the acquisition 

our indebtedness and any failure to comply with our covenants that apply to our indebtedness could materially and adversely affect our business 

as of december 31 2017  we had 10682 million  in total outstanding indebtedness this indebtedness included 3250 million  in senior unsecured notes 3000 million  in euro denominated notes 1755 million  in term loans and 1650 million  outstanding under our 7500 million  2015amended credit facility our indebtedness could harm our business by among other things reducing the funds available to make acquisitions capital expenditures stock repurchases or reducing our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and market conditions our indebtedness exposes us to interest rate risk since a portion of our debt obligations are at variable rates our indebtedness could also have a material adverse effect on our business by increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions or a downturn in our business general adverse economic and industry conditions or a downturn in our business could result in our inability to repay this indebtedness in a timely manner 

we are subject to the risks associated with international sales and international operations which could harm our business or results of operations 

during 2017  sales to international customers accounted for approximately 46  of our total revenues compared with 43  in 2016  and 44  in 2015  in 2017  we sold products to customers in over 100 countries in 2017  the top five countries for international sales were china  the united kingdom  germany  japan  and south korea  constituting approximately 21  of our total sales our acquisitions including e2v in 2017 contributed to greater international sales and operations we anticipate that future sales to international customers will continue to account for a significant and increasing percentage of our revenues particularly since business and growth plans for many teledyne businesses focus on sales outside of the united states including to emerging markets such as china brazil and west africa 

risks associated with international sales include but are not limited to 

 any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition exchange rate fluctuations may negatively affect the cost of our products to international customers and therefore reduce our competitive position given our several canadabased businesses volatility in the value of the canadian dollar relative to the us dollar or other foreign currencies could adversely affect the business operations and the financial condition of our digital imaging segment 

in june 2016 the united kingdom “uk” held a referendum in which voters approved an exit from the european union “eu” commonly referred to as “brexit” the announcement of brexit caused significant volatility in global stock markets and currency exchange rate fluctuations that resulted in the strengthening of the us dollar against foreign currencies in which we conduct business the announcement of brexit and the pending withdrawal of the uk from the eu may also create further global economic uncertainty which may adversely impact the economies of the uk the eu countries and other nations may cause our current and future customers to reduce their spending on our products and services and may cause certain eubased customers to source products from businesses based outside of the uk for example brexitrelated uncertainty could lead to a reconsideration by airbus as to future investment and spending in the uk which could reduce sales for our ukbased businesses that supply airbus potential brexitrelated risks for our ukbased businesses also 

include increased import duties loss of customers in the eu delays in the movement of goods between the uk and the eu and loss of access to the eu labor pool given our several ukbased businesses including our 2017 acquisition of e2v volatility in the value of the british pound relative to the us dollar or other foreign currencies could increase the cost of raw materials and components for our ukbased businesses and could otherwise adversely affect the business operations and the financial condition of our ukbased businesses 

regional independence movements in scotland and spain could also adversely impact our businesses located in those jurisdictions 

sales of our products and services internationally are subject to us and local government regulations and procurement policies and practices including regulations relating to importexport control violations of export control rules could result in the impositions of fines and penalties or the suspension of our ability to export items from one or more businesses or the entire corporation depending on the scope of the suspension this could have a material effect on our ability to perform certain international contracts attempts by the presidential administration to withdraw from or materially modify international trade agreements could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

among other things we are subject to the us foreign corrupt practices act or fcpa which generally prohibits us companies and their intermediaries from bribing foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or keeping business or otherwise obtaining favorable treatment further in 2011 the united kingdom also implemented the uk bribery act which increased the level of antibribery law enforcement and compliance relative to the fcpa any determination that we had violated the fcpa the uk bribery act or equivalent antibribery and corruption laws in countries in which we do business could result in sanctions that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations while we have procedures and compliance programs in place and conduct fcpa and other trainings we cannot provide assurance that our internal controls will always protect us from misconduct by our employees agents or business partners 

our international operations are subject to risks customarily encountered in foreign operations including interruption to transportation flows for delivery of parts to us and finished goods to our customers changes in a specific country’s or region’s political or economic conditions trade protection measures import or export licensing requirements consequences from changes in tax laws and regulatory requirements difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations differing labor regulations differing protection of intellectual property and geopolitical turmoil including terrorism and war we are also exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk inherent in our sales commitments anticipated sales and expenses and assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the local functional currency and may also become subject to interest rate risk inherent in any debt we incur or financial investments we hold 

the eu adopted a comprehensive general data privacy regulation the “gdpr” in may 2016 and which will become fully effective in may 2018 the gdpr requires companies to satisfy new requirements regarding the handling of personal and sensitive data including its use protection and the ability of persons whose data is stored to correct or delete such data about themselves failure to comply with gdpr requirements could result in penalties of up to 4 of worldwide revenue the gdpr and other similar laws and regulations as well as any associated inquiries or investigations or any other government actions may be costly to comply with result in negative publicity increase our operating costs require significant management time and attention and subject us to remedies that may harm our business including fines or demands or orders that we modify or cease existing business practices 

acquisitions involve inherent risks that may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

our growth strategy includes acquisitions acquisitions involve various inherent risks such as 



 while we conduct financial and other due diligence in connection with our acquisitions and generally seek some form of protection including indemnification from a seller and sometimes an escrow of a portion of the purchase price to cover potential issues such acquired companies may have weaknesses or liabilities that are not accurately assessed or brought to our attention at the time of the acquisition further indemnities or escrows may not fully cover such matters particularly matters identified after a closing 

as they have over the last few years acquisitions may also change the nature and level of various risks faced by teledyne as noted above our 2017 acquisition of e2v increases our international presence and the percentage of sales related to the digital imaging segment these acquisitions coupled with our other recently acquired companies located outside of the united states also increased the percentage of revenues and expenses that arise from international sources and consequently our exposure to us and foreign policy changes and exchange rate fluctuations additionally the businesses of e2v and dalsa are more capital intensive than other teledyne businesses which could result in increasing teledyne’s capital requirements 

under sec rules teledyne must issue a report on management’s assessment of the effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting the sec permits a limited timebased exclusion for acquisitions to give a company an opportunity to evaluate more fully the internal controls of acquired companies and correct deficiencies and institute new or additional internal controls our 2017 management’s report specifically excludes from its scope and coverage our 2017 acquisitions of e2v and ssi assets allowing us additional time to evaluate existing internal controls and implement additional controls as appropriate with regard to future acquisitions we can provide no assurance that we will be able to provide a report that contains no significant deficiencies or material weaknesses with respect to these acquired companies or other acquisitions 

in connection with our acquisitions including ones which we do not complete we may incur significant transaction costs we are required to expense as incurred such transaction costs which may have a material adverse impact on our quarterly financial results further the acquisitions of us public companies such as bolt and lecroy routinely trigger purported class action lawsuits filed by shareholders of the target companies the defense of which has increased transaction costs among other things 

changes in future business conditions could cause business investments goodwill and other longlived assets to become impaired resulting in significant losses and writedowns that would reduce our operating income 

on december 31 2017  teledyne’s goodwill was 17767 million  and net acquired intangible assets were 3989 million  under current accounting guidance we are required to test annually both acquired goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment based upon a fair value approach rather than amortizing them over time we have chosen to perform our annual impairment reviews of goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year we also are required to test goodwill for impairment between annual tests if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce our enterprise fair value below its book value these events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate including a significant sustained decline in an entity’s market value legal factors operating performance indicators competition sale or disposition of a significant portion of the business or other factors if the fair market value is less than the carrying value including goodwill we could be required to record an impairment charge the valuation of reporting units requires judgment in estimating future cash flows discount rates and estimated product life cycles in making these judgments we evaluate the financial health of the business including such factors as industry performance changes in technology and operating cash flows as we have grown through acquisitions the amount of goodwill and net acquired intangible assets is a significant portion of our total assets as a result the amount of any annual or interim impairment could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our reported financial results for the period in which the charge is taken we also may be required to record an earnings charge or incur unanticipated expenses if as a result of a change in strategy or other reason we were to determine the value of other assets had been impaired 

united states and global responses to terrorism concerns regarding nuclear proliferation and the safety of nuclear energy continuing turmoil in middle eastern countries increasing tension between the us and russia potential hostilities involving north korea potential epidemics potential future financial issues impacting airlines and volatile energy prices increase uncertainties with respect to many of our businesses and may adversely affect our business and results of operations 

united states’ and global responses to terrorism continuing turmoil in middle eastern countries and nuclear proliferation concerns increase uncertainties with respect to us and other business and financial markets and could adversely affect our business and operations increasing tensions with russia or the evolving nuclear threat from north korea could disrupt the global economic recovery 

air travel declines have occurred after terrorist attacks and heightened security alerts as well as after the highprofile outbreaks of disease travel by our sales and service personnel to various regions has been affected by such factors additional declines in air travel resulting from such factors and other factors could adversely affect the financial condition of many of our commercial airline and aircraft manufacturer customers and in turn could adversely affect our aerospace and defense electronics segment terrorist attacks in spain in 2017 and paris in 2015 or the syrian refugee crisis could result in governments in europe imposing greater restrictions on the movement of personnel or goods which could adversely impact our businesses located within the european union or our ability to sell products in that region in addition a prolonged virus epidemic or pandemic or the threat thereof could result in worker absences lower productivity voluntary closure of our offices and manufacturing facilities disruptions in our supply chain travel restrictions on our employees and other disruptions to our businesses moreover health epidemics may force local health and government authorities to mandate the temporary closure of our offices and manufacturing facilities 

a future deterioration of financial performance of airlines could result in a reduction of discretionary spending for upgrades of avionics and inflight communications equipment which would adversely affect our aerospace and defense electronics segment 

higher oil prices could adversely affect commercial airlinerelated customers of our aerospace and defense electronics segment conversely lower oil prices have decreased oil exploration and petrochemical refining activities and have hindered our marine and other instrumentation businesses in addition instability in the middle east or other oilproducing regions could adversely affect expansion plans of the oil and gas industry customers of our instrumentation and cable solutions businesses 

our revenue from government contracts subjects us to many risks 

our revenue from us government contracts depends on the continued availability of funding from the us government and accordingly we have the risk that funding for our existing contracts may be canceled or diverted to other uses or delayed 

we perform work on a number of contracts with the us department of defense and other agencies and departments of the us government including subcontracts with government prime contractors sales under contracts with the us government as a whole including sales under contracts with the us department of defense as prime contractor or subcontractor represented approximately 24  of our total revenue in 2017  compared with 27  in 2016  and 26  in 2015  performance under government contracts has inherent risks that could have a material effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

government contracts are conditioned upon the continuing availability of congressional appropriations and the failure of congress to appropriate funds for programs in which we participate could negatively affect our results of operations the us government shutdown during 2013 negatively affected many of our businesses and the failure by congress to approve future budgets on a timely basis could delay procurement of our products and services and cause us to lose future revenues any renewed emphasis on federal deficit and debt reduction could lead to a further decrease in overall defense spending the continued war on terrorism also could result in a diversion of funds from programs in which teledyne participates budgetary concerns could result in future contracts being awarded more on price than on other competitive factors and smaller defense budgets could result in government insourcing of programs and more intense competition on programs that are not insourced which could result in lower revenues and profits 

the sequestration provision of the budget control act of 2011 originally imposed 5000 billion of defense cuts over nine years starting in fiscal year 2013 which represented approximately 9 of planned defense funding over the period on november 2 2015 the bipartisan budget act of 2015 the “budget act” was signed into law the budget act raises the statutory limit on the amount of permissible federal debt the debt ceiling until march 2017 and raises the sequester caps imposed by the budget control act of 2011 by 800 billion split equally between defense and domestic spending 500 billion in government fiscal year 2016 and 300 billion in government fiscal year 2017 the president signed a continuing resolution in september 2016 which was extended in december 2016 and provided funding for the us government at fiscal 

2016 levels through april 28 2017 in may 2017 the president signed the consolidated appropriations act of 2017 for appropriations through september 30 2017 congress has yet to pass a budget for the us government’s fiscal year 2018 but to date the government has continued to operate through continuing resolutions uncertainty around the budget process delays new programs the total statutory spending cap remains at 11 trillion as set by the relief authorized in 2016 and 2017 by the bipartisan budget act of 2015 to the original sequestration specified by the budget act of 2011 which set discretionary caps through 2021 

although the president has indicated his desire for increased defense spending continued defense spending does not necessarily correlate to continued business for us because not all of the programs in which we participate or have current capabilities may be provided with continued funding changes in policy and budget priorities by the president his administration and the us congress for various defense and nasa programs could continue to impact our engineered systems aerospace and defense electronics and digital imaging segments for example changes in national space policy that affect nasa’s budget have occurred there have also been significant reductions in missile defense budgets our turbine engines business which is part of our engineered systems segment is being impacted by delays in production runs under the harpoon missile programs and may be impacted by us department of defense directives to introduce competitive bidding for programs on which we have previously served as sole source the jassm missile program comes to an end in mid2018 the president has expressed concern over the cost of the f35 joint strike fighter program our aerospace and defense electronics segment may be impacted by volume andor price reductions in connection with this program to the extent they are imposed the timing of program cycles can affect our results of operations for a particular quarter or year and cancellations of significant programs such as the objective simulation framework “osf” littoral combat ship gun mission modules or the shallow water combat submersible “swcs” would affect our results it is also not uncommon for the us department of defense to delay the timing of awards for major programs for six to twelve months reductions and delays in research and development funding by the us government may continue to impact our revenues as darpa reviews its programs aimed to technologically enhance us military capabilities and national security changes to the darpa research and technology development programs in which we participate could occur uncertainty over budgets or priorities with the presidential administration could result in delays in funding changes in funded programs and the timing of awards that could have a material impact on our revenues in 2018 finally various us department of defense initiatives such as the emphasis on insourcing positions to the government and anticipated reductions or cancellations of existing programs could negatively impact our engineered systems segment 

our participation in government programs may decrease or be subject to renegotiation as those programs evolve over time 

the us government has been placing emphasis on small business quotas and increasing small business contract set asides and minimum work percentages in some cases prime contractors are required to reduce participation by large subcontractors like teledyne in order to fill small business quotas and be responsive to proposals and bids as a result our engineered systems segment could be significantly impacted 

over time and for a variety of reasons programs can evolve and affect the extent of our participation we have been a significant participant in nasa programs primarily through our engineered systems segment and through teledyne scientific company the prior administration introduced significant changes to the national space policy including the cancellation of the nasa’s constellation program which includes ares launch vehicles teledyne brown engineering has developed the multi user system for earth sensing “muses” platform as part of our commercial space business the muses platform provides opportunities for imaging technology demonstrations and space qualification of payloads supporting research scientific studies humanitarian efforts for both government and commercial customers the muses platform depends on continued operation of the iss and we may not be successful in developing the technology or commercial relationships necessary to make this investment profitable while muses is now operational on the iss the delay in launch of equipment for use on the muses platform could have an adverse impact on the investment return on the platform the launch of muses was delayed in 2017 by launch failures of spacex future launch failures could impact future instruments designed for this platform in early 2014 we were awarded a fiveyear 600 million contract by nasa’s marshall space flight center to develop and manufacture the launch vehicle stage adapter for the space launch system but failure to further transition our business successfully could result in reduced sales in addition delayed funding and changes in support for nasa’s current space policy could negatively impact our business the presidential administration could also lead to changes to the nation’s space policy some or all of which could materially impact our results 

our contracts with the us government are subject to termination rights that could adversely affect us 

most of our us government contracts are subject to termination by the us government either at its convenience or upon the default of the contractor termination for convenience provisions provide only for the recovery of costs incurred or committed settlement expenses and profit on work completed prior to termination termination for default clauses impose liability on the contractor for excess costs incurred by the us government in reprocuring undelivered items from another source we had nine  us government contracts terminated for convenience in 2017  compared with one  in 2016  and eight  in 

2015  no contracts were terminated for default during such threeyear period 

we may lose money or generate less than expected profits on our fixedprice and other government contracts and we may lose money if we fail to meet certain prespecified targets in government contracts 

there is no guarantee that us government contracts will be profitable a number of our us government prime contracts and subcontracts are fixedprice type contracts  58  of our total us government contracts were fixedprice in 2017  54  in 2016  and 54  in 2015  under these types of contracts we bear the inherent risk that actual performance cost may exceed the fixed contract price under such contracts we must absorb cost overruns notwithstanding the difficulty of estimating all of the costs we will incur in performing these contracts we cannot assure that our contract loss provisions in our financial statements will be adequate to cover all actual future losses we may lose money or generate lower profits on some contracts if we fail to meet these estimates we may also lose money on nonfixed price costreimbursement contracts that contain disincentives or penalties related to cost schedule or performance 

our business is subject to government contracting regulations including increasingly complex regulations on cybersecurity and our failure to comply with such laws and regulations could harm our operating results and prospects 

we like other government contractors are subject to various audits reviews and investigations including private party “whistleblower” lawsuits relating to our compliance with federal and state laws more routinely the us government may audit the costs we incur on our us government contracts including allocated indirect costs such audits could result in adjustments to our contract costs any costs found to be improperly allocated to a specific contract will not be reimbursed and such costs already reimbursed would need to be refunded we have recorded contract revenues based upon costs we expect to realize on final audit in a worst case scenario should a business or division involved be charged with wrongdoing or should the us government determine that the business or division is not a “presently responsible contractor” that business or division and conceivably our company as a whole could be temporarily suspended or in the event of a conviction could be debarred for up to three years from receiving new government contracts or governmentapproved subcontracts in addition we could expend substantial amounts defending against such charges and in damages fines and penalties if such charges were proven or were to result in negotiated settlements the department of defense as well as other us government contracting agencies have adopted new rules and regulations requiring contractors to implement a set of cyber security measures to attain the safeguarding of contractor systems that process store or transmit certain information implementation and compliance with these new cyber security requirements is complex and costly and could result in unforeseen expenses lower profitability and in the case of noncompliance penalties and damages all of which could have an adverse effect on our business 

our pension expense and the value of our pension assets are affected by factors outside of our control including the performance of plan assets the stock market interest rates and actuarial experience 

we have a domestic qualified defined benefit pension plan covering most of our us employees hired prior to 2004 or approximately 13  of our active employees we also have several smaller domestic and foreignbased pension plans as of december 31 2017 the value of the combined pension assets is greater than our combined pension benefit obligations the accounting rules applicable to our pension plans require that amounts recognized in the financial statements be determined on an actuarial basis rather than as contributions are made to the plan two significant elements in determining our pension income or pension expense are the expected return on plan assets and the discount rate used in projecting pension benefit obligations declines in the stock market and lower rates of return could increase required contributions to our qualified pension plan andor result in a change to shareholders’ equity our investment strategy may not produce the expected returns if the credit financial or stock markets deteriorate any decreases or increases in market interest rates will affect the discount rate assumption used in projecting pension benefit obligations in addition changes in other actuarial assumptions such as mortality assumptions or change due to legislative or regulatory actions could impact our pension income or expense as well as funding obligations each year beginning with 2014 the society of actuaries released revised mortality tables which updated life expectancy assumptions in consideration of these tables each year we review the mortality assumptions used in determining our pension and postretirement benefit obligations the impact of these mortality assumptions could increase our pension obligation and increase future pension expense in 2013 we made a voluntary pretax cash contribution of 830 million  to the domestic pension plan no contributions were made to the domestic pension plan since the 2013 contribution if and to the extent decreases in our pension assets are not offset by voluntary contributions recovered through future asset returns mitigated by an increase in the rate at which the benefit obligation is discounted or other actions our required cash contributions and pension expense could increase under the plans in addition we have sold approximately 461 million in pension liability to third parties in recent years to the extent any of these counterparties are unable to fulfill their obligations to retirees we may have residual liability for additional discussion of pension matters see the discussion under “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition” and notes 2 and 11 to our notes to consolidated financial statements 

our business and operations could suffer in the event of cyber security breaches 

attempts by others to gain unauthorized access to our information technology systems have become more sophisticated and are sometimes successful these attempts which might be related to industrial or foreign government espionage activism or other motivations include covertly introducing malware to our computers and networks performing reconnaissance impersonating authorized users stealing corrupting or restricting our access to data among other activities we continue to update our infrastructure security tools and processes to protect against security incidents including both external and internal threats and to prevent their recurrence company personnel and third parties have been tasked to detect and investigate such incidents but it is possible that we might not prevent or be aware of an incident or its magnitude and effects the theft corruption unauthorized use or publication of our intellectual property andor confidential business information could harm our competitive position reduce the value of our investment in research and development and other strategic initiatives or otherwise adversely affect our business we are subject to us department of defense regulations applicable to certain types of data residing on or transiting through certain information systems and we expect these regulations will be incorporated into certain contracts we hold to the extent that any security breach results in inappropriate disclosure of confidential or controlled information of employees third parties or the us government or any of the deployed security controls are deemed insufficient we may incur liability or the loss of contracts or security clearances as a result in addition we expect to continue devoting additional resources to the security of our information technology systems more resources may be required in the defense arena to the extent the us government increases its cyber security mandates unauthorized access to or control of our products devices or systems could impact the safely or our customers and other third parties which could result in legal claims against us security breaches also could result in a violation of applicable us and international privacy and other laws including the gdpr and subject us to private consumer or securities litigation and governmental investigations and proceedings any of which could result in our exposure to material civil or criminal liability 

we may not have sufficient resources to fund all future research and development and capital expenditures or possible acquisitions 

in order to remain competitive we must make substantial investments in research and development of new or enhanced products and continuously upgrade our process technology and manufacturing capabilities our teledyne scientific company subsidiary which serves as our primary research center has been actively promoting and funding joint research and development projects with other teledyne businesses including our teledyne oil  gas businesses teledyne reynolds inc teledyne brown engineering inc dalsa and lecroy the business of teledyne e2v for which the design and development of specialized technology for high performance systems and equipment is integral also requires substantial investments in research and development additionally some of our businesses are actively pursuing governmental support and funding for some of their research and development initiatives including dalsa with respect to its cmos and uncooled infrared image sensor development efforts as well as the expansion of dalsa’s semiconductor foundry in bromont quebec nonetheless we may be unable to fund all of our research and development and capital investment needs or possible acquisitions our ability to raise additional capital will depend on a variety of factors some of which will not be within our control including the existence of bank and capital markets investor perceptions of us our businesses and the industries in which we operate and general economic conditions failure to successfully raise needed capital or generate cash flow on a timely or costeffective basis could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition in addition if we fail to accurately predict future customer needs and preferences or fail to produce viable technologies we may invest heavily in research and development of products that do not lead to significant revenue which would adversely affect our profitability 

limitations in customer funding for applied research and development and technology insertion projects and government support for research and development expenditures may reduce our ability to apply our ongoing investments in some market areas 

we may be unable to successfully introduce new and enhanced products in a timely and costeffective manner or increase our participation in new markets which could harm our profitability and prospects 

our operating results depend in part on our ability to introduce new and enhanced products on a timely basis in order to improve our product development capabilities we purchased the research center that is now teledyne scientific company in 2006 and in 2011 we purchased dalsa which has access to a wellequipped mems research and development center in 2013 we opened a 52000squarefoot technology development center in daytona beach florida primarily to serve the offshore oil and gas production and exploration industries we are currently upgrading infrastructure at teledyne e2v’s facility in chelmsford uk and subject to customer and governmental support we are planning to expand teledyne dalsa’s mems foundry in bromont quebec successful product development and introduction depend on numerous factors including our ability to anticipate customer and market requirements changes in technology and industry standards our ability to differentiate our offerings from offerings of our competitors and market acceptance we may not be able to develop and introduce new or enhanced products in a timely and costeffective manner or to develop and introduce products that satisfy customer requirements 

our new products also may not achieve market acceptance or correctly address new industry standards and technological changes we may also lose any technological advantage to competitors if we fail to develop new products in a timely manner 

additionally new products may trigger increased warranty costs as information on such products is augmented by actual usage accelerated entry of new products to meet heightened market demand and competitive pressures may cause additional warranty costs as development and testing time periods might be accelerated or condensed 

we intend to both adapt our existing technologies and develop new products to expand into new market segments we may be unsuccessful in accessing these and other new markets if our products do not meet our customers’ requirements as a result of changes in either technology and industry standards or because of actions taken by our competitors 

technological change and evolving industry and regulatory standards could cause some of our products or services to become obsolete or noncompetitive 

the markets for some of our products and services are characterized by rapid technological development evolving industry standards changes in customer requirements and new product introductions and enhancements a faster than anticipated change in one or more of the technologies related to our products or services or in market demand for products or services based on a particular technology could result in faster than anticipated obsolescence of certain of our products or services and could lead to reduced sales of those products which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition currently accepted industry and regulatory standards are also subject to change which may contribute to the obsolescence of our products or services failure to comply ce marking directives may prevent some of our products from being sold into europe and the cost to comply with these directives may make our products noncompetitive the political agenda of the presidential administration may affect the level of environmental regulations and enforcement and government spending on scientific research which could adversely impact the sales of our products and services including sales of pollution monitoring instruments and instruments used to measure the earth’s climate and climate change such as undersea gliders and spacebased imaging sensors a change in chinas recent economic policies promoting pollution reduction could result in lower sales or slower sales growth for our pollution monitoring and laboratory instrumentation to that country 

we may not be able to reduce the costs of our products to satisfy customers’ cost reduction mandates which could harm our sales or margins 

more and more customers continue to seek price reductions of our products while we continually work to reduce our manufacturing and other costs of our products without affecting product quality and reliability there is no assurance that we will be able to do so and do so in a timely manner to satisfy the pricing pressures of our customers cost reductions of raw materials and other components used in our products may be beyond our control depending on market conditions customers may seek lower cost products from china and other developing countries where manufacturing costs are lower 

the airline industry is heavily regulated and if we fail to comply with applicable requirements our results of operations could suffer 

governmental agencies throughout the world including the us federal aviation administration or the faa prescribe standards and qualification requirements for aircraft components including virtually all commercial airline and general aviation products specific regulations vary from country to country although compliance with faa requirements generally satisfies regulatory requirements in other countries if any material authorization or approval qualifying us to supply our products is revoked or suspended then the sale of the product would be prohibited by law which would have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

from time to time the faa or equivalent regulatory agencies in other countries propose new regulations or changes to existing regulations which are usually more stringent than existing regulations if these proposed regulations are adopted and enacted we may incur significant additional costs to achieve compliance which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations recent trends by china’s aviation authority to relax restrictions on airspace may be reversed and anticipated new regulations loosening airspace restrictions may not materialize which could impact the future prospects of our commercial aerospace businesses 

  increasing competition could reduce the demand for our products and services 

each of our markets is highly competitive many of our competitors have and potential competitors could have greater name recognition a larger installed base of products more extensive engineering manufacturing marketing and distribution capabilities and greater financial technological and personnel resources than we do new or existing competitors may also develop new technologies that could adversely affect the demand for our products and services in particular we face increased competition with respect to the sale of our flight data acquisition systems which may intensify as certain of our patents related to these products expire in 2018 and upcoming years we also face new competition for our protocol analyzers products industry acquisition and consolidation trends particularly among aerospace and defense contractors have adversely impacted demand for our aerospace and defense related engineering services as large prime contractors insource increased amounts of 

major acquisition programs and also require significant expansion in small business participation to meet government contracting goals lowcost competition from china and other developing countries could also result in decreased demand for our products increasing competition could reduce the volume of our sales or the prices we may charge which would negatively impact our revenues smaller defense budgets both in the united states and europe could result in additional competition for new and existing defense programs 

product liability claims product recalls and field service actions could have a material adverse effect on our reputation business results of operations and financial condition and we may have difficulty obtaining product liability and other insurance coverage 

as a manufacturer and distributor of a wide variety of products including monitoring instruments products used in offshore oil and gas production products used in transportation and commercial aviation and products used in medical devices most recently including xray detectors and generators our results of operations are susceptible to adverse publicity regarding the quality or safety of our products in part product liability claims challenging the safety of our products may result in a decline in sales for a particular product which could adversely affect our results of operations this could be the case even if the claims themselves are proven untrue or settled for immaterial amounts 

while we have general liability and other insurance policies concerning product liabilities we have selfinsured retentions or deductibles under such policies with respect to a portion of these liabilities awarded damages could be more than our accruals we could incur losses above the aggregate annual policy limit as well we cannot assure that for 2018 and in future years insurance carriers will be willing to renew coverage or provide new coverage for product liability 

product recalls can be expensive and tarnish our reputation and have a material adverse effect on the sales of our products we cannot assure that we will not have additional product liability claims or that we will not recall any products 

we have been joined among a number of defendants often over 100 in lawsuits alleging injury or death as a result of exposure to asbestos in addition because of the prominent “teledyne” name we may continue to be mistakenly joined in lawsuits involving a company or business that was not assumed by us as part of our 1999 spinoff to date we have not incurred material liabilities in connection with these lawsuits however our historic insurance coverage including that of its predecessors may not fully cover such claims and the defense of such matters coverage typically depends on the year of purported exposure and other factors nonetheless we intend to vigorously defend our position against these claims 

certain gas generators historically manufactured by teledyne energy systems inc contained a sealed wetted asbestos component while the company has transitioned to a replacement material had placed warning labels on its products and took care in the handling of this discontinued material by employees there is no assurance that the company will not face product liability or workers ’  compensation claims involving this component 

our teledyne brown engineering inc’s laboratory in knoxville tennessee performs radiological analyses our teledyne dalsa professional imaging unit develops image sensors used in medical and dental xray applications along with portable xray generators used in nondestructive testing and security applications in addition our teledyne dalsa digital imaging unit develops equipment and sensors used in eye examination and general surgical vision applications errors and omissions in analyses may occur or erroneous images could be captured our insurance coverage or indemnities may not be adequate to cover potential problems associated with faulty radiological analyses 

teledyne brown engineering inc and other teledyne companies manufacture components for customers in the nuclear power market including utilities and certain governmental entities certain liabilities associated with such products are covered by the priceanderson nuclear industries indemnity act and other statutory and common law defenses and we have received indemnities from some of our customers however there is no assurance we will not face product liability claims related to such products or that our exposure will not exceed the amounts for which we have liability coverage or protection 

our business and financial results could be adversely affected by conditions and other factors associated with our suppliers 

some items we purchase for the manufacture of our products are purchased from limited or single sources of supply due to technical capability price and other factors for example dalsa has a single source of supply for ccd semiconductor wafers used to assemble image sensors and an external single source of supply for cmos semiconductor wafers used to assemble xray panel products lecroy continues to outsource a portion of its research and development activities to a third party engineering firm in malaysia where it may be more difficult for us to enforce our intellectual property rights we have also outsourced from time to time the manufacturing of certain parts components subsystems and even finished products to single or limited sources including international sources disruption of these sources or supplierimposed rationing of scarce components could cause delays or reductions in shipments of our products or increases in our costs which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or operations international sources possess additional risks some of which are similar to those described above in regard to international sales with any continuing disruption in the global economy and financial markets some of our suppliers may also continue to face issues gaining access to sufficient credit and materials to 

maintain their businesses which could reduce the availability of some components and to the extent such suppliers are single source suppliers could adversely affect our ability to continue to manufacture and sell our products continuing economic pressure on suppliers may also trigger increased pricing or workforce reductions or reduced workweeks and a shrinking supply base possibly creating longer lead times to obtain needed components for our products delays in material acceptance and a greater risk of receiving counterfeit parts 

some of our commercial product lines may have one or a limited number of customers the loss of which could adversely affect our business or financial results 

while no commercial customer accounted for more than 10 of our total sales during 2017  2016  and 2015  and we have hundreds of customers in the various industries that we serve some of our product lines may have one or a few key customers the loss of which could adversely affect our business or financial results in 2017  2016 or 2015 no commercial customer accounted for more than 30  of total sales 

newer products such as our xray generators and xray panel products may initially be more heavily dependent on a singular or limited number of customers until market acceptance is obtained or due to contractual terms similarly some older product lines may be more heavily dependent on a singular or limited number of customers in either such case program delays of such customer or customers as well as the loss of such customer or customers could adversely affect our business or financial results 

weaker demand for coal and gasfired power plants as evidenced by recent restructurings at power asset divisions of general electric and siemens could result in lower sales of our instruments systems and services for liquid and air analysis process management and emissions compliance 

we face risks related to sales through distributors and other third parties that we do not control which could harm our business 

we sell a portion of our products through third parties such as distributors valueadded resellers and oems collectively “distributors” using third parties for distribution exposes teledyne to many risks including concentration credit risk and compliance risks we may rely on one or more key distributors for a product and the loss of these distributors could reduce our revenue distributors may face financial difficulties including bankruptcy which could harm our collection of accounts receivables and financial results violations of the fcpa or similar antibribery laws by distributors or other third party intermediaries could have a material impact on our business competitors could also block our access to key distributors failing to manage risks related to our use of distributors may reduce sales increase expenses and weaken our competitive position and could result in sanctions against us 

compliance with increasing environmental and climate change regulations as well as the effects of potential environmental liabilities could have a material adverse financial effect on us 

we like other industry participants are subject to various federal state local and international environmental laws and regulations we may be subject to increasingly stringent environmental standards in the future particularly as greenhouse gas emissions and climate change regulations and initiatives increase future developments administrative actions or liabilities relating to environmental and climate change matters could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition environmental regulations on hydraulic fracturing and the use of seismic energy sources for offshore energy exploration could adversely affect some product lines of our instrumentation segment 

our manufacturing operations including former operations could expose us to material environmental liabilities additionally companies we acquire may have environmental liabilities that are not accurately assessed or brought to our attention at the time of the acquisition 

the us environmental protection agency “epa” has focused on greenhouse gases “ghgs” maintaining ghgs threaten the public health and welfare of the american people the epa also maintains that ghg emissions from onroad vehicles contribute to that threat the epa’s endangerment finding covers emissions of six greenhouse gases the epa’s continuing efforts to limit ghg emissions could adversely affect our us manufacturing operations increase prices for energy fuel and transportation require us to accommodate changes in parameters such as the way parts are manufactured and may in some cases require us to redesign certain of our products this or other federal or state regulations could lead to increased costs which we may not be able to recover from customers delays in product shipments and loss of market share to competitors 

for additional discussion of environmental matters see the discussion under the caption “other matters  environmental” of “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of results of operation and financial condition” and note 14 to our notes to consolidated financial statements 

our inability to attract and retain key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our future success 

our future success depends to a significant extent upon the continued service of our executive officers and other key management and technical personnel and on our ability to continue to attract retain and motivate qualified personnel we also have a maturing workforce some of our businesses including those in traveling wave tube design and development draw from a pool of specialized engineering talent that is small and currently shrinking while we have engaged in succession planning the loss of the services of one or more of our key employees or our failure to attract retain and motivate qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we may not be able to sell exit or reconfigure businesses facilities or product lines that we determine no longer meet with our growth strategy or that should be consolidated 

consistent with our strategy to emphasize growth in our core markets we continually evaluate our businesses to ensure that they are aligned with our strategy this review led to the decision to sell the net assets of the printed circuit technology “pct” business in 2016 and the general aviation piston engine businesses in 2011 over the years we have also consolidated some of our business units and facilities including to deal with downturns in the defense and oil and gas industries among other reasons in 2015 we began to consolidate some of our marine instrumentation businesses units and facilities and it continued through 2017 the operations of teledyne cormon are currently being relocated from the united kingdom to daytona beach florida in 2017 we closed our remaining relays operations in tijuana mexico and relocated them to our owned teledyne relays’ facility in hawthorne california we may not be able to realize efficiencies and cost savings from our consolidation activities there is no assurance that our efforts will be successful if we do not successfully manage our current consolidation activities or any other similar activities that we may undertake in the future expected efficiencies and benefits might be delayed or not realized and our operations and business could be disrupted our ability to dispose of exit or reconfigure businesses that may no longer be aligned with our growth strategy will depend on many factors including the terms and conditions of any asset purchase and sale agreement as well as industry business and economic conditions we cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to sell nonstrategic businesses on terms that are acceptable to us or at all in addition if the sale of any nonstrategic business cannot be consummated or is not practical alternative courses of action including relocation of product lines or closure may not be available to us or may be more costly than anticipated 

natural and manmade disasters could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

several of our facilities as a result of their locations could be subject to a catastrophic loss caused by earthquakes hurricanes tornados floods ice storms or other natural disasters many of our production facilities and our headquarters are located in california and thus are in areas with above average seismic activity and may also be at risk of damage in wildfires teledyne dalsa’s semiconductor facilities in quebec canada have been impacted by loss of electrical power caused by severe ice storms in addition we have manufacturing facilities in the southeastern united states and texas that have been threatened and struck by major hurricanes in 2017 our businesses located in houston were impacted by hurricane harvey and our business in florida was threatened by hurricanes irma and matthew our facilities in alabama florida nebraska tennessee and virginia have also been threatened by tornados in june 2012 a tornado caused substantial damage to and interrupted business at our teledyne hastings instruments facility in hampton virginia if any of our california facilities including our california headquarters were to experience a catastrophic earthquake or wildfire loss or if any of our alabama florida louisiana nebraska tennessee or texas facilities were to experience a catastrophic hurricane storm tornado or other natural disaster or if dalsa’s facilities in quebec experience longterm loss of electrical power such event could disrupt our operations delay production shipments and revenue and result in large expenses to repair or replace the facility or facilities while teledyne has property insurance to partially reimburse it for losses caused by windstorm and earth movement such insurance would not cover all possible losses in addition our existing disaster recovery and business continuity plans including those relating to our information technology systems may not be fully responsive to or minimize losses associated with catastrophic events 

the environmental disaster triggered by the deepwater horizon rig explosion and oil spill in 2010 resulted in a moratorium on offshore oil and gas production in the gulf of mexico that adversely affected the results of operations of some of our teledyne oil and gas businesses although such adverse impact was offset in part by the products we manufacture that supported wellcapping and environmental cleanup efforts environmental regulations enacted in the wake of the deepwater horizon rig explosion and oil spill in 2010 have resulted in increased compliance costs to some of our teledyne oil and gas businesses similar future manmade disasters that limit or cease offshore oil and gas production or further exploration in the regions in which we sell our products could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

disasters that do not directly impact us can have an indirect adverse impact on our business for example in 2011 the earthquake in northern japan and the related tsunami and severe flooding in thailand resulted in certain of our customers delaying orders for our products because they were unable to obtain critical supplies from vendors in the impacted areas 

teledyne brown engineering inc has developed built and launched a multi user system for earth sensing that is affixed to the iss for the program to be financially successful the 19 yearold iss must continue to fly in a safe and human tended condition while certain spaceflight risks such as a highvelocity debris impact to the station causing significant structural damage or necessitating the evacuation of the iss have been regarded as small if such event were to occur the iss program continuation could be threatened jeopardizing our investment and potential revenue generation from issbased earth imaging 

we may not be able to enforce or protect our intellectual property rights or third parties may claim infringement of their intellectual rights each which may harm our ability to compete and thus harm our business 

our ability to enforce and protect our patents copyrights software licenses trade secrets knowhow and other intellectual property rights is subject to general litigation risks as well as uncertainty as to the enforceability of our intellectual property rights in various countries when we seek to enforce our rights we have found that various claims may be asserted against us including claims that our intellectual property right is invalid is otherwise not enforceable or is licensed to the party against whom we are asserting a claim in addition we may be the target of aggressive and opportunistic enforcement of patents by third parties if we are not ultimately successful in defending ourselves against these claims in litigation we may not be able to sell a particular product or family of products due to an injunction or we may have to pay damages that could in turn harm our results of operations our inability to enforce our intellectual property rights under these circumstances may harm our competitive position and our business 

higher tax rates may harm our results of operations and cash flow 

our effective tax rate for 2017  was 208 compared with 209  for 2016  and 243  for 2015  while in december 2017 the president signed the tax cuts and jobs act which in general lowers corporate tax rates in the united states a number of factors may impact our effective tax rates which could reduce our net income and increase our tax payments including 

 our inability to efficiently implement changes to our enterprise resource planning software could result in higher than expected costs or otherwise adversely impact our internal controls environment operations and profitability 

we continue to implement enterprise resource planning software systems which are intended to improve our business processes in certain business units the costs associated with such systems can be significant and we could incur costs in excess of budgeted costs any technical or other difficulties in developing or implementing this initiative may increase the costs of the project and have an adverse effect on our operations and reporting processes including our internal controls over financial reporting as we make adjustments to operations as a result of this project we may incur incremental expenses prior to realizing the benefits of a more efficient workforce and operating structure although implementation has occurred in only selected business units to date and efforts have been made to minimize adverse impacts on our controls we cannot assure that all such impacts have been mitigated further we may not realize anticipated cost improvements and greater efficiencies from the project 

our financial statements are based on estimates required by generally accepted accounting principles in the united states “gaap” and actual results may differ materially from those estimated under different assumptions or conditions 

our financial statements are prepared in conformity with gaap these principles require our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period for example estimates are used when accounting for items such as asset valuations allowances for doubtful accounts allowance for excess and obsolete inventory depreciation and amortization impairment assessments employee benefits taxes recall and warranty costs product and general liability and contingencies while we base our estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances at the time made actual results may differ materially from those estimated our most critical accounting estimates are described in the management discussion in this form 10k under “critical accounting estimates” 

while we believe our internal control systems are effective there are inherent limitations in all control systems and misstatements resulting from error or fraud may occur and may not be detected 

we continue to take action to assure compliance with the internal controls disclosure controls and other requirements of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer cannot guarantee that our internal controls and disclosure controls will prevent all possible errors or all fraud a control system no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met in addition the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefit of controls must be relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no system of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within the company have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake further controls can be circumvented by individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more persons or by management override of the controls the design of any system of controls is also based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions over time a control may be inadequate because of changes in conditions or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate because of inherent limitations in a costeffective control system misstatements resulting from error or fraud may occur and may not be detected 

provisions of our governing documents applicable law and our change in control severance agreements could make an acquisition of teledyne more difficult 

our restated certificate of incorporation our amended and restated bylaws and the general corporation law of the state of delaware contain several provisions that could make the acquisition of control of teledyne in a transaction not approved by our board of directors more difficult we have also entered into change in control severance agreements with ten members of our current management which could have an antitakeover effect these provisions may prevent or discourage attempts to acquire our company 

the market price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly since we became a public company and could continue to do so 

since we became an independent public company on november 29 1999 the market price of our common stock has fluctuated substantially and fluctuations in our stock price could continue in fiscal 2015 our stock price declined 152 and in fiscal 2016 our stock increased 387 while in 2017 our stock price increased 473 additional information regarding our historical stock price is set forth in part ii item 5 of this annual report on form 10k 

among the factors that could affect our stock price are 

 the stock markets in general and the markets for hightechnology companies in particular have experienced a high degree of volatility that is not necessarily related to the operating performance of these companies we cannot provide assurances as to our stock price we have in the past repurchased shares of our stock pursuant to boardapproved stock repurchase programs we cannot provide assurances that we will continue to repurchase shares under those programs or that our board will authorize new repurchase programs

financial condition liquidity and capital resources 

principal capital requirements 

our principal cash and capital requirements are to fund working capital needs capital expenditures income tax payments and debt service requirements as well as acquisitions we may also deploy cash for the stock repurchase program it is anticipated that operating cash flow together with available borrowings under the credit facility described below will be sufficient to meet these requirements and could be used to fund acquisitions in 2018 to support acquisitions we may need to raise additional capital our liquidity is not dependent upon the use of offbalance sheet financial arrangements we have no offbalance sheet financing arrangements that incorporate the use of special purpose or unconsolidated entities 

credit facility senior notes and term loans 

in march 2017 teledyne entered into a 1000 million term loan with a maturity date of october 30 2019 subsequently in march 2017 teledyne entered into a cross currency swap to effectively convert the 1000 million term loan to a €930 million denominated instrument with a fixed euro interest rate of 07055 the proceeds from the term loan were used in connection with the acquisition of e2v on april 18 2017 teledyne entered into a note purchase agreement for a private placement of €2500 million of senior unsecured notes due through april 2024 teledyne used the proceeds of this private placement note issuance among other things to repay indebtedness and for general corporate purposes in september 2017 teledyne repaid the 1000 million 474 fixed rate senior notes at their maturity 

in december 2016 the company entered into an amendment relating to unsecured term loans of 1825 million in aggregate principal amount the “term loans” to extend the maturity date of the term loans from march 2019 to january 2022 and extending the date on which amortization of principal begins and generally lowering the applicable rate for base rate and eurocurrency loans the other material terms of the term loans including covenants remain unchanged in november 2015 the company issued 1250 million  in aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes “senior unsecured notes” the notes consisted of 250 million of 281 senior unsecured notes due in november 2020 and 1000 million of 328 senior unsecured notes due in november 2022 also in december 2015 the company amended the 7500 million unsecured credit facility “credit facility” to extend the maturity from march 2018 to december 2020 excluding interest and fees no payments are due under the credit facility until it matures borrowings under our credit facility and term loans are at variable rates which are at our option tied to a eurocurrency rate equal to libor london interbank offered rate plus an applicable rate or a base rate as defined in our credit agreements eurocurrency rate loans may be denominated in us dollars or an alternative currency as defined in the agreement eurocurrency or libor based loans under the facility typically have terms of one two three or six months and the interest rate for each such loan is subject to change if the loan is continued or converted following the applicable maturity date the company has not drawn any loans with a term longer than three months under the credit facility base rate loans have interest rates that primarily fluctuate with changes in the prime rate interest rates are also subject to change based on our consolidated leverage ratio as defined in the credit agreement the credit facility also provides for facility fees that vary between 012 and 025 of the credit line depending on our consolidated leverage ratio as calculated from time to time 



at december 31 2017  we had 67 million  in capital leases of which 13 million  is current and had 296 million  in outstanding letters of credit 

our credit facility senior notes and term loans agreements require the company to comply with various financial and operating covenants including maintaining certain consolidated leverage and interest coverage ratios as well as minimum net worth levels and limits on acquired debt at december 31 2017  the company was in compliance with these covenants and we had a significant amount of margin between required financial covenant ratios and our actual ratios currently we do not believe our ability to undertake additional debt financing if needed is reasonably likely to be materially impacted by debt restrictions under our credit agreements subject to our complying with required financial covenants listed in the table below 

financial covenant ratios and the actual ratios at december 31 2017    





in the event of an acquisition our debt instruments permit us at our option to exceed the consolidated leverage ratio of 325 to 1 for up to four quarters following the fiscal quarter in which the acquisition event occurs provided that the consolidated leverage ratio does not exceed 35 to 1 

available borrowing capacity under the 7500 million credit facility which is reduced by borrowings and outstanding letters of credit was 5587 million  at december 31 2017  

teledyne also has a 50 million uncommitted credit line which permits credit extensions up to 50 million plus an incremental 20 million solely for standby letters of credit this credit line is utilized as needed for periodic cash needs at december 31 2017  no amounts were outstanding under this credit line at january 1 2017 35 million was outstanding under the credit line 

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our expected cash outflows resulting from financial contracts and commitments at december 31 2017  we have not included information on our normal recurring purchases of materials for use in our operations 

the amounts in the following table are generally consistent from year to year closely reflect our levels of production and are not longterm in nature 



  

 

unrecognized tax benefits of 260 million are not included in the table above because 80 million is offset by deferred tax assets and the remainder cannot be reasonably estimated to be settled in cash due to a lack of prior settlement history and offsetting credits 

at december 31 2017  we were not required and accordingly are not planning to make any cash contributions to the domestic qualified pension plan for 2018 our minimum funding requirements after 2018 as set forth by erisa are dependent on several factors as discussed under “accounting for pension plans” in the critical accounting policies section of this management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation estimates beyond 2018 have not been provided due to the significant uncertainty of these amounts which are subject to change until the company’s pension assumptions can be updated at the appropriate times in addition certain pension contributions are eligible for future recovery through the pricing of products and services to the us government under certain government contracts therefore the amounts noted are not necessarily indicative of the impact these contributions may have on our liquidity we also have payments due under our other postretirement benefit plans these plans are not required to be funded in advance but are pay as you go see further discussion in note 11 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements teledyne intends to continue to monitor and manage its defined benefit pension plans obligation and may take additional actions to manage risk in the future 

operating activities 

in 2017  net cash provided by operating activities was 3747 million  compared with 3170 million  in 2016  and 2102 million  in 2015  the higher cash provided by operating activities in 2017 compared with 2016 reflected cash flow from e2v and the impact of higher operating income partially offset by 121 million in higher income tax payments the higher cash provided by operating activities in 2016 compared with 2015 reflected 619 million in lower income tax payments lower annual bonus and regular payroll payments and higher customer advanced payments partially offset by higher payments for severance facility closure and relocation costs and lower operating income 

free cash flow cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures was 3162 million  in 2017  compared with 2294 million  in 2016  and 1632 million  in 2015  adjusted free cash flow reflects utilization of restricted cash from the sale of a former operating facility which funded in part the facility purchase pursuant to a 1031 likekind exchange and was 3162 million  in 2017 compared with 2489 million  in 2016  and 1632 million  in 2015

the higher capital spending amount in 2016 primarily reflected the purchase of an operating facility for 260 million during 2018 we plan to invest approximately 800 million  in capital expenditures principally to upgrade facilities and capital equipment reduce manufacturing costs and introduce new products 

acquisitions 

investing activities used cash for acquisitions and investments of 7741 million  934 million  and 667 million  in 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively see “recent acquisitions” teledyne funded the acquisitions primarily from borrowings under its credit facilities issuance of senior notes and term loans and cash on hand 

for all acquisitions the results of operations and cash flows are included in our consolidated financial statements from the date of each respective acquisition most of e2v’s operations are included in the digital imaging and aerospace and defense electronics segments the instrumentation segment includes a small portion of e2v’s operations the caris and icm acquisitions are part of the digital imaging segment all other acquisitions in 2017 2016 and 2015 are part of the instrumentation segment 

the following table shows the purchase price net of cash acquired goodwill acquired and intangible assets acquired for the acquisitions and other investments made in 2017  and 2016  in millions 



  

goodwill resulting from the acquisitions of ssi frontline quantum data in usa and caris will be deductible for tax purposes goodwill resulting from the acquisitions of e2v and hanson research will not be deductible for tax purposes

other matters 

pension plans 

teledyne has a domestic qualified defined benefit pension plan covering substantially all us employees hired before january 1 2004 or approximately 13  of teledyne’s active employees as of december 31 2017 as of january 1 2004 new us hires participate in a domestic defined contribution plan in 2017 2016 and 2015 teledyne’s domestic pension plan was over 100 funded thus no cash contributions were made for the company’s domestic pension plan the discount rate for 2018 will decrease to 402 from 454 in 2017 the company also has several smaller domestic and foreignbased defined benefit pension plans 

income taxes 

our income tax expense deferred tax assets and liabilities and reserves for unrecognized tax benefits reflect management’s best assessment of estimated current and future taxes to be paid we are subject to income taxes in both the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions significant judgments and estimates are required in determining the consolidated income tax expense 

on a provisional basis we intend to reinvest indefinitely the earnings of our material foreign subsidiaries in our operations outside of the united states the cash that the companys foreign subsidiaries hold for indefinite reinvestment is generally used to finance foreign operations and investments including acquisitions we estimate that future domestic cash generation will be sufficient to meet future domestic cash requirements due to the tax act us federal and applicable state income taxes have been accrued for the deemed repatriation at december 31 2017 the amount of undistributed foreign 

earnings was 3243 million for which we have not recorded a deferred tax liability of approximately 14 million for state corporate income taxes which would be due if reinvested foreign earnings were repatriated should we decide to repatriate the foreign earnings we would need to adjust our income tax provision in the period we determined that we would no longer indefinitely reinvest the earnings outside the united states 

deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amount in the financial statements which will result in taxable or deductible amounts in the future in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets within the jurisdiction from which they arise we consider all available positive and negative evidence including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities projected future taxable income taxplanning strategies and results of recent operations in projecting future taxable income we begin with historical results adjusted for the results of discontinued operations and incorporate assumptions about the amount of future state federal and foreign pretax operating income adjusted for items that do not have tax consequences the assumptions about future taxable income require significant judgment and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses in evaluating the objective evidence that historical results provide we consider three years of cumulative operating income based on the company’s history of operating earnings expectations of future operating earnings and potential tax planning strategies management believes that it is possible that some portion of deferred taxes will not be realized as a future tax benefit and therefore has recorded a valuation allowance 

we file income tax returns in the united states federal jurisdiction and in various states and foreign jurisdictions the company has substantially concluded on all us federal income tax matters for all years through 2013 united kingdom and france income tax matters for all years through 2014 and canadian income tax matters for all years through 2009 

costs and pricing 

inflationary trends in recent years have been moderate current inventory costs the increasing costs of equipment and other costs are considered in establishing sales pricing policies the company emphasizes cost containment in all aspects of its business 

hedging activities and market risk disclosures 

teledyne transacts business in various foreign currencies and has international sales and expenses denominated in foreign currencies subjecting the company to foreign currency risk the company ’ s primary objective is to protect the united states dollar value of future cash flows and minimize the volatility of reported earnings the company utilizes foreign currency forward contracts to reduce the volatility of cash flows primarily related to forecasted revenue and expenses denominated in canadian dollars for our canadian companies including dalsa and in british pounds for our uk companies including e2v these contracts are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges the company has converted a us dollar denominated variable rate debt obligation into a euro fixed rate obligation using a receivefloat pay fixed cross currency swap this cross currency swap is designated as a cash flow hedge 

  the effectiveness of the cash flow hedge forward contracts excluding time value is assessed prospectively and retrospectively on a monthly basis using regression analysis as well as using other timing and probability criteria to receive hedge accounting treatment all hedging relationships are formally documented at the inception of the hedges and must be highly effective in offsetting changes to future cash flows on hedged transactions the effective portion of the cash flow hedge contracts’ gains or losses resulting from changes in the fair value of these hedges is initially reported net of tax as a component of accumulated other comprehensive incomeloss  “ aoci ”  in stockholders’ equity until the underlying hedged item is reflected in our consolidated statements of income at which time the effective amount in aoci is reclassified to cost of sales in our consolidated statements of income net deferred gains recorded in aoci net of tax for forward contracts that will mature in the next 12 months total 32 million these gains are expected to be offset by anticipated losses in the value of the forecasted underlying hedged item amounts related to the cross currency swap expected to be reclassified from aoci into income in the coming 12 months total 22 million 

in the event that the gains or losses in aoci are deemed to be ineffective the ineffective portion of gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value if any is reclassified to other income and expense in the event that the underlying forecasted transactions do not occur or it becomes remote that they will occur within the defined hedge period the gains or losses on the related cash flow hedges will be reclassified from aoci to other income and expense during the current reporting period all forecasted transactions occurred and therefore there were no such gains or losses reclassified to other income and expense as of december 31 2017  teledyne had foreign currency forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges to buy canadian dollars and to sell us dollars totaling 806 million  these foreign currency forward contracts have maturities ranging from march 2018 to february 2019 e2v had foreign currency forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges to buy british pounds and to sell us dollars totaling 06 million  these foreign currency forward contracts have maturities ranging from march 2018 to april 2018 together these contracts had a fair value of 38 million the cross currency swap has notional amounts of 930 million euros equivalent to 1000 million and matures in october 2019 

in addition the company utilizes foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate foreign exchange rate risk associated with foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities including intercompany receivables and payables as of december 31 2017  teledyne had foreign currency contracts of this type in the following currency pairs in millions 



these contracts had a fair value of 38 million  at december 31 2017  the gains and losses on these derivatives which are not designated as hedging instruments are intended to at a minimum partially offset the transaction gains and losses recognized in earnings all derivatives are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value as discussed below the accounting for gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value depends on the use of the derivative and whether it is designated and qualifies for hedge accounting teledyne does not use foreign currency forward contracts for speculative or trading purposes 

notwithstanding our efforts to mitigate portions of our foreign currency exchange rate risks there can be no assurance that our hedging activities will adequately protect us against the risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations a hypothetical 10 percent price change of the us dollar from its value at december 31 2017  would result in a decrease or increase in the fair value of our foreign currency forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges to buy canadian dollars and to sell us dollars by approximately 81 million  a hypothetical 10 percent price change in the us dollar from its value at december 31 2017 would result in a decrease or increase in the fair value of our eurous dollar cross currency swap designated as a cash flow hedge by approximately 102 million  

borrowings under our credit facility are at fixed rates that vary with the term and timing of each loan under the facility loans under the facility typically have terms of one two three or six months and the interest rate for each such loan is subject to change if the loan is continued or converted following the applicable maturity date interest rates are also subject to change based on our debt to earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization ratio as of december 31 2017  we had1650 million outstanding under our 7500 million credit facility any borrowings under the company’s revolving credit line are based on a fluctuating market interest rate and consequently the fair value of any outstanding debt should not be affected materially by changes in market interest rates 

we believe that adequate controls are in place to monitor any hedging activities our primary exposure to market risk relates to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates we periodically evaluate these risks and have taken measures to mitigate these risks we own assets and operate facilities in countries that have been politically stable 

environmental 

we are subject to various federal state local and international environmental laws and regulations which require that we investigate and remediate the effects of the release or disposal of materials at sites associated with past and present operations these include sites at which teledyne has been identified as a potentially responsible party under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act commonly known as superfund and comparable state laws we are currently involved in the investigation and remediation of a number of sites reserves for environmental investigation and remediation totaled 51 million  at december 31 2017  and 70 million  at january 1 2017  as investigation and remediation of these sites proceed and new information is received the company will adjust accruals to reflect new information based on current information we do not believe that future environmental costs in excess of those already accrued will materially and adversely affect our financial condition or liquidity see also our environmental risk factor disclosure beginning on page 25 and notes 2 and 14 to our notes to consolidated financial statements 

government contracts 

we perform work on a number of contracts with the us department of defense and other agencies and departments of the us government including subcontracts with government prime contractors sales under these contracts with the us government which included contracts with the us department of defense were approximately 24  of total sales in 2017  27  of total sales in 2016  and 26  of total sales in 2015  for a summary of sales to the us government by segment see note 12 to our notes to consolidated financial statements sales to the us department of defense represented approximately 18  21  and 19  of total sales for 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively 

performance under government contracts has certain inherent risks that could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business results of operations and financial condition government contracts are conditioned upon the continuing availability of congressional appropriations which usually occurs on a fiscal year basis even though contract performance may take more than one year see also our government contracts risks factor disclosure beginning on page 18 

for information on accounts receivable from the us government see note 5 to our notes to consolidated financial statements 

estimates and reserves 

our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent liabilities on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including those related to product returns and replacements allowance for doubtful accounts inventories intangible assets income taxes warranty obligations pension and other postretirement benefits longterm contracts environmental workers’ compensation and general liability employee benefits and other contingencies and litigation we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances at the time the results of which form the basis for making our judgments actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions in some cases such differences may be material see also critical accounting policies 

the following table reflects significant reserves and valuation accounts which are estimates and based on judgments as described above at december 31 2017  and january 1 2017  



  

a this table should be read in conjunction with the notes to consolidated financial statements 

b includes both longterm and shortterm reserves 

some of the company’s products are subject to standard warranties and the company provides for the estimated cost of product warranties we regularly assess the adequacy of our preexisting warranty liabilities and adjust amounts as necessary based on a review of historic warranty experience with respect to the applicable business or products as well as the length and actual terms of the warranties which are typically one year the product warranty reserve is included in current accrued liabilities and other longterm liabilities on the balance sheet 



critical accounting policies 

the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with united states generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the notes to the financial statements some of those judgments can be subjective and complex and therefore actual results could differ materially from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions our critical accounting policies are those that are reflective of significant judgment complexity and uncertainty and may potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions we have identified the following as critical accounting policies revenue recognition accounting for pension plans accounting for business combinations goodwill and other longlived assets and accounting for income taxes for additional discussion of the application of these and other accounting policies see note 2 of our notes to consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition 

revenue is recognized when the earnings process is substantially complete and all of the following criteria are met 1 persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists 2 delivery has occurred or services have been rendered 3 our price to our customer is fixed or determinable and 4 collectability is reasonably assured 

we determine the appropriate method by which we recognize revenue by analyzing the terms and conditions of our contracts or arrangements entered into with our customers the majority of our revenue relates to product sales and is recognized upon shipment to the customer at fixed or determinable prices and with a reasonable assurance of collection passage of title to the customer and fulfillment of all significant obligations revenue is recognized net of estimated sales returns and other allowances the company does not offer substantial sales incentives and credits to customers the remaining revenue is generally associated with longterm contracts to design develop and manufacture highly engineered products used in commercial or defense applications such contracts are generally accounted for using contract accounting percentageofcompletion “poc” method 

the company’s standard terms of sale are fob shipping point for a small percentage of sales where title and risk of loss passes at destination point and assuming all other criteria for revenue recognition are met the company recognizes revenue upon delivery to the customer if any significant obligation to the customer with respect to a sales transaction remains following shipment revenue recognition is deferred until such obligations have been fulfilled in general our revenue arrangements do not involve acceptance provisions based on customer specified acceptance criteria in those circumstances when customer specified acceptance criteria exist and if we cannot demonstrate that the system meets those specifications prior to the shipment then revenue is deferred until customer acceptance is obtained 

we have a few contracts that require the company to warehouse certain goods for which revenue is recognized when all risks of loss is borne by the customer and all other criteria for revenue recognition are met 

we also have a small number of multiple elements arrangements ie free product training installation additional parts etc if contract accounting does not apply we allocate the contract price among the deliverables based on vendorspecific objective evidence of fair value to each element in the arrangement if objective and reliable evidence of fair value of any element is not available we use our best estimate of selling price for purposes of allocating the total arrangement consideration among the elements also extended or noncustomary warranties do not represent a significant portion of our revenue however when our revenue arrangements include an extended or noncustomary warranty provision the revenue is deferred and recognized ratably over the extended warranty period 

for contracts that require substantial performance over a long time period generally one or more years revenue is recorded under the poc method we record net revenue and an estimated profit as work on our contracts progresses the poc method for these contracts is dependent on the nature of the contract or products provided depending on the contract we may measure the extent of progress toward completion using the unitsofdelivery method costtocost method or upon attainment of scheduled performance contract milestones which could be time event or expense driven for example for costreimbursable contracts we use the costtocost method to measure progress toward completion under the costtocost method of accounting we recognize revenue and an estimated profit as allowable costs are incurred based on the proportion that the incurred costs bear to total estimated costs another example for contracts that require us to provide a substantial number of similar items we record revenue and an estimated profit on a poc basis using unitsofdelivery as the basis to measure progress toward completing the contract occasionally it is appropriate to combine individual customer orders and treat them as one arrangement when the underlying agreement was reached with the customer for a single large project 

accounting for contracts using the poc method requires management judgment relative to assessing risks estimating contract revenue and cost and making assumptions for schedule and technical issues contract revenue may include estimated amounts not contractually agreed to by the customer including price redetermination cost or performance incentives such as award and incentives fees unpriced change orders claims and requests for equitable adjustment the poc method requires management’s judgment to make reasonably dependable cost estimates generally over a long time period since certain contracts extend over a long period of time the impact of revisions in cost and revenue estimates during the progress of work 

may adjust the current period earnings on a cumulative catchup basis this method recognizes in the current period the cumulative effect of the changes on current and prior quarters additionally if the current contract estimate indicates a loss a provision is made for the total anticipated loss in the period that it becomes evident contract cost and revenue estimates for significant contracts are generally reviewed and reassessed at least quarterly the percentage of teledyne revenue recognized using any poc method was 286  in 2017 305 in 2016 and 312 in 2015 the net aggregate effects of changes in estimates on contracts accounted for under the poc accounting method for 2017 and 2016 were 75 million and 19 million of unfavorable operating income respectively and 31 million of favorable operating income for 2015 

 we do not believe that any discrete event or adjustment to an individual contract within the aggregate changes in contract estimates for 2017  2016  or 2015  was material to the consolidated statements of income for such annual periods 

in may 2014 the fasb issued asu no 201409 revenue from contracts with customers which provides a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and will supersede most current revenue recognition guidance we adopted the new guidance effective january 1 2018 for a discussion of this new accounting standard see note 2 of our notes to consolidated financial statements 

pension plans 

teledyne has a domestic qualified defined benefit pension plan covering substantially all us employees hired before january 1 2004 or approximately 13  of teledyne’s active employees as of january 1 2004 new us hires participate in a defined contribution plan only the company also has several smaller domestic and foreignbased defined benefit pension plans at december 31 2017 the benefit obligation for the domestic defined benefit pension plans totaled 8123 million and the fair value of the net qualified plan assets totaled 8960 million at december 31 2017 the benefit obligation for the foreignbased pension plans totaled 578 million and the fair value of the net plan assets totaled 467 million the company’s accounting for its defined benefit pension plans requires that amounts recognized in financial statements be determined on an actuarial basis rather than as contributions are made to the plan in consultation with our actuaries we determine the appropriate assumptions for use in determining the liability for future pension benefits net actuarial gains or losses are amortized to expense on a planbyplan basis when they exceed the accounting corridor the accounting corridor is a defined range within which amortization of net gains and losses is not required and is equal to 10 percent of the greater of the market related value of assets or benefit obligations gains or losses outside of the corridor are subject to amortization over our average employee future service period of approximately nine years significant assumptions used in determining the company’s pension income or expense is the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets participant mortality estimates expected rates of increase in future compensation levels employee turnover as well as the assumed discount rate on pension obligations the company has assumed based upon the types of securities the domestic qualified pension plan assets are invested in and the longterm historical returns of these investments that the longterm expected return on the domestic qualified pension plan assets will be 80  in 2018 and the assumed discount rate for determining benefit obligations will be 402  in 2018 the company’s longterm expected return on the domestic qualified pension assets used in 2017  was 80 and the assumed discount rate used in 2017  was 454  the actual rate of return on the domestic qualified pension plan assets was 157 in 2017  and 71 in 2016  for its domestic qualified pension plan if the actual rate of return on pension assets is below the expected rate of return the company may be required to make additional contributions to the pension trust at december 31 2017 the domestic qualified pension plan is overfunded and contributions are not required the company did not make any cash contributions to its domestic qualified pension plan since 2013 when it made a voluntary pretax cash contribution of 830 million  before recovery from the us government each year beginning with 2014 the society of actuaries has released revised mortality tables which updated life expectancy assumptions in consideration of these tables we updated the mortality assumptions used in determining our pension obligations our plan remains overfunded after the impact of the new mortality assumptions as well as from changes to other relevant assumptions at yearend 2017  the company has a 2295 million  noncash reduction to stockholders’ equity and a longterm additional liability of 3663 million  related to its pension plans at yearend 2016  the company had a 2496 million  noncash reduction to stockholders’ equity and a longterm additional liability of 3696 million  related to its pension plans 

differences in the discount rate and expected longterm rate of return on assets within the indicated range would have had the following impact on 2017  pension expense in millions 

see note 11 of our notes to consolidated financial statements for additional pension disclosures 

business combinations goodwill and acquired intangible assets 

the results for all acquisitions are included in the company’s consolidated financial statements from the date of each respective acquisition business acquisitions are accounted for under the acquisition method by assigning the purchase price to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at their fair values and the excess of the purchase price over the amounts assigned is recorded as goodwill we determine the fair value of such assets and liabilities generally in consultation with thirdparty valuation advisors acquired intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives adjustments to fair value assessments are recorded to goodwill over the purchase price allocation period 

goodwill and acquired intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized we review goodwill and acquired indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable the company also performs an annual impairment test in the fourth quarter of each year we test goodwill and acquired indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment between annual tests if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce our enterprise fair value below its book value these events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate including a significant sustained decline in an entity’s market value legal factors operating performance indicators competition sale or disposition of a significant portion of the business or other factors based on impairment tests completed in 2017  2016 and 2015 the company recorded 02 million 10 million and 05 million impairment to acquired intangible assets respectively no impairment of goodwill was indicated in 2017 2016 or 2015 based on the annual impairment test completed in the fourth quarter of each year 

for goodwill impairment testing the company estimates the fair value of the reporting units mainly through using a discounted cash flow model based on our best estimate of amounts and timing of future revenues and cash flows and our most recent business and strategic plans and compares the estimated fair value to the carrying value of the reporting unit including goodwill the discounted cash flow model requires judgmental assumptions about projected revenue growth future operating margins discount rates and terminal values over a multiyear period there are inherent uncertainties related to these assumptions and management’s judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill impairment while the company believes it has made reasonable estimates and assumptions to calculate the fair value of its reporting units it is possible a material change could occur if actual results are not consistent with management’s estimates and assumptions goodwill may be overstated and a charge would need to be taken against net earnings 

as of december 31 2017  the company had 12 reporting units for goodwill impairment testing the carrying value of goodwill included in the company’s individual reporting units ranges from 12 million to 6876 million the company’s analysis in 2017 indicated that in all instances the fair value of the company’s reporting units exceeded their carrying values and consequently did not result in an impairment charge the excess of the estimated fair value over the carrying value expressed as a percentage of carrying value of the respective reporting unit for each of the company’s reporting units as of the fourth quarter of 2017 the annual testing date ranged from approximately 29 to 2124 

changes in our projections used in the discounted cash flow model could affect the estimated fair value of certain of the company’s reporting units and could result in a goodwill impairment charge in a future period in order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations used in the goodwill impairment test the company applied a hypothetical 10 decrease to the fair values of each reporting unit and compared those values to the reporting unit carrying values based on this sensitivity analysis the company did not identify any goodwill impairment due to the many variables inherent in the estimation of a reporting unit’s fair value and the relative size of our recorded goodwill differences in assumptions may have a material effect on the results of our impairment analysis 

the impairment test for indefinitelived intangibles other than goodwill primarily trademarks and trade names consists of a comparison of the fair value of the indefinitelived intangible asset to the carrying value of the asset as of the impairment testing date the company estimates the fair value of its indefinitelived intangibles using a discounted cash flow model based on our best estimate of amounts and timing of future revenues from our most recent business and strategic plans and compares the estimated fair value to the carrying value of the asset 

income taxes 

income tax expense and deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect management’s assessment of actual future taxes to be paid on items reflected in the financial statements significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes uncertainty exists regarding tax positions taken in previously filed tax returns still under examination and positions expected to be taken in the current year and future returns deferred tax assets and liabilities arise due to differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and tax carryforwards although we believe our income tax expense and deferred tax assets and liabilities are reasonable no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome will not be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals to the extent that the final tax outcome is different than the amounts recorded such differences will impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made the provision for income taxes includes the impact of uncertain tax benefits that are considered appropriate as well as the related 

net interest 

significant judgment is required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets in assessing the need for a valuation allowance we consider all available evidence including past operating results estimates of future taxable income and the feasibility of tax planning strategies in the event that we change our determination as to the amount of deferred tax assets that can be realized we will adjust our valuation allowance with a corresponding impact to the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made 

we record uncertain tax benefits on the basis of a twostep process whereby 1 we determine whether it is more likely than not that the tax positions will be sustained on the basis of the technical merits of the positions and 2 for those tax positions that meet the “morelikelythannot” recognition threshold we recognize the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50 percent likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement with the related tax authority 

on december 22 2017 the tax cuts and jobs act was enacted the tax act significantly revised the us corporate income tax by among other things lowering corporate income tax rates implementing the territorial tax system and imposing a tax on deemed repatriation of nonus earnings as a result of the tax act teledyne incurred provisional charges of 47 million  in the fourth quarter of 2017 primarily due to the repatriation tax and the remeasurement of us deferred tax assets and liabilities in accordance with the tax act the company will elect to pay the repatriation tax liability over a period of eight years with the first installment of 31 million  due in 2018 the remainder of the tax liability is recorded in noncurrent income tax payable the repatriation tax resulted in a net tax expense of 262 million  and the remeasurement of us deferred tax assets and liabilities resulted in a net tax benefit of 215 million  the impacts of the tax act may differ from this estimate possibly materially and the amount of the provisional charge may accordingly be adjusted over the course of 2018 due to changes in interpretations and assumptions teledyne has made guidance that may be issued and actions teledyne may take as a result of the tax act these adjustments to the provisional charge related to the tax act will be recorded quarterly until the computations are complete which is expected no later than the fourth quarter of 2018 

an increase of 100 basis point increase in our nominal tax rate would have resulted in additional income tax provision for the fiscal year ended december 31 2017 of 29 million for a description of the company’s tax accounting policies refer to note 2 and note 10 of our notes to consolidated financial statements

safe harbor cautionary statement regarding forwardlooking information 

this management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation contains forwardlooking statements as defined in the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 directly and indirectly relating to earnings growth opportunities acquisitions and divestitures product sales capital expenditures pension matters stock option compensation expense the credit facility interest expense severance and relocation costs environmental remediation cost stock repurchases taxes exchange rate fluctuations and strategic plans all statements made in this management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation that are not historical in nature should be considered forwardlooking actual results could differ materially from these forwardlooking statements 

many factors could change the anticipated results including disruptions in the global economy changes in demand for products sold to the defense electronics instrumentation digital imaging energy exploration and production commercial aviation semiconductor and communications markets funding continuation and award of government programs changes in the estimated impact of the tax act and cuts to defense spending resulting from existing and future deficit reduction measures impacts from the united kingdom’s planned exit from the european union uncertainties related to the policies of the us presidential administration and threats to the security of our confidential and proprietary information including cyber security threats lower oil and natural gas prices as well as instability in the middle east or other oil producing regions and new regulations or restrictions relating to energy production including with respect to hydraulic fracturing could further   negatively affect our businesses that supply the oil and gas industry increasing fuel costs could negatively affect the markets of our commercial aviation businesses in addition financial market fluctuations affect the value of our pension assets 

information regarding the impact of the tax act consists of preliminary estimates which are forwardlooking statements and are subject to change possibly materially as the company completes its financial statements information regarding the impact of the tax act is based on our current calculations as well as our current interpretations assumptions and expectations relating to the tax act which are subject to change 

changes in the policies of us and foreign governments could result over time in reductions or realignment in defense or other government spending and further changes in programs in which the company participates 

while teledyne’s growth strategy includes possible acquisitions we cannot provide any assurance as to when if or on what terms any acquisitions will be made acquisitions involve various inherent risks such as among others our ability to integrate acquired businesses retain customers and achieve identified financial and operating synergies there are additional risks associated with acquiring owning and operating businesses outside of the united states including those arising from us and foreign government policy changes or actions and exchange rate fluctuations 

we continue to take action to assure compliance with the internal controls disclosure controls and other requirements of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 while we believe our control systems are effective there are inherent limitations in all control systems and misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and may not be detected 

additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in the forwardlooking statements is contained beginning on page 13 of this form 10k under the caption “risk factors cautionary statement as to forwardlooking statements” forwardlooking statements are generally accompanied by words such as “estimate” “project” “predict” “believes” or “expect” that convey the uncertainty of future events or outcomes we assume no obligation to publicly update or revise any forwardlooking statements whether as a result of new information or otherwise

seasonality 

no material portion of our business is considered to be seasonal 

raw materials and suppliers 

generally our businesses have experienced minimal fluctuations in the supply of raw materials but not without some price volatility while some of our businesses provide services for those businesses that sell hardware and product a portion of the value that we provide is labororiented such as design engineering assembly and test activities in manufacturing our products we use our own production capabilities and also third party suppliers and subcontractors including international sources some of the items we use for the manufacture of our products including certain gyro components for some marine navigation applications certain magnets and helix wire for our traveling wave tubes certain infrared detectors substrates and certain ceramics and molding compounds used in our sonar systems as well as certain scintillator materials used in the production of our xray detectors are purchased from limited or single sources including international sources due to technical capability price and other factors while over the years we have not experienced much difficulty in procuring raw materials components subassemblies and other supplies required in our manufacturing processes disruption in the global economy and financial markets could trigger increased pricing or otherwise affect our suppliers and negatively impact our ability to procure such supplies 

sales and marketing 

our sales and marketing approach varies by segment and by products within our segments a shared fundamental tenet is the commitment to work closely with our customers to understand their needs with an aim to secure preferred supplier and longerterm relationships 

our segments use a combination of internal sales forces thirdparty distributors and commissioned sales representatives to market and sell our products and services our teledyne instruments companies and other businesses have been working over the years to consolidate or share internal sales and servicing efforts several teledyne businesses have been marketing and selling products collaboratively to similar customers to promote “onestop” shopping under singular “brand” names including teledyne marine teledyne oil  gas teledyne water quality and teledyne microwave solutions

the following text highlights various risks and uncertainties associated with teledyne these factors could materially affect “forwardlooking statements” within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 that we may make from time to time including forwardlooking statements contained in “item 1 business” and “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” of this form 10k and in teledyne’s 2016  annual report to stockholders it is not possible for management to predict all such factors and new factors may emerge additionally management cannot assess the impact of each such factor on teledyne or the extent to which any factor or combination of factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forwardlooking statements 

  

a new global recession continued economic uncertainty in europe or an economic downturn in china may adversely affect us 

if another global recession emerges if economic uncertainty in europe continues or worsens or if economic growth in china substantially slows we may experience declines in revenues profitability and cash flows from reduced orders payment delays collection difficulties increased price pressures for our products increased risk of excess and obsolete inventories or other factors caused by the economic problems of customers if negative conditions in the global credit markets prevent our customers’ access to credit or render them insolvent orders for our products may decrease which would result in lower revenue likewise if our suppliers face challenges in obtaining credit in selling their products or otherwise in operating their businesses or remaining solvent they may become unable to offer the materials we use to manufacture our products these events could adversely impact our ability to manufacture affected products and could also result in reductions in our revenue increased price competition and increased operating costs which could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we develop and manufacture products for customers in the energy exploration and production markets domestic and international commercial aerospace markets the semiconductor industry the consumer electronics telecommunications and automotive industries each of which has been cyclical exhibited rapid changes and suffered from fluctuating market demands a cyclical downturn in these markets may materially affect future operating results in 2015 and 2016 for example our revenue and income were negatively impacted by the downturn in energy markets 

in addition we sell products and services to customers in industries that are sensitive to the level of general economic activity and consumer spending habits and in more mature industries that are sensitive to capacity adverse economic conditions affecting these industries may reduce demand for our products and services which may reduce our revenues profits or production levels for example in 2014 several of our major customers reduced their marine seismic operations in connection with a general slowdown in the marine seismic exploration industry some of our businesses serve industries such as power generation and petrochemical refining which may be negatively impacted by reductions in global capital expenditures and manufacturing capacity 

a material amount of our total revenues is derived from companies in the oil and gas industry especially the offshore oil and gas industry a historically cyclical industry with levels of activity that are significantly affected by the levels and volatility of oil and gas prices 

a material amount of our total revenues is derived from customers in or connected to the oil and gas exploration development and production especially the offshore oil and gas industry one of our largest commercial customers is in the offshore oil and gas industry and accounted for 23  and 28  of total sales in 2015  and 2014  respectively in 2016 no commercial customer in the offshore oil and gas industry accounted for more than 1 of total sales the oil and gas industry is a historically cyclical industry characterized by significant changes in the levels of exploration and development activities in 2014 and again in 2015 and 2016 the price of brent crude oil experienced dramatic declines from a high of 116 in june 2014 to a low of 27 in january 2016 oil and gas prices and market expectations of potential changes in those prices significantly affect the levels of those activities worldwide political economic and military events have contributed to oil and gas price volatility and are likely to continue to do so in the future any prolonged reduction in the overall level of offshore oil and gas exploration and development activities whether resulting from changes in oil and gas prices or otherwise could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations of our businesses within our instrumentation segment some factors that have affected and are likely to continue affecting oil and gas prices and the level of demand for our services and products include the following 



 

teledyne manufactures seismic sources interconnects and data acquisition products used in offshore energy exploration when crude oil and natural gas prices are low the level of marine seismic exploration activity typically decreases potentially resulting in reduced demand for our products used in offshore energy exploration in addition a decline in the level of capital spending by oil and natural gas companies may result in a reduced pace of development of new energy reserves which could adversely affect demand for our products related to energy production and in certain instances result in the cancellation modification or rescheduling of existing orders 

risks related to the proposed acquisition of e2v 

with the pending acquisition of e2v the risk profile of teledyne may differ materially from prior years which could materially change our results of operations 

on december 12 2016 teledyne and e2v reached agreement on the terms of a recommended cash acquisition to be made by teledyne for the ordinary share capital of e2v by means of a scheme of arrangement at announcement the aggregate enterprise value for the transaction is expected to be approximately £6271 million or approximately 7889 million taking into account e2v stock options and net debt it is expected that subject to the satisfaction or waiver of all relevant conditions the acquisition will be completed in the first half of calendar 2017 e2v is a leading designer developer and manufacturer of radio frequency “rf” power systems imaging solutions and semiconductors to the aerospace security and defense space medical scientific and industrial markets e2v is headquartered in the united kingdom with key operations in the united kingdom france the united states and spain 

as discussed below while there are risks associated with acquisitions generally including closing and integration risks there are additional risks associated with owning and operating businesses internationally including those arising from us and foreign policy changes political instability and exchange rate fluctuations with this acquisition a greater percentage of teledyne’s revenues and expenses will arise from international sources the acquisition will also significantly expand teledyne’s international employee base and manufacturing footprint as a result of the acquisition of e2v the financial results of the combined company will be more exposed to currency exchange rate fluctuations and an increased proportion of assets liabilities and earnings will be denominated in nonus dollar currencies the combined company will present its financial statements in us dollars and will have a significant proportion of net assets expenses and income in nonus dollar currencies primarily the british pound the canadian dollar and the euro the combined company’s financial results and capital ratios will therefore be sensitive to movements in foreign exchange rates a depreciation of nonus dollar currencies relative to the us dollar could have an adverse impact on the combined company’s financial results 

while most of the products made and markets served by e2v are complementary to teledyne the acquisition of e2v will expand the size of teledyne’s digital imaging segment relative to its other segments continued innovation and research and development efforts will be required to maintain e2v’s leadership position in imaging products and semiconductor production e2v’s business also may be more capital intensive than many of teledyne’s other businesses increasing teledyne’s capital requirements approximately one quarter of e2v’s revenue relates to longterm contracts many of which involve advancements in technology and are fixed price as discussed below an inherent risk in fixed price contracts is that actual performance costs may exceed the projected costs on which the contracts are agreed the failure to anticipate technical problems estimate costs accurately or control costs during the performance of a fixed price contract can reduce its profitability or result in a loss 

we may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of the proposed acquisition of e2v or those benefits may take longer to realize than expected we may also encounter significant unexpected difficulties in integrating the two businesses 

our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the pending acquisition of e2v will depend to a large extent on our ability to integrate our business with e2v’s business combining two independent businesses is a complex costly and timeconsuming process as a result we will be required to devote significant management attention and resources to integrating the business practices and operations of the company and e2v the integration process may disrupt the combined business and if implemented ineffectively could preclude the realization of the full benefits of the acquisition that are currently expected our failure to meet the challenges involved in integrating the two businesses and to realize the anticipated benefits of the proposed acquisition could cause an interruption of or a loss of momentum in the activities of e2v and teledyne and could adversely affect our results of operations in addition the overall integration of the businesses may result in material unanticipated problems expenses liabilities competitive responses loss of customer relationships and diversion of management’s attention 

in addition even if the operations of the businesses of the teledyne and e2v are integrated successfully we may not realize the full benefits of the proposed acquisition including the synergies cost savings or sales or growth opportunities that we expect or the full benefits may not be achieved within the anticipated time frame or at all additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the integration of the two businesses all of these factors could adversely affect our earnings decrease or delay the expected accretive effect of the proposed acquisition or negatively impact the price of our common stock as a result we cannot assure that the combination of teledyne’s and e2v’s businesses will result in the realization of the full benefits anticipated from the proposed acquisition 

  

in order to close the proposed acquisition of e2v we will need to incur a significant level of debt that could have significant consequences for our business and any investment in our securities 

  

the proposed acquisition of e2v will be teledyne’s largest acquisition to date in connection with the announcement of the proposed acquisition in december 2016 we entered into a £6250 million bridge credit facility to fund the acquisition and related transaction costs in order to meet the requirement under the uk city code on takeovers and mergers that we have sufficient and certain resources available to fund the consideration for the acquisition in january 2017 we amended our revolving credit agreement to allow us to use that facility to fund part of the consideration in lieu of the bridge credit facility we intend to use the proceeds of the term loans and the senior notes to fund the consideration and transaction costs for the proposed acquisition the indebtedness we have incurred and expect to incur to fund the proposed acquisition could have significant consequences for our business and any investment in our common stock including 

  

 the pending acquisition of e2v is subject to various closing conditions as well as other uncertainties and there can be no assurances as to whether and when it may be completed failure to consummate the proposed acquisition could negatively impact our stock price and our future business and financial results 

the consummation of the proposed acquisition of e2v is subject to certain customary conditions a number of the remaining conditions are not within our or e2v’s control and it is possible that such conditions may prevent delay or otherwise materially adversely affect the completion of the acquisition at meetings held in january 2017 e2v shareholders voted in favor of the resolution to approve the scheme of arrangement and voted to pass a special resolution to approve the implementation of the scheme the waiting periods required under both the us hartscottrodino antitrust improvements act of 1976 as amended and in respect of the e2v’s us state department’s itar registration have expired clearance or expiration of the waiting period under german merger control laws remains outstanding after discussions with the german authorities e2v and teledyne submitted a revised application for clearance on february 24 2017 in respect of the acquisition the german authorities have one month to review such revised submission clearance from the french ministry of economy and finance and the french ministry of defense in respect of the acquisition also remains outstanding 

under the uk city code on takeovers and mergers we may in certain cases invoke a condition to the acquisition to cause the acquisition not to proceed only if the uk panel on takeovers and mergers is satisfied that the circumstances giving rise to that condition not being satisfied are of material significance to the company in the context of the acquisition because of this consent requirement the conditions may provide us less protection than the customary conditions in an offer for a us domestic company we therefore may be required to proceed with the acquisition in the event of a material adverse change at e2v 

we cannot predict with certainty whether and when any of the remaining required conditions will be satisfied or if another uncertainty may arise if the proposed acquisition does not receive or timely receive the required regulatory approvals and clearances or if another event occurs that delays or prevents the acquisition such delay or failure to complete the acquisition and the acquisition process may cause uncertainty or other negative consequences that may materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations and to the extent that the current price of our common stock reflects an assumption that the acquisition will be completed the price per share for our common stock could be negatively impacted 

we are subject to the risks associated with international sales and international operations which could harm our business or results of operations 

during 2016  sales to international customers accounted for approximately 43  of our total revenues compared with 44  in 2015  and 45  in 2014  in 2016  we sold products to customers in over 100 countries in 2016  the top five countries for international sales were china  the united kingdom  germany  south korea  and japan  constituting approximately 20  of our total sales our acquisitions including caris in 2016 bowtech products limited “bowtech” and icm in 2015 bolt in 2014 reson in 2013 lecroy in 2012 and dalsa in 2011 contributed to greater international sales as noted above our pending acquisition of e2v will add to our international presence we anticipate that future sales to international customers will continue to account for a significant and increasing percentage of our revenues particularly since business and growth plans for many teledyne businesses focus on sales outside of the united states including to emerging markets such as china brazil and west africa 

risks associated with international sales include but are not limited to 

 any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition exchange rate fluctuations may negatively affect the cost of our products to international customers and therefore reduce our competitive position given our several canadabased businesses volatility in the value of the canadian dollar relative to the us dollar or other foreign currencies could adversely affect the business operations and the financial condition of our digital imaging segment 

in june 2016 the united kingdom “uk” held a referendum in which voters approved an exit from the european union “eu” commonly referred to as “brexit” the announcement of brexit caused significant volatility in global stock markets and currency exchange rate fluctuations that resulted in the strengthening of the us dollar against foreign currencies in which we conduct business the announcement of brexit and the potential withdrawal of the uk from the eu may also create further global economic uncertainty which may adversely impact the economies of the uk the eu countries and other nations may cause our current and future customers to reduce their spending on our products and services and may cause certain eubased customers to source products from businesses based outside of the uk for example brexitrelated uncertainty could lead to a reconsideration by airbus as to future investment and spending in the uk which could reduce sales for our ukbased businesses that supply airbus given our several ukbased businesses including our pending acquisition of e2v volatility in the value of the british pound relative to the us dollar or other foreign currencies could increase the cost of raw materials and components for our ukbased businesses and could otherwise adversely affect the business operations and the financial condition of our ukbased businesses 

sales of our products and services internationally are subject to us and local government regulations and procurement policies and practices including regulations relating to importexport control violations of export control rules could result in the impositions of fines and penalties or the suspension of our ability to export items from one or more businesses or the entire corporation depending on the scope of the suspension this could have a material effect on our ability to perform certain international contracts attempts by the new presidential administration to withdraw from or materially modify international trade agreements which were raised as a possibility in the 2016 presidential campaign could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

among other things we are subject to the us foreign corrupt practices act or fcpa which generally prohibits us companies and their intermediaries from bribing foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or keeping business or otherwise obtaining favorable treatment further in 2011 the united kingdom also implemented the uk bribery act which increased the level of antibribery law enforcement and compliance relative to the fcpa any determination that we had violated the fcpa the uk bribery act or equivalent antibribery and corruption laws in countries in which we do business could result in sanctions that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations while we have procedures and compliance programs in place and conduct fcpa and other trainings we cannot provide assurance that our internal controls will always protect us from misconduct by our employees agents or business partners 

our international operations are subject to risks customarily encountered in foreign operations including interruption to transportation flows for delivery of parts to us and finished goods to our customers changes in a specific country’s or region’s political or economic conditions trade protection measures import or export licensing requirements consequences from changes in tax laws and regulatory requirements difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations differing labor regulations differing protection of intellectual property and geopolitical turmoil including terrorism and war we are also exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk inherent in our sales commitments anticipated sales and expenses and assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the local functional currency and may also become subject to interest rate risk inherent in any debt we incur or financial investments we hold 

acquisitions involve inherent risks that may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

our growth strategy includes acquisitions acquisitions involve various inherent risks such as 

 while we conduct financial and other due diligence in connection with our acquisitions and generally seek some form of protection including indemnification from a seller and sometimes an escrow of a portion of the purchase price to cover potential issues such acquired companies may have weaknesses or liabilities that are not accurately assessed or brought to our attention at the time of the acquisition further indemnities or escrows may not fully cover such matters particularly matters identified after a closing 

as they have over the last few years acquisitions may also change the nature and level of various risks faced by teledyne for example our acquisition of bolt in 2014 increased our exposure to the offshore energy exploration market the bolt acquisition the dalsa acquisition in 2011 and the lecroy acquisition in 2012 increased the percentage of sales attributable to commercial customers as opposed to the us government as noted above our pending acquisition of e2v increases our international presence and the percentage of sales related to the digital imaging segment these acquisitions coupled with our other recently acquired companies located outside of the united states also increased the percentage of revenues and expenses that arise from international sources and consequently our exposure to us and foreign policy changes and exchange rate fluctuations additionally the businesses of e2v dalsa and lecroy are more capital intensive than other teledyne businesses which could result in increasing teledyne’s capital requirements 

under sec rules teledyne must issue a report on management’s assessment of the effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting the sec permits a limited timebased exclusion for acquisitions to give a company an opportunity to evaluate more fully the internal controls of acquired companies and correct deficiencies and institute new or additional internal controls our 2016 management’s report specifically excludes from its scope and coverage our 2016 acquisitions of caris quantum data frontline in usa and hanson allowing us additional time to evaluate existing internal controls and implement additional controls as appropriate with regard to future acquisitions we can provide no assurance that we will be able to provide a report that contains no significant deficiencies or material weaknesses with respect to these acquired companies or other acquisitions 

in connection with our acquisitions including ones which we do not complete we may incur significant transaction costs we are required to expense as incurred such transaction costs which may have a material adverse impact on our quarterly financial results further the acquisitions of us public companies such as bolt and lecroy now routinely trigger purported class action lawsuits filed by shareholders of the target companies the defense of which has increased transaction costs among other things 

changes in future business conditions could cause business investments goodwill and other longlived assets to become impaired resulting in significant losses and writedowns that would reduce our operating income 

on january 1 2017  teledyne’s goodwill was 11935 million  and net acquired intangible assets were 2346 million  under current accounting guidance we are required to test annually both acquired goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment based upon a fair value approach rather than amortizing them over time we have chosen to perform our annual impairment reviews of goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year we also are required to test goodwill for impairment between annual tests if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce our enterprise fair value below its book value these events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate including a significant sustained decline in an entity’s market value legal factors operating performance indicators competition sale or disposition of a significant portion of the business or other factors if the fair market value is less than the carrying value including goodwill we could be required to record an impairment charge the valuation of reporting units requires judgment in estimating future cash flows discount rates and estimated product life cycles in making these judgments we evaluate the financial health of the business including such factors as industry performance changes in technology and operating cash flows as we have grown through acquisitions the amount of goodwill and net acquired intangible assets is a significant portion of our total assets as a result the amount of any annual or interim impairment could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our reported financial results for the period in which the charge is taken we also may be required to record an earnings charge or incur unanticipated expenses if as a result of a change in strategy or other reason we were to determine the value of other assets had been impaired 

united states and global responses to terrorism continuing turmoil in middle eastern countries concerns regarding nuclear proliferation and the safety of nuclear energy potential epidemics financial issues facing airlines and volatile energy prices increase uncertainties with respect to many of our businesses and may adversely affect our business and results of operations 

united states’ and global responses to terrorism continuing turmoil in middle eastern countries and nuclear proliferation concerns increase uncertainties with respect to us and other business and financial markets and could adversely affect our business and operations 

air travel declines have occurred after terrorist attacks and heightened security alerts as well as after the highprofile outbreaks of disease while travel by our sales and service personnel to various regions has been affected by such factors additional declines in air travel resulting from such factors and other factors could adversely affect the financial condition of many of our commercial airline and aircraft manufacturer customers and in turn could adversely affect our aerospace and defense electronics segment the 2015 paris terrorist attacks or the syrian refugee crisis could result in governments in europe imposing greater restrictions on the movement of personnel or goods which could adversely impact our businesses located within the european union or our ability to sell products in that region in addition a prolonged virus epidemic or pandemic or the threat thereof could result in worker absences lower productivity voluntary closure of our offices and manufacturing 

facilities disruptions in our supply chain travel restrictions on our employees and other disruptions to our businesses moreover health epidemics may force local health and government authorities to mandate the temporary closure of our offices and manufacturing facilities 

deterioration of financial performance of airlines could result in a reduction of discretionary spending for upgrades of avionics and inflight communications equipment which would adversely affect our aerospace and defense electronics segment 

higher oil prices could adversely affect commercial airlinerelated customers of our aerospace and defense electronics segment conversely lower oil prices have decreased oil exploration and petrochemical refining activities and have hindered our marine and other instrumentation businesses in addition instability in the middle east or other oilproducing regions could adversely affect expansion plans of the oil and gas industry customers of our instrumentation and cable solutions businesses 

our revenue from government contracts subjects us to many risks 

our revenue from us government contracts depends on the continued availability of funding from the us government and accordingly we have the risk that funding for our existing contracts may be canceled or diverted to other uses or delayed 

we perform work on a number of contracts with the us department of defense and other agencies and departments of the us government including subcontracts with government prime contractors sales under contracts with the us government as a whole including sales under contracts with the us department of defense as prime contractor or subcontractor represented approximately 27  of our total revenue in 2016  compared with 26  in 2015  and 25  in 2014  performance under government contracts has inherent risks that could have a material effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

government contracts are conditioned upon the continuing availability of congressional appropriations and the failure of congress to appropriate funds for programs in which we participate could negatively affect our results of operations the us government shutdown during 2013 negatively affected many of our businesses and the failure by congress to approve future budgets on a timely basis could delay procurement of our products and services and cause us to lose future revenues additionally defense spending is expected to continue to decline in some areas over the next few years a continued emphasis on federal deficit and debt reduction could lead to a further decrease in overall defense spending the continued war on terrorism also could result in a diversion of funds from programs in which teledyne participates budgetary concerns could result in future contracts being awarded more on price than on other competitive factors and smaller defense budgets could result in government insourcing of programs and more intense competition on programs that are not insourced which could result in lower revenues and profits 

the sequestration provision of the budget control act of 2011 originally imposed 5000 billion of defense cuts over nine years starting in fiscal year 2013 which represented approximately 9 of planned defense funding over the period on november 2 2015 the bipartisan budget act of 2015 the budget act was signed into law the budget act raises the statutory limit on the amount of permissible federal debt the debt ceiling until march 2017 and raises the sequester caps imposed by the budget control act of 2011 by 800 billion split equally between defense and domestic spending 500 billion in government fiscal year 2016 and 300 billion in government fiscal year 2017 on december 18 2015 congress passed and the president signed the consolidated appropriations act of 2016 which provides funding for the us government for the government’s 2016 fiscal year providing 11 trillion in discretionary funding for federal agencies through september 2016 the president signed a continuing resolution in september 2016 which was extended in december 2016 and provides funding for the us government at fiscal 2016 levels through april 28 2017 congress has yet to pass a budget although both chambers are moving forward with appropriations bills the total statutory spending cap remains at 11 trillion as set by the relief authorized in 2016 and 2017 by the bipartisan budget act of 2015 to the original sequestration specified by the budget act of 2011 which set discretionary caps through 2021 

continued defense spending does not necessarily correlate to continued business for us because not all of the programs in which we participate or have current capabilities may be provided with continued funding changes in policy and budget priorities by the president his administration and the us congress for various defense and nasa programs could continue to impact our engineered systems aerospace and defense electronics and digital imaging segments for example changes in national space policy that affect nasa’s budget have occurred there have also been significant reductions in missile defense budgets our engineered systems segment may be further impacted by delays in production runs under the jassm and harpoon missile programs as well as us department of defense directives to introduce competitive bidding for programs on which we have previously served as sole source the president has expressed concern over the cost of the f35 joint strike fighter program our aerospace and defense electronics segment may be impacted by volume andor price reductions in connection with this program to the extent they are imposed the timing of program cycles can affect our results of operations for a particular quarter or year and cancellations of significant programs such as the objective simulation framework “osf” or the shallow water combat submersible “swcs” would affect our results it is also not uncommon for the us 

department of defense to delay the timing of awards for major programs for six to twelve months reductions and delays in research and development funding by the us government may continue to impact our revenues as darpa reviews its programs aimed to technologically enhance us military capabilities and national security changes to the darpa research and technology development programs in which we participate could occur uncertainty over budgets or priorities with the new presidential administration could result in delays in funding changes in funded programs and the timing of awards that could have a material impact on our revenues in 2017 finally various us department of defense initiatives such as the emphasis on insourcing positions to the government and anticipated reductions or cancellations of existing programs could negatively impact our engineered systems segment 

our participation in government programs may decrease or be subject to renegotiation as those programs evolve over time 

the us government has been placing emphasis on small business quotas and increasing small business contract set asides and minimum work percentages in some cases prime contractors are required to reduce participation by large subcontractors like teledyne in order to fill small business quotas and be responsive to proposals and bids as a result our engineered systems segment could be significantly impacted 

over time and for a variety of reasons programs can evolve and affect the extent of our participation we have been a significant participant in nasa programs primarily through our engineered systems segment and through teledyne scientific company the prior administration introduced significant changes to the national space policy including the cancellation of the nasa’s constellation program which includes ares launch vehicles teledyne brown engineering has developed the muses an earth imaging platform as part of our commercial spacebased digital imaging business the muses platform depends on continued operation of the iss and we may not be successful in developing the technology or commercial relationships necessary to make this investment profitable the launch of muses has been delayed due to several launch failures by space x and is now scheduled for the summer of 2017 continued delays in launching muses could have adverse impact on the success of this platform while most recently in early 2014 we were awarded a fiveyear 600 million contract by nasa’s marshall space flight center to develop and manufacture the launch vehicle stage adapter for the space launch system failure to further transition our business successfully could result in reduced sales in addition delayed funding and changes in support for nasa’s current space policy could negatively impact our business the new presidential administration could also lead to changes to the nation’s space policy some or all of which could materially impact our results 

our contracts with the us government are subject to termination rights that could adversely affect us 

most of our us government contracts are subject to termination by the us government either at its convenience or upon the default of the contractor termination for convenience provisions provide only for the recovery of costs incurred or committed settlement expenses and profit on work completed prior to termination termination for default clauses impose liability on the contractor for excess costs incurred by the us government in reprocuring undelivered items from another source we had one  us government contract terminated for convenience in 2016  compared with eight  in 2015  and three  in 2014  no contracts were terminated for default during such threeyear period 

we may lose money or generate less than expected profits on our fixedprice and other government contracts and we may lose money if we fail to meet certain prespecified targets in government contracts 

there is no guarantee that us government contracts will be profitable a number of our us government prime contracts and subcontracts are fixedprice type contracts  54  of our total us government contracts were fixedprice in 2016  54  in 2015  and 58  in 2014  under these types of contracts we bear the inherent risk that actual performance cost may exceed the fixed contract price under such contracts we must absorb cost overruns notwithstanding the difficulty of estimating all of the costs we will incur in performing these contracts we cannot assure that our contract loss provisions in our financial statements will be adequate to cover all actual future losses we may lose money or generate lower profits on some contracts if we fail to meet these estimates we may also lose money on nonfixed price costreimbursement contracts that contain disincentives or penalties related to cost schedule or performance 

our business is subject to government contracting regulations including increasingly complex regulations on cybersecurity and our failure to comply with such laws and regulations could harm our operating results and prospects 

we like other government contractors are subject to various audits reviews and investigations including private party “whistleblower” lawsuits relating to our compliance with federal and state laws more routinely the us government may audit the costs we incur on our us government contracts including allocated indirect costs such audits could result in adjustments to our contract costs any costs found to be improperly allocated to a specific contract will not be reimbursed and such costs already reimbursed would need to be refunded we have recorded contract revenues based upon costs we expect to realize on final audit in a worst case scenario should a business or division involved be charged with wrongdoing or should the us government determine that the business or division is not a “presently responsible contractor” that business or division and conceivably our company as a whole could be temporarily suspended or in the event of a conviction could be debarred for up to three years from receiving new government contracts or governmentapproved subcontracts in addition we could expend substantial amounts defending against such charges and in damages fines and penalties if such charges were proven or were to result in negotiated settlements the department of defense as well as other us government contracting agencies have adopted new rules and regulations requiring contractors to implement a set of cyber security measures to attain the safeguarding of contractor systems that process store or transmit certain information implementation and compliance with these new cyber security requirements is complex and costly and could result in unforeseen expenses lower profitability and in the case of noncompliance penalties and damages all of which could have an adverse effect on our business 

our indebtedness and any failure to comply with our covenants that apply to our indebtedness could materially and adversely affect our business 

as of january 1 2017  we had 6117 million  in total outstanding indebtedness this indebtedness included 4250 million  in senior unsecured notes 1825 million  in term loans and no amounts outstanding under our 7500 million  2015amended credit facility as a result of our pending acquisition of e2v we expect that our total indebtedness will initially increase by approximately 7000 million our indebtedness could harm our business by among other things reducing the funds available to make new strategic acquisitions or reducing our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and market conditions our indebtedness exposes us to interest rate risk since a portion of our debt obligations are at variable rates our indebtedness could also have a material adverse effect on our business by increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions or a downturn in our business general adverse economic and industry conditions or a downturn in our business could result in our inability to repay this indebtedness in a timely manner 

our pension expense and the value of our pension assets are affected by factors outside of our control including the performance of plan assets the stock market interest rates and actuarial experience 

we have a domestic qualified defined benefit pension plan covering most of our us employees hired prior to 2004 or approximately 16  of our active employees we also have several smaller domestic and foreignbased pension plans as of january 1 2017 the value of the combined pension assets is greater than our combined pension benefit obligations the accounting rules applicable to our pension plans require that amounts recognized in the financial statements be determined on an actuarial basis rather than as contributions are made to the plan two significant elements in determining our pension income or pension expense are the expected return on plan assets and the discount rate used in projecting pension benefit obligations declines in the stock market and lower rates of return could increase required contributions to our qualified pension plan andor result in a change to shareholders’ equity our investment strategy may not produce the expected returns if the credit financial or stock markets deteriorate any decreases or increases in market interest rates will affect the discount rate assumption used in projecting pension benefit obligations in addition changes in other actuarial assumptions such as mortality assumptions or change due to legislative or regulatory actions could impact our pension income or expense as well as funding obligations each year beginning with 2014 the society of actuaries released revised mortality tables which updated life expectancy assumptions in consideration of these tables we updated the mortality assumptions used in determining our pension and postretirement obligations in consideration of these tables we modified the mortality assumptions used in determining our pension and postretirement benefit obligations the impact of these mortality assumptions increased our pension obligation and increased future pension expense in 2013 we made a voluntary pretax cash contribution of 830 million  to the domestic pension plan no contributions were made to the domestic pension plan since the 2013 contribution if and to the extent decreases in our pension assets are not offset by voluntary contributions recovered through future asset returns mitigated by an increase in the rate at which the benefit obligation is discounted or other actions our required cash contributions and pension expense could increase under the plans for additional discussion of pension matters see the discussion under “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition” and notes 2 and 11 to our notes to consolidated financial statements 

our business and operations could suffer in the event of cyber security breaches 

attempts by others to gain unauthorized access to our information technology systems have become more sophisticated and are sometimes successful these attempts which might be related to industrial or foreign government espionage activism or other motivations include covertly introducing malware to our computers and networks performing reconnaissance impersonating authorized users stealing corrupting or restricting our access to data among other activities we continue to update our infrastructure security tools and processes to protect against security incidents including both external and internal threats and to prevent their recurrence company personnel and third parties have been tasked to detect and investigate such incidents but it is possible that we might not prevent or be aware of an incident or its magnitude and effects the theft corruption unauthorized use or publication of our intellectual property andor confidential business information could harm our competitive position reduce the value of our investment in research and development and other strategic initiatives or otherwise adversely affect our business we are subject to us department of defense regulations applicable to certain types of data residing on or transiting through certain information systems and we expect these regulations will be incorporated into certain contracts we hold to the extent that any security breach results in inappropriate disclosure of confidential or controlled information of employees third parties or the us government we may incur liability or the loss of contracts or security clearances as a result in addition we expect to continue devoting additional resources to the security of our information technology systems more resources may be required in the defense arena to the extent the us government increases its cyber security mandates 

we may not have sufficient resources to fund all future research and development and capital expenditures or possible acquisitions 

in order to remain competitive we must make substantial investments in research and development of new or enhanced products and continuously upgrade our process technology and manufacturing capabilities our teledyne scientific company subsidiary which serves as our primary research center has been actively promoting and funding joint research and development projects with other teledyne businesses including our teledyne oil  gas businesses teledyne reynolds inc teledyne brown engineering inc dalsa and lecroy the business of e2v for which the design and development of specialized technology for high performance systems and equipment is integral will once acquired also require substantial investments in research and development additionally some of our businesses are actively pursuing governmental support and funding for some of their research and development initiatives including dalsa with respect to its cmos and uncooled infrared image sensor development efforts nonetheless we may be unable to fund all of our research and development and capital investment needs or possible acquisitions our ability to raise additional capital will depend on a variety of factors some of which will not be within our control including the existence of bank and capital markets investor perceptions of us our businesses and the industries in which we operate and general economic conditions failure to successfully raise needed capital or generate cash flow on a timely or costeffective basis could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition in addition if we fail to accurately predict future customer needs and preferences or fail to produce viable technologies we may invest heavily in research and development of products that do not lead to significant revenue which would adversely affect our profitability 

limitations in customer funding for applied research and development and technology insertion projects and government support for research and development expenditures may reduce our ability to apply our ongoing investments in some market areas 

we may be unable to successfully introduce new and enhanced products in a timely and costeffective manner or increase our participation in new markets which could harm our profitability and prospects 

our operating results depend in part on our ability to introduce new and enhanced products on a timely basis in order to improve our product development capabilities we purchased the research center that is now teledyne scientific company in 2006 and in 2011 we purchased dalsa which has access to a wellequipped mems research and development center in 2013 we opened a 52000squarefoot technology development center in daytona beach florida primarily to serve the offshore oil and gas production and exploration industries successful product development and introduction depend on numerous factors including our ability to anticipate customer and market requirements changes in technology and industry standards our ability to differentiate our offerings from offerings of our competitors and market acceptance we may not be able to develop and introduce new or enhanced products in a timely and costeffective manner or to develop and introduce products that satisfy customer requirements 

our new products also may not achieve market acceptance or correctly address new industry standards and technological changes we may also lose any technological advantage to competitors if we fail to develop new products in a timely manner 

additionally new products may trigger increased warranty costs as information on such products is augmented by actual usage accelerated entry of new products to meet heightened market demand and competitive pressures may cause additional warranty costs as development and testing time periods might be accelerated or condensed 

we intend to both adapt our existing technologies and develop new products to expand into new market segments we may be unsuccessful in accessing these and other new markets if our products do not meet our customers’ requirements as a result of changes in either technology and industry standards or because of actions taken by our competitors 

technological change and evolving industry and regulatory standards could cause some of our products or services to become obsolete or noncompetitive 

the markets for some of our products and services are characterized by rapid technological development evolving industry standards changes in customer requirements and new product introductions and enhancements a faster than anticipated change in one or more of the technologies related to our products or services or in market demand for products or services based on a particular technology could result in faster than anticipated obsolescence of certain of our products or services and could lead to reduced sales of those products which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition currently accepted industry and regulatory standards are also subject to change which may contribute to the obsolescence of our products or services the political agenda of the new presidential administration may affect the level of environmental regulations and enforcement and government spending on scientific research which could adversely impact the sales of our products and services including sales of pollution monitoring instruments and instruments used to measure the earth’s climate and climate change such as undersea gliders and spacebased imaging sensors 

we may not be able to reduce the costs of our products to satisfy customers’ cost reduction mandates which could harm our sales or margins 

more and more customers continue to seek price reductions of our products while we continually work to reduce our manufacturing and other costs of our products without affecting product quality and reliability there is no assurance that we will be able to do so and do so in a timely manner to satisfy the pricing pressures of our customers cost reductions of raw materials and other components used in our products may be beyond our control depending on market conditions customers may seek lower cost products from china and other developing countries where manufacturing costs are lower 

the airline industry is heavily regulated and if we fail to comply with applicable requirements our results of operations could suffer 

governmental agencies throughout the world including the us federal aviation administration or the faa prescribe standards and qualification requirements for aircraft components including virtually all commercial airline and general aviation products specific regulations vary from country to country although compliance with faa requirements generally satisfies regulatory requirements in other countries if any material authorization or approval qualifying us to supply our products is revoked or suspended then the sale of the product would be prohibited by law which would have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

from time to time the faa or equivalent regulatory agencies in other countries propose new regulations or changes to existing regulations which are usually more stringent than existing regulations if these proposed regulations are adopted and enacted we may incur significant additional costs to achieve compliance which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations recent trends by china’s aviation authority to relax restrictions on airspace may be reversed and anticipated new regulations loosening airspace restrictions may not materialize which could impact the future prospects of our commercial aerospace businesses china’s aviation authorities recently adopted new safety regulations for airlines that resulted in increased sales of our avionics products in china in 2016 if these regulations are reversed the growth prospects of our commercial aerospace business in china may be limited 

  increasing competition could reduce the demand for our products and services 

each of our markets is highly competitive many of our competitors have and potential competitors could have greater name recognition a larger installed base of products more extensive engineering manufacturing marketing and distribution capabilities and greater financial technological and personnel resources than we do new or existing competitors may also develop new technologies that could adversely affect the demand for our products and services industry acquisition and consolidation trends particularly among aerospace and defense contractors have adversely impacted demand for our aerospace and defense related engineering services as large prime contractors insource increased amounts of major acquisition programs and also require significant expansion in small business participation to meet government contracting goals lowcost competition from china and other developing countries could also result in decreased demand for our products increasing competition could reduce the volume of our sales or the prices we may charge which would negatively impact our revenues smaller defense budgets both in the united states and europe could result in additional competition for new and existing defense programs 

product liability claims product recalls and field service actions could have a material adverse effect on our reputation business results of operations and financial condition and we may have difficulty obtaining product liability and other insurance coverage 

as a manufacturer and distributor of a wide variety of products including monitoring instruments products used in offshore oil and gas production products used in commercial aviation and products used in medical devices most recently including xray detectors and generators our results of operations are susceptible to adverse publicity regarding the quality or safety of our products in part product liability claims challenging the safety of our products may result in a decline in sales for a particular product which could adversely affect our results of operations this could be the case even if the claims themselves are proven untrue or settled for immaterial amounts 

while we have general liability and other insurance policies concerning product liabilities we have selfinsured retentions or deductibles under such policies with respect to a portion of these liabilities awarded damages could be more than our accruals we could incur losses above the aggregate annual policy limit as well we cannot assure that for 2017 and in future years insurance carriers will be willing to renew coverage or provide new coverage for product liability 

product recalls can be expensive and tarnish our reputation and have a material adverse effect on the sales of our products we cannot assure that we will not have additional product liability claims or that we will not recall any products 

we have been joined among a number of defendants often over 100 in lawsuits alleging injury or death as a result of exposure to asbestos in addition because of the prominent “teledyne” name we may continue to be mistakenly joined in lawsuits involving a company or business that was not assumed by us as part of our 1999 spinoff to date we have not incurred material liabilities in connection with these lawsuits however our historic insurance coverage including that of its predecessors may not fully cover such claims and the defense of such matters coverage typically depends on the year of purported exposure and other factors nonetheless we intend to vigorously defend our position against these claims 

certain gas generators historically manufactured by teledyne energy systems inc contained a sealed wetted asbestos component while the company has transitioned to a replacement material had placed warning labels on its products and took care in the handling of this discontinued material by employees there is no assurance that the company will not face product liability or workers ’  compensation claims involving this component 

our teledyne brown engineering inc’s laboratory in knoxville tennessee performs radiological analyses our teledyne dalsa professional imaging unit develops image sensors used in medical and dental xray applications along with portable xray generators used in nondestructive testing and security applications in addition our teledyne dalsa digital imaging unit develops equipment and sensors used in eye examination and general surgical vision applications errors and omissions in analyses may occur or erroneous images could be captured our insurance coverage or indemnities may not be adequate to cover potential problems associated with faulty radiological analyses 

teledyne brown engineering inc and other teledyne companies manufacture components for customers in the nuclear power market including utilities and certain governmental entities certain liabilities associated with such products are covered by the priceanderson nuclear industries indemnity act and other statutory and common law defenses and we have received indemnities from some of our customers however there is no assurance we will not face product liability claims related to such products or that our exposure will not exceed the amounts for which we have liability coverage or protection 

our business and financial results could be adversely affected by conditions and other factors associated with our suppliers 

some items we purchase for the manufacture of our products are purchased from limited or single sources of supply due to technical capability price and other factors for example dalsa has a single source of supply for ccd semiconductor wafers used to assemble image sensors and an external single source of supply for cmos semiconductor wafers used to assemble xray panel products lecroy continues to outsource a portion of its research and development activities to a third party engineering firm in malaysia where it may be more difficult for us to enforce our intellectual property rights we have also outsourced from time to time the manufacturing of certain parts components subsystems and even finished products to single or limited sources including international sources disruption of these sources could cause delays or reductions in shipments of our products or increases in our costs which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or operations international sources possess additional risks some of which are similar to those described above in regard to international sales with any continuing disruption in the global economy and financial markets some of our suppliers may also continue to face issues gaining access to sufficient credit and materials to maintain their businesses which could reduce the availability of some components and to the extent such suppliers are single source suppliers could adversely affect our ability to continue to manufacture and sell our products continuing economic pressure on suppliers may also trigger increased pricing or workforce reductions or reduced workweeks and a shrinking supply base possibly creating longer lead times to obtain needed components for our products delays in material acceptance and a greater risk of receiving counterfeit parts 

some of our commercial product lines may have one or a limited number of customers the loss of which could adversely affect our business or financial results 

while no commercial customer accounted for more than 10 of our total sales during 2016  2015  and 2014  and we have hundreds of customers in the various industries that we serve some of our product lines may have one or a few key customers the loss of which could adversely affect our business or financial results in 2016  no commercial customer accounted for more than 20  of total sales teledyne’s largest commercial customer in 2015 and 2014 a customer of our instrumentation segment accounted for 23  and 28  of total sales in 2015  and 2014  respectively 

newer products such as our xray generators and xray panel products may initially be more heavily dependent on a singular or limited number of customers until market acceptance is obtained or due to contractual terms similarly some older product lines may be more heavily dependent on a singular or limited number of customers in either such case program delays of such customer or customers as well as the loss of such customer or customers could adversely affect our business or financial results 

we face risks related to sales through distributors and other third parties that we do not control which could harm our business 

we sell a portion of our products through third parties such as distributors valueadded resellers and oems collectively “distributors” using third parties for distribution exposes teledyne to many risks including concentration credit risk and compliance risks we may rely on one or more key distributors for a product and the loss of these distributors could reduce our revenue distributors may face financial difficulties including bankruptcy which could harm our collection of accounts receivables and financial results violations of the fcpa or similar antibribery laws by distributors or other third party intermediaries could have a material impact on our business failing to manage risks related to our use of distributors may reduce sales increase expenses and weaken our competitive position and could result in sanctions against us 

compliance with increasing environmental and climate change regulations as well as the effects of potential environmental liabilities could have a material adverse financial effect on us 

we like other industry participants are subject to various federal state local and international environmental laws and regulations we may be subject to increasingly stringent environmental standards in the future particularly as greenhouse gas emissions and climate change regulations and initiatives increase future developments administrative actions or liabilities relating to environmental and climate change matters could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition environmental regulations on hydraulic fracturing and the use of seismic energy sources for offshore energy exploration could adversely affect some product lines of our instrumentation segment 

our manufacturing operations including former operations could expose us to material environmental liabilities additionally companies we acquire may have environmental liabilities that are not accurately assessed or brought to our attention at the time of the acquisition 

the us environmental protection agency “epa” has focused on greenhouse gases “ghgs” maintaining ghgs threaten the public health and welfare of the american people the epa also maintains that ghg emissions from onroad vehicles contribute to that threat the epa’s endangerment finding covers emissions of six greenhouse gases the epa’s continuing efforts to limit ghg emissions could adversely affect our us manufacturing operations increase prices for energy fuel and transportation require us to accommodate changes in parameters such as the way parts are manufactured and may in some cases require us to redesign certain of our products this could lead to increased costs which we may not be able to recover from customers delays in product shipments and loss of market share to competitors 

for additional discussion of environmental matters see the discussion under the caption “other matters  environmental” of “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of results of operation and financial condition” and note 14 to our notes to consolidated financial statements 

our inability to attract and retain key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our future success 

our future success depends to a significant extent upon the continued service of our executive officers and other key management and technical personnel and on our ability to continue to attract retain and motivate qualified personnel we also have a maturing workforce while we have engaged in succession planning the loss of the services of one or more of our key employees or our failure to attract retain and motivate qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we may not be able to sell exit or reconfigure businesses facilities or product lines that we determine no longer meet with our growth strategy or that should be consolidated 

consistent with our strategy to emphasize growth in our core markets we continually evaluate our businesses to ensure that they are aligned with our strategy this review led to the decision to sell the net assets of the printed circuit technology “pct” business in 2016 and the general aviation piston engine businesses in 2011 as a result of our review and declines in our electronic manufacturing services businesses in 2013 we closed our teledyne microelectronics technologies’ facility in marina del rey california and relocated several of its product lines to other teledyne locations in further response to downturns in our defense businesses in 2013 we also began consolidating some of our microelectronic component operations into our mountain view california facility and also our shipley england facility and relatedly sold a former manufacturing site in sunnyvale california additionally we closed teledyne cml group limited’s precision machining and fabrications business in birkenhead england to focus more on its advanced composites manufacturing business 

in 2015 we began to consolidate some of the businesses units and facilities in our instrumentation segment and it continued into 2016 we may not be able to realize efficiencies and cost savings from these consolidation activities there is no assurance that our efforts will be successful if we do not successfully manage our current consolidation activities or any other similar activities that we may undertake in the future expected efficiencies and benefits might be delayed or not realized and our operations and business could be disrupted our ability to dispose of exit or reconfigure businesses that may no longer be aligned with our growth strategy will depend on many factors including the terms and conditions of any asset purchase and sale agreement as well as industry business and economic conditions we cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to sell nonstrategic businesses on terms that are acceptable to us or at all in addition if the sale of any nonstrategic business cannot be consummated or is not practical alternative courses of action including relocation of product lines or closure may not be available to us or may be more costly than anticipated 

natural and manmade disasters could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

several of our facilities as a result of their locations could be subject to a catastrophic loss caused by earthquakes hurricanes tornados floods ice storms or other natural disasters many of our production facilities and our headquarters are located in california and thus are in areas with above average seismic activity and may also be at risk of damage in wildfires teledyne dalsa’s semiconductor facilities in quebec canada have been impacted by severe ice storms including a storm in 2013 in addition we have manufacturing facilities in the southeastern united states and texas that have been threatened and struck by major hurricanes in october 2012 lecroy and other teledyne facilities incurred business interruptions and were without power for several days as a result of hurricane sandy our facilities in alabama florida nebraska tennessee and virginia have also been threatened by tornados in june 2012 a tornado caused substantial damage to and interrupted business at our teledyne hastings instruments facility in hampton virginia in april 2011 tornados caused substantial damage in huntsville alabama while teledyne brown engineering’s main facility in huntsville alabama incurred minimal building damage and business interruption the facility was without power for several days if any of our california facilities including our california headquarters were to experience a catastrophic earthquake or wildfire loss or if any of our alabama florida louisiana nebraska tennessee or texas facilities were to experience a catastrophic hurricane storm tornado or other natural disaster or if dalsa’s facilities in quebec experience longterm loss of electrical power such event could disrupt our operations delay production shipments and revenue and result in large expenses to repair or replace the facility or facilities while teledyne has property insurance to partially reimburse it for losses caused by windstorm and earth movement such insurance would not cover all possible losses in addition our existing disaster recovery and business continuity plans including those relating to our information technology systems may not be fully responsive to or minimize losses associated with catastrophic events 

the environmental disaster triggered by the deepwater horizon rig explosion and oil spill in 2010 resulted in a moratorium on offshore oil and gas production in the gulf of mexico that adversely affected the results of operations of some of our teledyne oil and gas businesses although such adverse impact was offset in part by the products we manufacture that supported wellcapping and environmental cleanup efforts environmental regulations enacted in the wake of this oil spill have resulted in increased compliance costs to some of our teledyne oil and gas businesses similar future manmade disasters that limit or cease offshore oil and gas production or further exploration in the regions in which we sell our products could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

disasters that do not directly impact us can have an indirect adverse impact on our business for example in 2011 the earthquake in northern japan and the related tsunami and severe flooding in thailand resulted in certain of our customers delaying orders for our products because they were unable to obtain critical supplies from vendors in the impacted areas 

teledyne brown engineering inc is building an imaging platform to be affixed to the iss for the program to be financially successful the 18 yearold iss must continue to fly in a safe and human tended condition while certain spaceflight risks such as a highvelocity debris impact to the station causing significant structural damage or necessitating the evacuation of the iss have been regarded as small if such event were to occur the iss program continuation could be threatened jeopardizing our investment and potential revenue generation from issbased earth imaging 

we may not be able to enforce or protect our intellectual property rights or third parties may claim infringement of their intellectual rights each which may harm our ability to compete and thus harm our business 

our ability to enforce and protect our patents copyrights software licenses trade secrets knowhow and other intellectual property rights is subject to general litigation risks as well as uncertainty as to the enforceability of our intellectual property rights in various countries when we seek to enforce our rights we have found that various claims may be asserted against us including claims that our intellectual property right is invalid is otherwise not enforceable or is licensed to the party against whom we are asserting a claim in addition we may be the target of aggressive and opportunistic enforcement of patents by third parties if we are not ultimately successful in defending ourselves against these claims in litigation we may not be able to sell a particular product or family of products due to an injunction or we may have to pay damages that could in turn harm our results of operations our inability to enforce our intellectual property rights under these circumstances may harm our competitive position and our business 

higher tax rates may harm our results of operations and cash flow 

our effective tax rate for 2016  was 209 compared with 243  for 2015  and 236  for 2014  while the new presidential administration has commented about lowering the corporate tax rate in the united states to improve global competitiveness a number of factors may impact our effective tax rates which could reduce our net income and increase our tax payments including 

 our inability to efficiently implement changes to our enterprise resource planning software could result in higher than expected costs or otherwise adversely impact our internal controls environment operations and profitability 

we are implementing enterprise resource planning software systems which are intended to improve our business processes in certain business units the costs associated with such systems can be significant and we could incur costs in excess of budgeted costs any technical or other difficulties in developing or implementing this initiative may increase the costs of the project and have an adverse effect on our operations and reporting processes including our internal controls over financial reporting as we make adjustments to operations as a result of this project we may incur incremental expenses prior to realizing the benefits of a more efficient workforce and operating structure although implementation has occurred in only selected business units to date and efforts have been made to minimize adverse impacts on our controls we cannot assure that all such impacts have been mitigated further we may not realize anticipated cost improvements and greater efficiencies from the project 

our financial statements are based on estimates required by generally accepted accounting principles in the united states “gaap” and actual results may differ materially from those estimated under different assumptions or conditions 

our financial statements are prepared in conformity with gaap these principles require our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period for example estimates are used when accounting for items such as asset valuations allowances for doubtful accounts allowance for excess and obsolete inventory depreciation and amortization impairment assessments employee benefits taxes recall and warranty costs product and general liability and contingencies while we base our estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances at the time made actual results may differ materially from those estimated our most critical accounting estimates are described in the management discussion in this form 10k under “critical accounting estimates” 

while we believe our internal control systems are effective there are inherent limitations in all control systems and misstatements resulting from error or fraud may occur and may not be detected 

we continue to take action to assure compliance with the internal controls disclosure controls and other requirements of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer cannot guarantee that our internal controls and disclosure controls will prevent all possible errors or all fraud a control system no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met in addition the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefit of controls must be relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no system of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within the company have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake further controls can be circumvented by individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more persons or by management override of the controls the design of any system of controls is also based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions over time a control may be inadequate because of changes in conditions or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate because of inherent limitations in a costeffective control system misstatements resulting from error or fraud may occur and may not be detected 

provisions of our governing documents applicable law and our change in control severance agreements could make an acquisition of teledyne more difficult 

our restated certificate of incorporation our amended and restated bylaws and the general corporation law of the state of delaware contain several provisions that could make the acquisition of control of teledyne in a transaction not approved by our board of directors more difficult we have also entered into change in control severance agreements with thirteen members of our current management which could have an antitakeover effect these provisions may prevent or discourage attempts to acquire our company 

the market price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly since we became a public company and could continue to do so 

since we became an independent public company on november 29 1999 the market price of our common stock has fluctuated substantially and fluctuations in our stock price could continue in fiscal 2015 our stock price declined 15 and in fiscal 2016 our stock increased 386 among the factors that could affect our stock price are 

 the stock markets in general and the markets for hightechnology companies in particular have experienced a high degree of volatility that is not necessarily related to the operating performance of these companies we cannot provide assurances as to our stock price we have in the past repurchased shares of our stock pursuant to boardapproved stock repurchase programs we cannot provide assurances that we will continue to repurchase shares under those programs or that our board will authorize new repurchase programs

teledyne technologies incorporated provides enabling technologies for industrial growth markets we have evolved from a company that was primarily focused on aerospace and defense to one that serves multiple markets that require advanced technology and high reliability these markets include deepwater oil and gas exploration and production oceanographic research air and water quality environmental monitoring factory automation and medical imaging our products include monitoring instrumentation for marine and environmental applications harsh environment interconnects electronic test and measurement equipment digital imaging sensors and cameras aircraft information management systems and defense electronics and satellite communication subsystems we also supply engineered systems for defense space environmental and energy applications we differentiate ourselves from many of our direct competitors by having a customer and company sponsored applied research center that augments our product development expertise 

strategyoverview 

our strategy continues to emphasize growth in our core markets of instrumentation digital imaging aerospace and defense electronics and engineered systems our core markets are characterized by high barriers to entry and include specialized products and services not likely to be commoditized we intend to strengthen and expand our core businesses with targeted acquisitions and through product development we continue to focus on balanced and disciplined capital deployment among capital expenditures acquisitions and share repurchases we aggressively pursue operational excellence to continually improve our margins and earnings at teledyne operational excellence includes the rapid integration of the businesses we acquire using complementary technology across our businesses and internal research and development we seek to create new products to grow our company and expand our addressable markets we continue to evaluate our businesses to ensure that they are aligned with our strategy

engineered systems 



our engineered systems segment provides innovative systems engineering and integration advanced technology development and manufacturing solutions for defense space environmental and energy applications this segment also designs and manufactures electrochemical energy systems and small turbine engines 

2016  compared with 2015   

our engineered systems segment sales were 2586 million  in 2016  compared with sales of 2746 million  in 2015  a decrease of 58  operating income was 321 million  in 2016  compared with 261 million  in 2015  an increase of 230  

the 2016  sales decrease of 160 million  reflected lower sales of engineered products and services of 127 million and lower energy system products of 48 million partially offset by higher sales of turbine engine sales of 15 million the lower sales of engineered products and services primarily resulted from decreased sales of space and missile defense programs the lower energy systems sales reflected lower sales of commercial hydrogen generators as well as government energy systems operating income in 2016  reflected improved margins for engineered products and services and higher pension income of 25 million partially offset by the impact of lower sales 

cost of sales for 2016  decreased by 197 million  compared with 2015  and reflected the impact of lower sales and higher pension income cost of sales as a percentage of sales for 2016  decreased to 799  compared with 824  in 2015  reflected the lower margin space and marine manufacturing programs ending in 2015 and also reflected the impact of higher pension income selling general and administrative expenses including research and development and bid and proposal expense decreased to 200 million  in 2016 compared with 223 million  in 2015 and reflected the impact of lower sales the selling general and administrative expense percentage decreased to 77  for 2016 compared with 81  in 2015 

2015  compared with 2014   

our engineered systems segment sales were 2746 million in 2015 compared with sales of 2719 million in 2014 an increase of 10 operating income was 261 million in 2015 compared with 314 million in 2014 a decrease of 169 

the 2015 sales increase of 27 million reflected higher sales of energy systems products of 65 million and engineered products and services of 40 million the higher energy systems sales primarily reflected increased sales for government energy systems turbine engine sales were lower by 78 million and reflected decreased sales for the joint airtosurface standoff missile program operating income in 2015 reflected the impact of higher sales more than offset by the impact of lower sales of higher margin turbine engines and higher pension expense of 20 million 

cost of sales for 2015 increased by 77 million compared with 2014 and reflected the higher sales and higher pension expense cost of sales as a percentage of sales for 2015 increased to 824 compared with 804 in 2014 and reflected the impact of higher pension expense and lower sales of higher margin turbine engines selling general and administrative expenses including research and development and bid and proposal expense increased to 223 million in 2015 compared with 220 million in 2014 and reflected the impact of higher sales the selling general and administrative expense percentage remained at 81 for 2015 compared with 2014 

  

financial condition liquidity and capital resources 

principal capital requirements 

our principal cash and capital requirements are to fund working capital needs capital expenditures income tax payments pension contributions and debt service requirements as well as acquisitions and the pending e2v acquisition we may also deploy cash for the stock repurchase program it is anticipated that operating cash flow together with available borrowings under the credit facility described below will be sufficient to meet these requirements and could be used to fund acquisitions in 2017 to support acquisitions we may need to raise additional capital our liquidity is not dependent upon the use of offbalance sheet financial arrangements we have no offbalance sheet financing arrangements that incorporate the use of special purpose or unconsolidated entities 

credit facility senior notes and term loans 

in december 2016 the company entered into an amendment relating to unsecured term loans of 1825 million in aggregate principal amount the “term loans” to extend the maturity date of the term loans from march 1 2019 to january 31 2022 and extending the date on which amortization of principal begins and generally lowering the applicable rate for base rate and eurocurrency loans the other material terms of the term loans including covenants remain unchanged in november 2015 the company issued 1250 million  in aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes “senior unsecured notes” the notes consisted of 250 million of 281 senior unsecured notes due in november 2020 and 1000 million of 328 senior unsecured notes due in november 2022 also in december 2015 the company amended the 7500 million unsecured credit facility “credit facility” to extend the maturity from march 2018 to december 2020 excluding interest and fees no payments are due under the credit facility until it matures borrowings under our credit facility and term loans are at variable rates which are at our option tied to a eurocurrency rate equal to libor london interbank offered rate plus an applicable rate or a base rate as defined in our credit agreements eurocurrency rate loans may be denominated in us dollars or an alternative currency as defined in the agreement eurocurrency or libor based loans under the facility typically have terms of one two three or six months and the interest rate for each such loan is subject to change if the loan is continued or converted following the applicable maturity date the company has not drawn any loans with a term longer than three months under the credit facility base rate loans have interest rates that primarily fluctuate with changes in the prime rate interest rates are also subject to change based on our consolidated leverage ratio as defined in the credit agreement the credit facility also provides for facility fees that vary between 012 and 025 of the credit line depending on our consolidated leverage ratio as calculated from time to time 

in connection with the agreement to acquire e2v teledyne together with certain of its subsidiaries as guarantors has entered into a credit agreement the “bridge facility” dated december 11 2016 the lenders under the bridge facility are committed to lend up to £3450 million to fund the acquisition and teledyne has committed to have remain available for borrowing up to 4100 million under its 7500 million credit facility to fund the acquisition no amounts have been drawn against the bridge facility to date 



at january 1 2017  we had 74 million  in capital leases of which 13 million  is current and had 155 million  in outstanding letters of credit 

our credit facility senior notes and term loans agreements require the company to comply with various financial and operating covenants including maintaining certain consolidated leverage and interest coverage ratios as well as minimum net worth levels and limits on acquired debt at january 1 2017  the company was in compliance with these covenants and we had a significant amount of margin between required financial covenant ratios and our actual ratios currently we do not believe our ability to undertake additional debt financing if needed is reasonably likely to be materially impacted by debt restrictions under our credit agreements subject to our complying with required financial covenants listed in the table below 

financial covenant ratios and the actual ratios at january 1 2017    



 in the event of an acquisition our debt instruments permit us at our option to exceed the consolidated leverage ratio of 325 to 1 for up to four quarters following the fiscal quarter in which the acquisition event occurs provided that the consolidated leverage ratio does not exceed 35 to 1 if the pending acquisition of e2v closes we expect to remain in compliance with this financial ratio as a result 

available borrowing capacity under the 7500 million credit facility which is reduced by borrowings and outstanding letters of credit was 7355 million  at january 1 2017  noting however that teledyne has committed to have remain available for borrowing up to 4100 million under this facility to fund the pending e2v acquisition 

teledyne also has a 50 million uncommitted credit line which permits credit extensions up to 50 million plus an incremental 20 million solely for standby letters of credit this credit line is utilized as needed for periodic cash needs at january 1 2017  35 million was outstanding under the uncommitted credit line no amounts were outstanding under this credit line at january 3 2016 

permanently reinvested earnings 

we intend to indefinitely reinvest the earnings of our material foreign subsidiaries in our operations outside of the united states the cash that the company’s foreign subsidiaries hold for indefinite reinvestment is generally used to finance foreign operations and investments including acquisitions we expect to fund a portion of the cost of the e2v acquisition with cash held by our foreign subsidiaries we estimate that future domestic cash generation will be sufficient to meet future domestic cash requirements at january 1 2017  the amount of undistributed foreign earnings was 2266 million of which we have not recorded a deferred tax liability of approximately 590 million should we decide to repatriate the foreign earnings we would need to adjust our income tax provision in the period we determined that the earnings will no longer be indefinitely invested outside the united states 

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our expected cash outflows resulting from financial contracts and commitments at january 1 2017  we have not included information on our normal recurring purchases of materials for use in our operations we have also not included any amounts that may be required related to our pending acquisition of e2v 

the amounts in the following table are generally consistent from year to year closely reflect our levels of production and are not longterm in nature 



  

 

unrecognized tax benefits of 245 million are not included in the table above because 71 million is offset by deferred tax assets and the remainder cannot be reasonably estimated to be settled in cash due to a lack of prior settlement history 

at january 1 2017  we were not required and accordingly are not planning to make any cash contributions to the domestic qualified pension plan for 2017 our minimum funding requirements after 2017 as set forth by erisa are dependent on several factors as discussed under “accounting for pension plans” in the critical accounting policies section of this management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation estimates beyond 2017 have not been provided due to the significant uncertainty of these amounts which are subject to change until the company’s pension assumptions can be updated at the appropriate times in addition certain pension contributions are eligible for future recovery through the pricing of products and services to the us government under certain government contracts therefore the amounts noted are not necessarily indicative of the impact these contributions may have on our liquidity we also have payments due under our other postretirement benefit plans these plans are not required to be funded in advance but are pay as you go see further discussion in note 11 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements teledyne intends to continue to monitor and manage its defined benefit pension plans obligation and may take additional actions to manage risk in the future 

operating activities 

in 2016  net cash provided by operating activities was 3170 million  compared with 2102 million  in 2015  and 2879 million  in 2014  the higher cash provided by operating activities in 2016 compared with 2015 reflected 619 million in lower income tax payments lower annual bonus and regular payroll payments and higher customer advanced payments partially offset by higher payments for severance facility closure and relocation costs and lower operating income the 2015 amounts reflected the receipt of 30 million related to a legal settlement while the 2014 amount reflected the receipt of 100 million related to a legal settlement the lower cash provided by operating activities in 2015 compared with 2014 reflected lower net income lower customer deposits and advanced payments and higher income tax payments 

free cash flow cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures was 2294 million  in 2016  compared with 1632 million  in 2015  and 2444 million  in 2014  adjusted free cash flow reflects utilization of restricted cash from the sale of a former operating facility which funded in part the facility purchase pursuant to a 1031 likekind exchange and was 2489 million  in 2016 compared with 1632 million  in 2015  and 2444 million  in 2014  



  

 



the increase in the current portion of longterm debt primarily reflects the expected repayment in 2017 of 1000 million in term loans the increase in accumulated other comprehensive loss reflects the impact of foreign currency adjustments and the noncash reduction to stockholders’ equity for the pension and postretirement plans 

investing activities 

net cash used in investing activities was 1510 million  1099 million  and 2387 million  for 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively cash flows relating to investing activities consists primarily of cash used for acquisitions and capital expenditures except 2016 also includes 93 million of cash received from the sale of a business and cash received of 195 million from the sale of a former operating facility 



the increase in capital spending in 2016 compared with 2015 primarily reflected the purchase of an operating facility during 2017 we plan to invest approximately 600 million  in capital expenditures principally to upgrade capital equipment reduce manufacturing costs and introduce new products commitments at january 1 2017  for capital expenditures were approximately 95 million  

acquisitions 

investing activities used cash for acquisitions and investments of 934 million  667 million  and 1958 million  in 2016  2015  and 2014  respectively see “recent acquisitions” 

teledyne funded the acquisitions primarily from borrowings under its credit facility and cash on hand 

for all acquisitions the results of operations and cash flows are included in our consolidated financial statements from the date of each respective acquisition the caris icm and axiom acquisitions are part of the digital imaging segment all other acquisitions in 2016 2015 and 2014 are part of the instrumentation segment 

the following table shows the purchase price net of cash acquired goodwill acquired and intangible assets acquired for the acquisitions and other investments made in 2016  and 2015  in millions 



  

goodwill resulting from the acquisitions of frontline quantum data in usa and caris made in 2016  will be deductible for tax purposes goodwill resulting from the 2016 acquisition of hanson research and the 2015  acquisitions of bowtech and icm will not be deductible for tax purposes 

financing activities 

financing activities for 2016  reflected net payments on debt of 1631 million  compared with net payments on debt of 476 million  in 2015 and net proceeds from debt of 295 million  for 2014 in addition in both 2015 and 2014 the company issued 1250 million  of senior unsecured notes financing activities in 2016 also included the payment of 116 million for an option contract in connection with the pending e2v acquisition 

fiscal years 2016  2015  and 2014  reflect proceeds from the exercise of stock options of 361 million  190 million  and 183 million  respectively financing activities for 2015 and 2014 also reflected the repurchase of common stock of 2438 million and 1466 million respectively share repurchases totaled 2561815 shares in 2015 and 1396290 shares in 2014 see note 8 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information about our stock repurchase program 

other matters 

pension plans 

teledyne has a domestic qualified defined benefit pension plan covering substantially all us employees hired before january 1 2004 or approximately 16  of teledyne’s active employees as of january 1 2004 new us hires participate in a domestic defined contribution plan in 2016 2015 and 2014 teledyne’s domestic pension plan was over 100 funded thus no cash contributions were made for the company’s domestic pension plan the discount rate for 2017 will decrease to 454 from 491 in 2016 the company also has several smaller domestic and foreignbased defined benefit pension plans 

income taxes 

our income tax expense deferred tax assets and liabilities and reserves for unrecognized tax benefits reflect management’s best assessment of estimated current and future taxes to be paid we are subject to income taxes in both the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions significant judgments and estimates are required in determining the consolidated income tax expense 

deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amount in the financial statements which will result in taxable or deductible amounts in the future in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets within the jurisdiction from which they arise we consider all available positive and negative evidence including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities projected future taxable income taxplanning strategies and 

results of recent operations in projecting future taxable income we begin with historical results adjusted for the results of discontinued operations and incorporate assumptions about the amount of future state federal and foreign pretax operating income adjusted for items that do not have tax consequences the assumptions about future taxable income require significant judgment and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses in evaluating the objective evidence that historical results provide we consider three years of cumulative operating income based on the company’s history of operating earnings expectations of future operating earnings and potential tax planning strategies management believes that it is possible that some portion of deferred taxes will not be realized as a future tax benefit and therefore has recorded a valuation allowance 

we file income tax returns in the united states federal jurisdiction and in various states and foreign jurisdictions the company has substantially concluded on all us federal income tax matters for all years through 2012 california income tax matters for all years through 2011 and canadian income tax matters for all years through 2008 

costs and pricing 

inflationary trends in recent years have been moderate current inventory costs the increasing costs of equipment and other costs are considered in establishing sales pricing policies the company emphasizes cost containment in all aspects of its business 

hedging activities and market risk disclosures 

teledyne transacts business in various foreign currencies and has international sales and expenses denominated in foreign currencies subjecting the company to foreign currency risk the company’s primary objective is to protect the united states dollar value of future cash flows and minimize the volatility of reported earnings the company utilizes foreign currency forward contracts to reduce the volatility of cash flows primarily related to forecasted revenue and expenses denominated in canadian dollars for our canadian companies including dalsa these contracts are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges 

the effectiveness of the cash flow hedge contracts excluding time value is assessed prospectively and retrospectively on a monthly basis using regression analysis as well as using other timing and probability criteria to receive hedge accounting treatment all hedging relationships are formally documented at the inception of the hedges and must be highly effective in offsetting changes to future cash flows on hedged transactions the effective portion of the cash flow hedge contracts’ gains or losses resulting from changes in the fair value of these hedges is initially reported net of tax as a component of accumulated other comprehensive incomeloss  “ aoci ”  in stockholders’ equity until the underlying hedged item is reflected in our consolidated statements of income at which time the effective amount in accumulated other comprehensive income is reclassified to cost of sales in our consolidated statements of income the company expects to reclassify a loss of approximately 08 million net of tax over the next 12 months based on the yearend 2016 exchange rate 

in the event that the gains or losses in aoci are deemed to be ineffective the ineffective portion of gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value if any is reclassified to other income and expense in the event that the underlying forecasted transactions do not occur or it becomes remote that they will occur within the defined hedge period the gains or losses on the related cash flow hedges will be reclassified from aoci to other income and expense during the current reporting period all forecasted transactions occurred and therefore there were no such gains or losses reclassified to other income and expense as of january 1 2017  teledyne had foreign currency forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges to buy canadian dollars and to sell us dollars totaling 568 million  and these contracts had a negative fair value of 11 million  these foreign currency forward contracts have maturities ranging from march 2017 to february 2018 

in addition the company utilizes foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate foreign exchange rate risk associated with foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities including intercompany receivables and payables as of january 1 2017  teledyne had foreign currency contracts of this type in the following currency pairs in millions 



these contracts had a fair value of 54 million  at january 1 2017  the gains and losses on these derivatives which are not designated as hedging instruments are intended to at a minimum partially offset the transaction gains and losses recognized in earnings all derivatives are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value as discussed below the accounting for gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value depends on the use of the derivative and whether it is designated and qualifies for hedge accounting teledyne does not use foreign currency forward contracts for speculative or trading purposes 

notwithstanding our efforts to mitigate portions of our foreign currency exchange rate risks there can be no assurance that our hedging activities will adequately protect us against the risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations a hypothetical 10 appreciation of the us dollar from its value at january 1 2017  would decrease the fair value of our foreign currency forward contracts associated with our cash flow hedging activities by 57 million  a hypothetical 10 depreciation of the us dollar from its value at january 1 2017  would increase the fair value of our foreign currency forward contracts associated with our cash flow hedging activities by 57 million  

borrowings under our credit facility are at fixed rates that vary with the term and timing of each loan under the facility loans under the facility typically have terms of one two three or six months and the interest rate for each such loan is subject to change if the loan is continued or converted following the applicable maturity date interest rates are also subject to change based on our debt to earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization ratio as of january 1 2017  we had no amounts outstanding under our 7500 million credit facility any borrowings under the company’s revolving credit line are based on a fluctuating market interest rate and consequently the fair value of any outstanding debt should not be affected materially by changes in market interest rates 

we believe that adequate controls are in place to monitor any hedging activities our primary exposure to market risk relates to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates we periodically evaluate these risks and have taken measures to mitigate these risks we own assets and operate facilities in countries that have been politically stable 

environmental 

we are subject to various federal state local and international environmental laws and regulations which require that we investigate and remediate the effects of the release or disposal of materials at sites associated with past and present operations these include sites at which teledyne has been identified as a potentially responsible party under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act commonly known as superfund and comparable state laws we are currently involved in the investigation and remediation of a number of sites reserves for environmental investigation and remediation totaled 70 million  at january 1 2017  and 87 million  at january 3 2016  as investigation and remediation of these sites proceed and new information is received the company will adjust accruals to reflect new information based on current information we do not believe that future environmental costs in excess of those already accrued will materially and adversely affect our financial condition or liquidity see also our environmental risk factor disclosure beginning on page 25 and notes 2 and 14 to our notes to consolidated financial statements 

government contracts 

we perform work on a number of contracts with the us department of defense and other agencies and departments of the us government including subcontracts with government prime contractors sales under these contracts with the us government which included contracts with the us department of defense were approximately 27  of total sales in 2016  26  of total sales in 2015  and 25  of total sales in 2014  for a summary of sales to the us government by segment see note 12 to our notes to consolidated financial statements sales to the us department of defense represented approximately 21  19  and 20  of total sales for 2016  2015  and 2014  respectively 

performance under government contracts has certain inherent risks that could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business results of operations and financial condition government contracts are conditioned upon the continuing availability of congressional appropriations which usually occurs on a fiscal year basis even though contract performance may take more than one year see also our government contracts risks factor disclosure beginning on page 19 

for information on accounts receivable from the us government see note 5 to our notes to consolidated financial statements 

estimates and reserves 

our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent liabilities on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including those related to product returns and replacements allowance for doubtful accounts inventories intangible assets income taxes warranty obligations pension and other postretirement benefits longterm contracts environmental workers’ compensation and general liability employee dental and medical benefits and other contingencies and litigation we 

base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances at the time the results of which form the basis for making our judgments actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions in some cases such differences may be material see also critical accounting policies 

the following table reflects significant reserves and valuation accounts which are estimates and based on judgments as described above at january 1 2017  and january 3 2016  in millions 



  

a this table should be read in conjunction with the notes to consolidated financial statements 

b includes both longterm and shortterm reserves 

some of the company’s products are subject to standard warranties and the company provides for the estimated cost of product warranties we regularly assess the adequacy of our preexisting warranty liabilities and adjust amounts as necessary based on a review of historic warranty experience with respect to the applicable business or products as well as the length and actual terms of the warranties which are typically one year the product warranty reserve is included in current accrued liabilities and other longterm liabilities on the balance sheet 



critical accounting policies 

the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with united states generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the notes to the financial statements some of those judgments can be subjective and complex and therefore actual results could differ materially from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions our critical accounting policies are those that are reflective of significant judgment complexity and uncertainty and may potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions we have identified the following as critical accounting policies revenue recognition accounting for pension plans accounting for business combinations goodwill and other longlived assets and accounting for income taxes for additional discussion of the application of these and other accounting policies see note 2 of our notes to consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition 

revenue is recognized when the earnings process is substantially complete and all of the following criteria are met 1 persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists 2 delivery has occurred or services have been rendered 3 our price to our customer is fixed or determinable and 4 collectability is reasonably assured 

we determine the appropriate method by which we recognize revenue by analyzing the terms and conditions of our contracts or arrangements entered into with our customers the majority of our revenue relates to product sales and is recognized upon shipment to the customer at fixed or determinable prices and with a reasonable assurance of collection passage of title to the customer and fulfillment of all significant obligations revenue is recognized net of estimated sales returns and other allowances the company does not offer substantial sales incentives and credits to customers the remaining revenue is generally associated with longterm contracts to design develop and manufacture highly engineered products used in commercial or defense applications such contracts are generally accounted for using contract accounting percentageofcompletion “poc” method 

the company’s standard terms of sale are fob shipping point for a small percentage of sales where title and risk of loss passes at destination point and assuming all other criteria for revenue recognition are met the company recognizes revenue upon delivery to the customer if any significant obligation to the customer with respect to a sales transaction remains following shipment revenue recognition is deferred until such obligations have been fulfilled in general our revenue arrangements do not involve acceptance provisions based on customer specified acceptance criteria in those circumstances when customer specified acceptance criteria exist and if we cannot demonstrate that the system meets those specifications prior to the shipment then revenue is deferred until customer acceptance is obtained 

we have a few contracts that require the company to warehouse certain goods for which revenue is recognized when all risks of loss is borne by the customer and all other criteria for revenue recognition are met 

we also have a small number of multiple elements arrangements ie free product training installation additional parts etc if contract accounting does not apply we allocate the contract price among the deliverables based on vendorspecific objective evidence of fair value to each element in the arrangement if objective and reliable evidence of fair value of any element is not available we use our best estimate of selling price for purposes of allocating the total arrangement consideration among the elements also extended or noncustomary warranties do not represent a significant portion of our revenue however when our revenue arrangements include an extended or noncustomary warranty provision the revenue is deferred and recognized ratably over the extended warranty period 

for contracts that require substantial performance over a long time period generally one or more years revenue is recorded under the poc method we record net revenue and an estimated profit as work on our contracts progresses the poc method for these contracts is dependent on the nature of the contract or products provided depending on the contract we may measure the extent of progress toward completion using the unitsofdelivery method costtocost method or upon attainment of scheduled performance contract milestones which could be time event or expense driven for example for costreimbursable contracts we use the costtocost method to measure progress toward completion under the costtocost method of accounting we recognize revenue and an estimated profit as allowable costs are incurred based on the proportion that the incurred costs bear to total estimated costs another example for contracts that require us to provide a substantial number of similar items we record revenue and an estimated profit on a poc basis using unitsofdelivery as the basis to measure progress toward completing the contract occasionally it is appropriate to combine individual customer orders and treat them as one arrangement when the underlying agreement was reached with the customer for a single large project 

accounting for contracts using the poc method requires management judgment relative to assessing risks estimating contract revenue and cost and making assumptions for schedule and technical issues contract revenue may include estimated amounts not contractually agreed to by the customer including price redetermination cost or performance incentives such as award and incentives fees unpriced change orders claims and requests for equitable adjustment the poc method requires management’s judgment to make reasonably dependable cost estimates generally over a long time period since certain contracts extend over a long period of time the impact of revisions in cost and revenue estimates during the progress of work may adjust the current period earnings on a cumulative catchup basis this method recognizes in the current period the cumulative effect of the changes on current and prior quarters additionally if the current contract estimate indicates a loss a provision is made for the total anticipated loss in the period that it becomes evident contract cost and revenue estimates for significant contracts are generally reviewed and reassessed at least quarterly 

we do not believe that any discrete event or adjustment to an individual contract within the aggregate changes in contract estimates for 2016  2015  or 2014  was material to the consolidated statements of income for such annual periods

teledyne has a domestic qualified defined benefit pension plan covering substantially all us employees hired before january 1 2004 or approximately 16  of teledyne’s active employees as of january 1 2004 new us hires participate in a defined contribution plan only the company also has several smaller domestic and foreignbased defined benefit pension plans at january 1 2017 the benefit obligation for the domestic defined benefit pension plans totaled 8109 million and the fair value of the net qualified plan assets totaled 8571 million at january 1 2017 the benefit obligation for the foreignbased pension plans totaled 514 million and the fair value of the net plan assets totaled 421 million the company’s accounting for its defined benefit pension plans requires that amounts recognized in financial statements be determined on an actuarial basis rather than as contributions are made to the plan in consultation with our actuaries we determine the appropriate assumptions for use in determining the liability for future pension benefits net actuarial gains or losses are amortized to expense on a planbyplan basis when they exceed the accounting corridor the accounting corridor is a defined range within which amortization of net gains and losses is not required and is equal to 10 percent of the greater of the market related value of assets or benefit obligations gains or losses outside of the corridor are subject to amortization over our average employee future service period of approximately nine years significant assumptions used in determining the company’s pension income or expense is the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets participant mortality estimates expected rates of increase in future compensation levels employee turnover as well as the assumed discount rate on pension obligations the company has assumed based upon the types of securities the domestic qualified pension plan assets are invested in and the longterm historical returns of these investments that the longterm expected return on the domestic qualified pension plan assets will be 80  in 2017 and the assumed discount rate for determining benefit obligations will be 454  in 2017 the company’s longterm expected return on the domestic qualified pension assets used in 2016  was 80 and the assumed discount rate used in 2016  was 491  the actual rate of return on the domestic qualified pension plan assets was 709 in 2016  and a negative return of 11 in 2015  for its domestic qualified pension plan if the actual rate of return on pension assets is below the expected rate of return the company may be required to make additional contributions to the pension trust at january 1 2017 the domestic qualified pension plan is overfunded and contributions are not required the company did not make any cash contributions to its domestic qualified pension plan since 2013 when it made a voluntary pretax cash contribution of 830 million  before recovery from the us government each year beginning with 2014 the society of actuaries released revised mortality tables which updated life expectancy assumptions in consideration of these tables we updated the mortality assumptions used in determining our pension obligations the net impact of these new mortality assumptions has resulted in an increase to our pension obligation and an increase in future pension expense our plan remains overfunded after the impact of the new mortality assumptions as well as from changes to other relevant assumptions at yearend 2016  the company has a 2496 million  noncash reduction to stockholders’ equity and a longterm additional liability of 3969 million  related to its pension plans at yearend 2015  the company had a 2323 million  noncash reduction to stockholders’ equity and a longterm additional liability of 3704 million  related to its pension plans 

differences in the discount rate and expected longterm rate of return on assets within the indicated range would have had the following impact on 2016  pension expense in millions

business combinations goodwill and acquired intangible assets 

the results for all acquisitions are included in the company’s consolidated financial statements from the date of each respective acquisition business acquisitions are accounted for under the acquisition method by assigning the purchase price to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at their fair values and the excess of the purchase price over the amounts assigned is recorded as goodwill we determine the fair value of such assets and liabilities generally in consultation with thirdparty valuation advisors acquired intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives adjustments to fair value assessments are recorded to goodwill over the purchase price allocation period 

goodwill and acquired intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized we review goodwill and acquired indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable the company also performs an annual impairment test in the fourth quarter of each year we would test goodwill and acquired indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment between annual tests if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce our enterprise fair value below its book value these events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate including a significant sustained decline in 

an entity’s market value legal factors operating performance indicators competition sale or disposition of a significant portion of the business or other factors based on an annual impairment test completed in 2016  there was no impairment to acquired intangible assets based on a quarterly impairment test completed in 2016 the company recorded a 10 million impairment to acquired intangible assets based on a quarterly impairment test completed in 2015 the company recorded a 05 million impairment to acquired intangible assets no impairment of goodwill was indicated in 2016 or 2015 based on the annual impairment test completed in the fourth quarter of each year 

for goodwill impairment testing the company estimates the fair value of the reporting units using a discounted cash flow model based on our best estimate of amounts and timing of future revenues and cash flows and our most recent business and strategic plans and compares the estimated fair value to the carrying value of the reporting unit including goodwill the discounted cash flow model requires judgmental assumptions about projected revenue growth future operating margins discount rates and terminal values over a multiyear period there are inherent uncertainties related to these assumptions and management’s judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill impairment while the company believes it has made reasonable estimates and assumptions to calculate the fair value of its reporting units it is possible a material change could occur if actual results are not consistent with management’s estimates and assumptions goodwill may be overstated and a charge would need to be taken against net earnings 

as of january 1 2017  the company had 17 reporting units for goodwill impairment testing the carrying value of goodwill included in the company’s individual reporting units ranges from 10 million to 4225 million the company’s analysis in 2016 indicated that in all instances the fair value of the company’s reporting units exceeded their carrying values and consequently did not result in an impairment charge the excess of the estimated fair value over the carrying value expressed as a percentage of carrying value of the respective reporting unit for each of the company’s reporting units as of the fourth quarter of 2016 the annual testing date ranged from approximately 19 to 4873 

changes in these projections could affect the estimated fair value of certain of the company’s reporting units and could result in a goodwill impairment charge in a future period in order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations used in the goodwill impairment test the company applied a hypothetical 10 decrease to the fair values of each reporting unit and compared those values to the reporting unit carrying values based on this sensitivity analysis the company did not identify any goodwill impairment due to the many variables inherent in the estimation of a reporting unit’s fair value and the relative size of our recorded goodwill differences in assumptions may have a material effect on the results of our impairment analysis 

the impairment test for indefinitelived intangibles other than goodwill primarily trademarks and trade names consists of a comparison of the fair value of the indefinitelived intangible asset to the carrying value of the asset as of the impairment testing date the company estimates the fair value of its indefinitelived intangibles using a discounted cash flow model based on our best estimate of amounts and timing of future revenues from our most recent business and strategic plans and compares the estimated fair value to the carrying value of the asset without exception the estimated fair values exceed the carrying value for each of the company’s indefinitelived intangible assets as of the fourth quarter of 2016  the annual testing date 

income taxes 

income tax expense and deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect management’s assessment of actual future taxes to be paid on items reflected in the financial statements significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes uncertainty exists regarding tax positions taken in previously filed tax returns still under examination and positions expected to be taken in the current year and future returns deferred tax assets and liabilities arise due to differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and tax carryforwards although we believe our income tax expense and deferred tax assets and liabilities are reasonable no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome will not be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals to the extent that the final tax outcome is different than the amounts recorded such differences will impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made the provision for income taxes includes the impact of uncertain tax benefits that are considered appropriate as well as the related net interest 

significant judgment is required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets in assessing the need for a valuation allowance we consider all available evidence including past operating results estimates of future taxable income and the feasibility of tax planning strategies in the event that we change our determination as to the amount of deferred tax assets that can be realized we will adjust our valuation allowance with a corresponding impact to the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made 

we record uncertain tax benefits on the basis of a twostep process whereby 1 we determine whether it is more likely than not that the tax positions will be sustained on the basis of the technical merits of the positions and 2 for those tax positions that meet the “morelikelythannot” recognition threshold we recognize the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50 percent likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement with the related tax authority 

an increase of 100 basis point increase in our nominal tax rate would have resulted in additional income tax provision for the fiscal year ended january 1 2017 of 24 million for a description of the company’s tax accounting policies refer to note 2 and note 10 of our notes to the consolidated financial statements

safe harbor cautionary statement regarding forwardlooking information 

this management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation contains forwardlooking statements as defined in the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 directly and indirectly relating to earnings growth opportunities acquisitions and divestitures product sales capital expenditures pension matters stock option compensation expense the credit facility interest expense severance and relocation costs environmental remediation cost stock repurchases taxes exchange rate fluctuations and strategic plans all statements made in this management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation that are not historical in nature should be considered forwardlooking actual results could differ materially from these forwardlooking statements 

many factors could change the anticipated results including disruptions in the global economy changes in demand for products sold to the defense electronics instrumentation digital imaging energy exploration and production commercial aviation semiconductor and communications markets funding continuation and award of government programs and cuts to defense spending resulting from existing and future deficit reduction measures risks associated with our pending acquisition of e2v including the failure to satisfy closing conditions and the failure to successfully integrate the business impacts from the united kingdom’s decision to exit the european union uncertainties related to the policies of the new us presidential administration and threats to the security of our confidential and proprietary information including cyber security threats continued lower oil and natural gas prices as well as instability in the middle east or other oil producing regions and new regulations or restrictions relating to energy production including with respect to hydraulic fracturing could further   negatively affect our businesses that supply the oil and gas industry increasing fuel costs could negatively affect the markets of our commercial aviation businesses in addition financial market fluctuations affect the value of our pension assets changes in the policies of us and foreign governments could result over time in reductions or realignment in defense or other government spending and further changes in programs in which the company participates 

while teledyne’s growth strategy includes possible acquisitions including the pending e2v transaction we cannot provide any assurance as to when if or on what terms any acquisitions will be made acquisitions involve various inherent risks such as among others our ability to integrate acquired businesses retain customers and achieve identified financial and operating synergies there are additional risks associated with acquiring owning and operating businesses outside of the united states including those arising from us and foreign government policy changes or actions and exchange rate fluctuations 

we continue to take action to assure compliance with the internal controls disclosure controls and other requirements of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 while we believe our control systems are effective there are inherent limitations in all control systems and misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and may not be detected 

additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in the forwardlooking statements is contained beginning on page 13 of this form 10k under the caption “risk factors cautionary statement as to forwardlooking statements” forwardlooking statements are generally accompanied by words such as “estimate” “project” “predict” “believes” or “expect” that convey the uncertainty of future events or outcomes we assume no obligation to publicly update or revise any forwardlooking statements whether as a result of new information or otherwise

customers 

we have hundreds of customers in the various industries we serve no commercial customer accounted for more than 10 of our total sales nor more than 10 of any segment sales during 2015  2014  or 2013  our largest commercial customer a customer of our instrumentation segment accounted for 23  28  and 36  of total sales in 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively 

sales to international customers accounted for approximately 44  of total sales in 2015  compared with 45  in 2014  and 44  in 2013  in 2015  we sold products to customers in over 100 foreign countries approximately 90 of our sales to foreignbased customers were made to customers in 25 foreign countries the 2015  top five countries for international sales were the united kingdom  norway  china  germany  and south korea  and constituted approximately 21  of our total sales 

approximately 26  25  and 27  of our total sales for 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively were derived from contracts with agencies of and prime contractors to the us government information on our sales to the us government including direct sales as a prime contractor and indirect sales as a subcontractor is as follows in millions 



our principal us government customer is the us department of defense these sales represented 19  20  and 21  of our total sales for 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively in 2015 our largest program with the us government was the engineering solutions and prototyping contract with the nasa marshall space flight center which represented 15 of our total sales in 2014 and 2013 our largest program with the us government was the objective simulation framework contract with the missile defense agency which represented 13 and 14 of our total sales respectively 

as described under risk factors there are risks associated with doing business with the us government in 2015  approximately 54  of our us government prime contracts and subcontracts were fixedprice type contracts compared to 58  in 2014  and 60  in 2013  under these types of contracts we bear the inherent risk that actual performance cost may exceed the fixed contract price such contracts are typically not subject to renegotiation of profits if we fail to anticipate technical problems estimate costs accurately or control costs during performance additionally us government contracts are subject to termination by the us government at its convenience without identification of any default when contracts are terminated for convenience we typically recover costs incurred or committed settlement expenses and profit on work completed prior to termination we had eight  us government contracts terminated for convenience in 2015  compared with three  in 2014  and four  in 2013  

our total backlog of confirmed orders was approximately 8028 million  at january 3 2016  compared with 9446 million  at december 28 2014  and 9412 million  at december 29 2013  we expect to fulfill 96  of such backlog of confirmed orders during 2016 

seasonality 

no material portion of our business is considered to be seasonal 

raw materials and suppliers 

generally our businesses have experienced minimal fluctuations in the supply of raw materials but not without some price volatility while some of our businesses provide services for those businesses that sell hardware and product a portion of the value that we provide is labororiented such as design engineering assembly and test activities in manufacturing our products we use our own production capabilities and also third party suppliers and subcontractors including international sources some of the items we use for the manufacture of our products including certain gyro components for some marine navigation applications certain magnets and helix wire for our traveling wave tubes and certain infrared detectors substrates certain ceramics and molding compounds used in our sonar systems as well as certain scintillator materials used in the production of our xray detectors are purchased from limited or single sources including international sources due to technical capability price and other factors while over the years we have not experienced much difficulty in procuring raw materials components subassemblies and other supplies required in our manufacturing processes disruption in the global economy and financial markets could trigger increased pricing or otherwise affect our suppliers and negatively impact our ability to procure such supplies 

sales and marketing 

our sales and marketing approach varies by segment and by products within our segments a shared fundamental tenet is the commitment to work closely with our customers to understand their needs with an aim to secure preferred supplier and longerterm relationships 

our segments use a combination of internal sales forces thirdparty distributors and commissioned sales representatives to market and sell our products and services our teledyne instruments companies and other businesses have been working over the years to consolidate or share internal sales and servicing efforts several teledyne businesses have been marketing and selling products collaboratively to similar customers to promote “onestop” shopping under singular “brand” names including teledyne marine teledyne oil  gas teledyne water quality and teledyne microwave solutions 

products are also advertised in appropriate trade journals and by means of various websites to promote our products and other capabilities our personnel regularly participate in relevant trade shows and professional associations 

many of our government contracts are awarded after a competitive bidding process in which we seek to emphasize our ability to provide superior products and technical solutions in addition to competitive pricing 

through teledyne technologies international corp and other subsidiaries we have established offices in foreign countries to facilitate international sales for various businesses locations include brazil china france germany italy japan malaysia singapore south korea switzerland and the united arab emirates 

competition 

we believe that technological capabilities and innovation and the ability to invest in the development of new and enhanced products are critical to obtaining and maintaining leadership in our markets and the industries in which we compete although we have certain advantages that we believe help us compete effectively in our markets each of our markets is highly competitive with regard to our defense businesses it is common in the defense industry for work on programs to be shared among a number of companies including competitors in any event because of the diversity of products sold and the number of markets we serve we encounter a wide variety of competitors none of which we believe offer all of the same product and service lines or serve all of the same markets as we do our businesses vigorously compete on the basis of quality product performance and reliability technical expertise price and service many of our competitors have and potential competitors could have greater name recognition a larger installed base of products more extensive engineering manufacturing marketing and distribution capabilities and greater financial technological and personnel resources than we do 

research and development 

our research and development efforts primarily involve engineering and design related to improving existing products and developing new products and technologies in the same or similar fields we spent a total of 4766 million  in 2015  4288 million  in 2014  and 3882 million  in 2013  on research and development and bid and proposal costs customerfunded research and development most of which was attributable to work under contracts with the us government represented approximately 66  of total research and development costs for 2015  compared with 61  of total research and development costs for 2014  and 57  in 2013  

in 2015  we incurred 1637 million  in companyfunded research and development and bid and proposal costs we expect the level of companyfunded research and development and bid and proposal costs to be approximately 1750 million  in 2016 

intellectual property 

while we own and control various intellectual property rights including patents trade secrets confidential information trademarks trade names and copyrights which in the aggregate are of material importance to our business we believe that our business as a whole is not materially dependent upon any one intellectual property or related group of such properties we own several hundred active patents and are licensed to use certain patents technology and other intellectual property rights owned and controlled by others similarly other companies are licensed to use certain patents technology and other intellectual property rights owned and controlled by us 

patents patent applications and license agreements will expire or terminate over time by operation of law in accordance with their terms or otherwise we do not expect the expiration or termination of these patents patent applications and license agreements to have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

employees 

we consider our relations with our employees to be good at january 3 2016  our total workforce consisted of approximately 9200  employees of which approximately 7000  employees were located in the united states

risk factors cautionary statement as to forwardlooking statements 

the following text highlights various risks and uncertainties associated with teledyne these factors could materially affect “forwardlooking statements” within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 that we may make from time to time including forwardlooking statements contained in “item 1 business” and “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” of this form 10k and in teledyne’s 2015  annual report to stockholders it is not possible for management to predict all such factors and new factors may emerge additionally management cannot assess the impact of each such factor on teledyne or the extent to which any factor or combination of factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forwardlooking statements 

  

a new global recession continued economic uncertainty in europe or an economic downturn in china may adversely affect us 

if another global recession emerges if economic uncertainty in europe continues or worsens or if economic growth in china substantially slows we may experience declines in revenues profitability and cash flows from reduced orders payment delays collection difficulties increased price pressures for our products increased risk of excess and obsolete inventories or other factors caused by the economic problems of customers if negative conditions in the global credit markets prevent our customers’ access to credit or render them insolvent orders for our products may decrease which would result in lower revenue likewise if our suppliers face challenges in obtaining credit in selling their products or otherwise in operating their businesses or remaining solvent they may become unable to offer the materials we use to manufacture our products these events could adversely impact our ability to manufacture affected products and could also result in reductions in our revenue increased price competition and increased operating costs which could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we develop and manufacture products for customers in the energy exploration and production markets domestic and international commercial aerospace markets the semiconductor industry the consumer electronics telecommunications and automotive industries each of which has been cyclical exhibited rapid changes and suffered from fluctuating market demands a cyclical downturn in these markets may materially affect future operating results in 2015 for example our revenue and income were negatively impacted by the downturn in energy markets 

in addition we sell products and services to customers in industries that are sensitive to the level of general economic activity and consumer spending habits and in more mature industries that are sensitive to capacity adverse economic conditions affecting these industries may reduce demand for our products and services which may reduce our revenues profits or production levels for example in 2014 several of our major customers reduced their marine seismic operations in connection with a general slowdown in the marine seismic exploration industry some of our businesses serve industries such as power generation and petrochemical refining which may be negatively impacted by reductions in global capital expenditures and manufacturing capacity 

a material amount of our total revenues is derived from companies in the oil and gas industry especially the offshore oil and gas industry a historically cyclical industry with levels of activity that are significantly affected by the levels and volatility of oil and gas prices 

a material amount of our total revenues is derived from customers in or connected to the oil and gas exploration development and production especially the offshore oil and gas industry our largest commercial customer is in the offshore oil and gas industry and accounted for 23  28  and 36  of total sales in 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively the oil and gas industry is a historically cyclical industry characterized by significant changes in the levels of exploration and development activities in 2014 and again in 2015 and 2016 the price of brent crude oil experienced dramatic declines from a high of 116 in june 2014 to a low of 27 in january 2016 oil and gas prices and market expectations of potential changes in those prices significantly affect the levels of those activities worldwide political economic and military events have contributed to oil and gas price volatility and are likely to continue to do so in the future any prolonged reduction in the overall level of offshore oil and gas exploration and development activities whether resulting from changes in oil and gas prices or otherwise could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations of our businesses within our instrumentation segment some factors that have affected and are likely to continue affecting oil and gas prices and the level of demand for our services and products include the following 

 our 2014 acquisition of bolt increased our exposure to offshore oil and gas exploration markets teledyne manufactures seismic sources interconnects and data acquisition products used in offshore energy exploration when crude oil and natural gas prices are low the level of marine seismic exploration activity typically decreases potentially resulting in reduced demand for our products used in offshore energy exploration in addition a decline in the level of capital spending by oil and natural gas companies may result in a reduced pace of development of new energy reserves which could adversely affect demand for our products related to energy production and in certain instances result in the cancellation modification or rescheduling of existing orders 

we are subject to the risks associated with international sales and international operations which could harm our business or results of operations 

during 2015  sales to international customers accounted for approximately 44  of our total revenues compared with 45  in 2014  and 44  in 2013  in 2015  we sold products to customers in over 100 countries the 2015  top five countries for international sales were the united kingdom  norway  china  germany  and south korea  constituting 21  of our total sales our acquisitions including bowtech and icm in 2015 bolt in 2014 reson in 2013 lecroy in 2012 and dalsa in 2011 contributed to greater international sales we anticipate that future sales to international customers will continue to account for a significant and increasing percentage of our revenues particularly since business and growth plans for many teledyne businesses focus on sales outside of the united states including to emerging markets such as china brazil and west africa 

risks associated with international sales include but are not limited to 

 14 

 any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition exchange rate fluctuations may negatively affect the cost of our products to international customers and therefore reduce our competitive position given our several canadabased businesses volatility in the value of the canadian dollar relative to the us dollar or other foreign currencies could adversely affect the business operations and the financial condition of our digital imaging segment our united kingdom “uk”based businesses and sales to customers in the uk could be adversely impacted by uncertainty related to continued uk membership in the european union and continued austerity measures imposed by the uk government 

sales of our products and services internationally are subject to us and local government regulations and procurement policies and practices including regulations relating to importexport control violations of export control rules could result in the impositions of fines and penalties or the suspension of our ability to export items from one or more businesses or the entire corporation depending on the scope of the suspension this could have a material effect on our ability to perform certain international contracts 

among other things we are subject to the us foreign corrupt practices act or fcpa which generally prohibits us companies and their intermediaries from bribing foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or keeping business or otherwise obtaining favorable treatment further in 2011 the united kingdom also implemented the uk bribery act which raised the bar for antibribery law enforcement and compliance relative to the fcpa any determination that we had violated the fcpa the uk bribery act or equivalent antibribery and corruption laws in countries in which we do business could result in sanctions that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations while we have procedures and compliance programs in place and conduct fcpa and other trainings we cannot provide assurance that our internal controls will always protect us from misconduct by our employees agents or business partners 

our international operations are subject to risks customarily encountered in foreign operations including interruption to transportation flows for delivery of parts to us and finished goods to our customers changes in a specific country’s or region’s political or economic conditions trade protection measures import or export licensing requirements consequences from changes in tax laws and regulatory requirements difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations differing labor regulations differing protection of intellectual property and geopolitical turmoil including terrorism and war we are also exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk inherent in our sales commitments anticipated sales and expenses and assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the local functional currency and may also become subject to interest rate risk inherent in any debt we incur or financial investments we hold 

acquisitions involve inherent risks that may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

our growth strategy includes acquisitions acquisitions involve various inherent risks such as 

 while we conduct financial and other due diligence in connection with our acquisitions and generally seek some form of protection including indemnification from a seller and sometimes an escrow of a portion of the purchase price to cover potential issues such acquired companies may have weaknesses or liabilities that are not accurately assessed or brought to our attention at the time of the acquisition further indemnities or escrows may not fully cover such matters particularly matters identified after a closing 

as they have over the last few years acquisitions may also change the nature and level of various risks faced by teledyne for example our acquisition of bolt in 2014 increased our exposure to the offshore energy exploration market the bolt acquisition the dalsa acquisition in 2011 and the lecroy acquisition in 2012 increased the percentage of sales attributable to commercial customers as opposed to the us government these acquisitions coupled with our other recently acquired companies located outside of the united states also increased the percentage of revenues and expenses that arise from international sources and consequently our exposure to us and foreign policy changes and exchange rate fluctuations additionally both dalsa’s and lecroy’s businesses have been more capital intensive than other teledyne businesses increasing teledyne’s capital requirements 

under sec rules teledyne must issue a report on management’s assessment of the effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting the sec permits a limited timebased exclusion for acquisitions to give a company an opportunity to evaluate more fully the internal controls of acquired companies and correct deficiencies and institute new or additional internal controls our 2015 management’s report specifically excludes from its scope and coverage our 2015 acquisitions of bowtech and icm allowing us additional time to evaluate existing internal controls and implement additional controls as appropriate with regard to future acquisitions we can provide no assurance that we will be able to provide a report that contains no significant deficiencies or material weaknesses with respect to these acquired companies or other acquisitions 

in connection with our acquisitions including ones which we do not complete we may incur significant transaction costs we are required to expense as incurred such transaction costs which may have a material adverse impact on our quarterly financial results further the acquisitions of public companies such as bolt and lecroy now routinely trigger purported class action lawsuits filed by shareholders of the target companies the defense of which has increased transaction costs among other things 

changes in future business conditions could cause business investments goodwill and other longlived assets to become impaired resulting in significant losses and writedowns that would reduce our operating income 

on january 3 2016  teledyne’s goodwill was 11402 million  and net acquired intangible assets were 2433 million  under current accounting guidance we are required to test annually both acquired goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment based upon a fair value approach rather than amortizing them over time we have chosen to perform our annual impairment reviews of goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year we also are required to test goodwill for impairment between annual tests if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce our enterprise fair value below its book value these events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate including a significant sustained decline in an entity’s market value legal factors operating performance indicators competition sale or disposition of a significant portion of the business or other factors if the fair market value is less than the carrying value including goodwill we could be required to record an impairment charge the valuation of reporting units requires judgment in estimating future cash flows discount rates and estimated product life cycles in making these judgments we evaluate the financial health of the business including such factors as industry performance changes in technology and operating cash flows as we have grown through acquisitions the amount of goodwill and net acquired intangible assets is significant compared with our total assets as a result the amount of any annual or interim impairment could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our reported financial results for the period in which the charge is taken we also may be required to record an earnings charge or incur unanticipated expenses if as a result of a change in strategy or other reason we were to determine the value of other assets had been impaired 

united states and global responses to terrorism continuing turmoil in middle eastern countries concerns regarding nuclear proliferation and the safety of nuclear energy potential epidemics financial issues facing airlines and volatile energy prices increase uncertainties with respect to many of our businesses and may adversely affect our business and results of operations 

united states’ and global responses to terrorism continuing turmoil in middle eastern countries and nuclear proliferation concerns increase uncertainties with respect to us and other business and financial markets and could adversely affect our business and operations 

air travel declines have occurred after terrorist attacks and heightened security alerts as well as after the highprofile outbreaks of disease while travel by our sales and service personnel to various regions has been affected by such factors additional declines in air travel resulting from such factors and other factors could adversely affect the financial condition of many of our commercial airline and aircraft manufacturer customers and in turn could adversely affect our aerospace and defense electronics segment the 2015 paris terrorist attacks or the syrian refugee crisis could result in governments in europe imposing greater restrictions on the movement of personnel or goods which could adversely impact our businesses located within the european union or our ability to sell products in that region in addition a prolonged virus epidemic or pandemic or the threat thereof could result in worker absences lower productivity voluntary closure of our offices and manufacturing facilities disruptions in our supply chain travel restrictions on our employees and other disruptions to our businesses 

moreover health epidemics may force local health and government authorities to mandate the temporary closure of our offices and manufacturing facilities 

deterioration of financial performance of airlines could result in a reduction of discretionary spending for upgrades of avionics and inflight communications equipment which would adversely affect our aerospace and defense electronics segment 

higher oil prices could adversely affect commercial airlinerelated customers of our aerospace and defense electronics segment conversely lower oil prices have decreased oil exploration and petrochemical refining activities and have hindered our marine and other instrumentation businesses in addition instability in the middle east or other oilproducing regions could adversely affect expansion plans of the oil and gas industry customers of our instrumentation and cable solutions businesses 

our revenue from government contracts subjects us to many risks 

our revenue from us government contracts depends on the continued availability of funding from the us government and accordingly we have the risk that funding for our existing contracts may be canceled or diverted to other uses or delayed 

we perform work on a number of contracts with the us department of defense and other agencies and departments of the us government including subcontracts with government prime contractors sales under contracts with the us government as a whole including sales under contracts with the us department of defense as prime contractor or subcontractor represented approximately 26  of our total revenue in 2015  compared with 25  in 2014  and 27  in 2013  performance under government contracts has inherent risks that could have a material effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

government contracts are conditioned upon the continuing availability of congressional appropriations and the failure of congress to appropriate funds for programs in which we participate could negatively affect our results of operations the us government shutdown during 2013 negatively affected many of our businesses and the failure by congress to approve future budgets on a timely basis could delay procurement of our products and services and cause us to lose future revenues additionally defense spending is expected to continue to decline in some areas over the next few years a continued emphasis on federal deficit and debt reduction could lead to a further decrease in overall defense spending the continued war on terrorism also could result in a diversion of funds from programs in which teledyne participates budgetary concerns could result in future contracts being awarded more on price than on other competitive factors and smaller defense budgets could result in government insourcing of programs and more intense competition on programs that are not insourced which could result in lower revenues and profits 

the sequestration provision of the budget control act of 2011 originally imposed 500 billion of defense cuts over nine years starting in fiscal year 2013 which represented approximately 9 of planned defense funding over the period on november 2 2015 the president signed the bipartisan budget act of 2015 the budget act the budget act raises the statutory limit on the amount of permissible federal debt the debt ceiling until march 2017 and raises the sequester caps imposed by the budget control act of 2011 by 800 billion split equally between defense and domestic spending over the next two years on december 18 2015 congress passed and the president signed the consolidated appropriations act of 2016 which provides funding for the us government for the government’s 2016 fiscal year providing 11 trillion in discretionary funding for federal agencies through september 2016 

continued defense spending does not necessarily correlate to continued business for us because not all of the programs in which we participate or have current capabilities may be provided with continued funding changes in policy and budget priorities by the president his administration and the us congress for various defense and nasa programs could continue to impact our engineered systems aerospace and defense electronics and digital imaging segments for example changes in national space policy that affect nasa’s budget have occurred there have also been significant reductions in missile defense budgets our engineered systems segment may be further impacted by delays in production runs under the jassm and harpoon missile programs as well as us department of defense directives to introduce competitive bidding for programs on which we have previously served as sole source the timing of program cycles can affect our results of operations for a particular quarter or year and cancellations of significant programs such as the objective simulation framework “osf” or the shallow water combat submersible “swcs” would affect our results it is also not uncommon for the us department of defense to delay the timing of awards for major programs for six to twelve months reductions and delays in research and development funding by the us government may continue to impact our revenues as darpa reviews its programs aimed to technologically enhance us military capabilities and national security changes to the darpa research and technology development programs in which we participate could occur the upcoming 2016 presidential election could also generate uncertainty or congressional inaction that results in further delay in funding and timing of awards that could have a material impact on our revenues in 2016 finally various us department of defense initiatives such as the emphasis on insourcing positions to the government and anticipated reductions or cancellations of existing programs could negatively impact our engineered systems segment 

our participation in government programs may decrease or be subject to renegotiation as those programs evolve over time 

the us government has been placing emphasis on small business quotas and increasing small business contract set asides and minimum work percentages in some cases prime contractors are required to reduce participation by large subcontractors like teledyne in order to fill small business quotas and be responsive to proposals and bids as a result our engineered systems segment could be significantly impacted 

over time and for a variety of reasons programs can evolve and affect the extent of our participation we have been a significant participant in nasa programs primarily through our engineered systems segment and through teledyne scientific company the current administration introduced significant changes to the national space policy including the cancellation of the nasa’s constellation program which includes ares launch vehicles teledyne brown engineering is developing the muses an earth imaging platform as part of our commercial spacebased digital imaging business the muses platform depends on continued operation of the iss and we may not be successful in developing the technology or commercial relationships necessary to make this investment profitable while most recently in early 2014 we were awarded a fiveyear 60 million contract by nasa’s marshall space flight center to develop and manufacture the launch vehicle stage adapter for the space launch system failure to further transition our business successfully could result in reduced sales in addition delayed funding and changes in support for nasa’s current space policy could negatively impact our business the outcome of the upcoming 2016 presidential election could also lead to changes to the nation’s space policy some or all of which could materially impact our results 

our contracts with the us government are subject to termination rights that could adversely affect us 

most of our us government contracts are subject to termination by the us government either at its convenience or upon the default of the contractor termination for convenience provisions provide only for the recovery of costs incurred or committed settlement expenses and profit on work completed prior to termination termination for default clauses impose liability on the contractor for excess costs incurred by the us government in reprocuring undelivered items from another source we had eight  us government contracts terminated for convenience in 2015  compared with three  in 2014  and four  in 2013  no contracts were terminated for default during such threeyear period 

we may lose money or generate less than expected profits on our fixedprice government contracts and we may lose money if we fail to meet certain prespecified targets in government contracts 

there is no guarantee that us government contracts will be profitable a number of our us government prime contracts and subcontracts are fixedprice type contracts  54  of our total us government contracts were fixedprice in 2015  58  in 2014  and 60  in 2013  under these types of contracts we bear the inherent risk that actual performance cost may exceed the fixed contract price under such contracts we must absorb cost overruns notwithstanding the difficulty of estimating all of the costs we will incur in performing these contracts we cannot assure that our contract loss provisions in our financial statements will be adequate to cover all actual future losses we may lose money or generate lower profits on some contracts if we fail to meet these estimates 

our business is subject to government contracting regulations and our failure to comply with such laws and regulations could harm our operating results and prospects 

we like other government contractors are subject to various audits reviews and investigations including private party “whistleblower” lawsuits relating to our compliance with federal and state laws more routinely the us government may audit the costs we incur on our us government contracts including allocated indirect costs such audits could result in adjustments to our contract costs any costs found to be improperly allocated to a specific contract will not be reimbursed and such costs already reimbursed would need to be refunded we have recorded contract revenues based upon costs we expect to realize on final audit in a worst case scenario should a business or division involved be charged with wrongdoing or should the us government determine that the business or division is not a “presently responsible contractor” that business or division and conceivably our company as a whole could be temporarily suspended or in the event of a conviction could be debarred for up to three years from receiving new government contracts or governmentapproved subcontracts in addition we could expend substantial amounts defending against such charges and in damages fines and penalties if such charges were proven or were to result in negotiated settlements 

our indebtedness and any failure to comply with our covenants that apply to our indebtedness could materially and adversely affect our business 

as of january 3 2016  we had 7655 million  in total outstanding indebtedness this indebtedness included 4250 million  in senior unsecured notes 1900 million  in term loans and 1505 million  under our 7500 million  2015amended credit facility our indebtedness could harm our business by among other things reducing the funds available to make new strategic acquisitions or reducing our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and market conditions our indebtedness exposes us to interest rate risk since a portion of our debt obligations are at variable rates our indebtedness could also have a material adverse effect on our business by increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions or a downturn in our business general adverse economic and industry conditions or a downturn in our business could result in our inability to repay this indebtedness in a timely manner 

our pension expense and the value of our pension assets are affected by factors outside of our control including the performance of plan assets the stock market interest rates and actuarial experience 

we have a defined benefit qualified pension plan covering most of our us employees hired prior to 2004 or approximately 18 of our active employees the value of the combined pension assets is currently greater than our qualified pension benefit obligation the accounting rules applicable to our qualified pension plan require that amounts recognized in the financial statements be determined on an actuarial basis rather than as contributions are made to the plan two significant elements in determining our pension income or pension expense are the expected return on plan assets and the discount rate used in projecting pension benefit obligations declines in the stock market and lower rates of return could increase required contributions to our qualified pension plan andor result in a change to shareholders’ equity our investment strategy may not produce the expected returns if the credit financial or stock markets deteriorate any decreases or increases in market interest rates will affect the discount rate assumption used in projecting pension benefit obligations in addition changes in other actuarial assumptions such as mortality assumptions or change due to legislative or regulatory actions could impact our pension income or expense as well as funding obligations recently the society of actuaries released revised mortality tables which update life expectancy assumptions in consideration of these tables we modified the mortality assumptions used in determining our pension and postretirement benefit obligations as of december 28 2014 which will have a related impact on our future pension and postretirement benefit expense in 2013  we made a voluntary pretax cash contribution of 830 million  to the domestic pension plan no contributions were made to the domestic pension plan in 2015 or 2014 if and to the extent decreases in our pension assets are not offset by voluntary contributions recovered through future asset returns mitigated by an increase in the rate at which the benefit obligation is discounted or other actions our required cash contributions and pension expense could increase under the plans for additional discussion of pension matters see the discussion under “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition” and notes 2 and 11 to our notes to consolidated financial statements 

our business and operations could suffer in the event of cyber security breaches 

attempts by others to gain unauthorized access to our information technology systems have become more sophisticated and are sometimes successful these attempts which might be related to industrial or foreign government espionage activism or other motivations include covertly introducing malware to our computers and networks performing reconnaissance impersonating authorized users stealing corrupting or restricting our access to data among other activities we continue to update our infrastructure security tools and processes to protect against security incidents including both external and internal threats and to prevent their recurrence company personnel and third parties have been tasked to detect and investigate such incidents but it is possible that we might not prevent or be aware of an incident or its magnitude and effects the theft corruption unauthorized use or publication of our intellectual property andor confidential business information could harm our competitive position reduce the value of our investment in research and development and other strategic initiatives or otherwise adversely affect our business we are subject to us department of defense regulations applicable to certain types of data residing on or transiting through certain information systems and we expect these regulations will be incorporated into certain contracts we hold to the extent that any security breach results in inappropriate disclosure of confidential or controlled information of employees third parties or the us government we may incur liability or the loss of contracts or security clearances as a result in addition we expect to continue devoting additional resources to the security of our information technology systems more resources may be required in the defense arena to the extent the us government increases its cyber security mandates 

we may not have sufficient resources to fund all future research and development and capital expenditures or possible acquisitions 

in order to remain competitive we must make substantial investments in research and development of new or enhanced products and continuously upgrade our process technology and manufacturing capabilities our teledyne scientific company subsidiary which serves as our primary research center has been actively promoting and funding joint research and development projects with other teledyne businesses including our teledyne oil  gas businesses teledyne reynolds inc teledyne brown engineering inc dalsa and lecroy additionally some of our businesses are actively pursuing governmental support and funding for some of their research and development initiatives including dalsa with respect to its cmos and uncooled infrared image sensor development efforts nonetheless we may be unable to fund all of our research and development and capital investment needs or possible acquisitions our ability to raise additional capital will depend on a variety of factors some of which will not be within our control including the existence of bank and capital markets investor perceptions of us our businesses and the industries in which we operate and general economic conditions failure to successfully raise needed capital or generate cash flow on a timely or costeffective basis could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition in addition if we fail to accurately predict future customer needs and preferences or fail to produce viable technologies we may invest heavily in research and development of products that do not lead to significant revenue which would adversely affect our profitability 

limitations in customer funding for applied research and development and technology insertion projects and government support for research and development expenditures may reduce our ability to apply our ongoing investments in some market areas 

we may be unable to successfully introduce new and enhanced products in a timely and costeffective manner or increase our participation in new markets which could harm our profitability and prospects 

our operating results depend in part on our ability to introduce new and enhanced products on a timely basis in order to improve our product development capabilities we purchased the research center that is now teledyne scientific company in 2006 and in 2011 we purchased dalsa which has access to a wellequipped mems research and development center in 2013 we opened a 52000squarefoot technology development center in daytona beach florida primarily to serve the offshore oil and gas production and exploration industries successful product development and introduction depend on numerous factors including our ability to anticipate customer and market requirements changes in technology and industry standards our ability to differentiate our offerings from offerings of our competitors and market acceptance we may not be able to develop and introduce new or enhanced products in a timely and costeffective manner or to develop and introduce products that satisfy customer requirements 

our new products also may not achieve market acceptance or correctly address new industry standards and technological changes we may also lose any technological advantage to competitors if we fail to develop new products in a timely manner 

additionally new products may trigger increased warranty costs as information on such products is augmented by actual usage accelerated entry of new products to meet heightened market demand and competitive pressures may cause additional warranty costs as development and testing time periods might be accelerated or condensed 

we intend to both adapt our existing technologies and develop new products to expand into new market segments we may be unsuccessful in accessing these and other new markets if our products do not meet our customers’ requirements as a result of changes in either technology and industry standards or because of actions taken by our competitors 

technological change and evolving industry and regulatory standards could cause some of our products or services to become obsolete or noncompetitive 

the markets for some of our products and services are characterized by rapid technological development evolving industry standards changes in customer requirements and new product introductions and enhancements a faster than anticipated change in one or more of the technologies related to our products or services or in market demand for products or services based on a particular technology could result in faster than anticipated obsolescence of certain of our products or services and could lead to reduced sales of those products which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition currently accepted industry and regulatory standards are also subject to change which may contribute to the obsolescence of our products or services 

we may not be able to reduce the costs of our products to satisfy customers’ cost reduction mandates which could harm our sales or margins 

more and more customers continue to seek price reductions of our products while we continually work to reduce our manufacturing and other costs of our products without affecting product quality and reliability there is no assurance that we will be able to do so and do so in a timely manner to satisfy the pricing pressures of our customers cost reductions of raw materials and other components used in our products may be beyond our control depending on market conditions customers may seek lower cost products from china and other developing countries where manufacturing costs are lower 

the airline industry is heavily regulated and if we fail to comply with applicable requirements our results of operations could suffer 

governmental agencies throughout the world including the us federal aviation administration or the faa prescribe standards and qualification requirements for aircraft components including virtually all commercial airline and general aviation products specific regulations vary from country to country although compliance with faa requirements generally satisfies regulatory requirements in other countries if any material authorization or approval qualifying us to supply our products is revoked or suspended then the sale of the product would be prohibited by law which would have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

from time to time the faa or equivalent regulatory agencies in other countries propose new regulations or changes to existing regulations which are usually more stringent than existing regulations if these proposed regulations are adopted and enacted we may incur significant additional costs to achieve compliance which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations recent trends by china’s aviation authority to relax restrictions on airspace may be reversed and anticipated new regulations loosening airspace restrictions may not materialize which could impact the future prospects of our commercial aerospace businesses china’s aviation authorities are also proposing new safety regulations for airlines that could result in increased sales of our avionics products in china if these regulations are not adopted or are not adopted in a manner that benefits us the growth prospects of our commercial aerospace business in china may be limited 

  increasing competition could reduce the demand for our products and services 

each of our markets is highly competitive many of our competitors have and potential competitors could have greater name recognition a larger installed base of products more extensive engineering manufacturing marketing and distribution capabilities and greater financial technological and personnel resources than we do new or existing competitors may also develop new technologies that could adversely affect the demand for our products and services industry acquisition and consolidation trends particularly among aerospace and defense contractors have adversely impacted demand for our aerospace and defense related engineering services as large prime contractors insource increased amounts of major acquisition programs and also require significant expansion in small business participation to meet government contracting goals lowcost competition from china and other developing countries could also result in decreased demand for our products increasing competition could reduce the volume of our sales or the prices we may charge which would negatively impact our revenues smaller defense budgets both in the united states and europe could result in additional competition for new and existing defense programs 

product liability claims product recalls and field service actions could have a material adverse effect on our reputation business results of operations and financial condition and we may have difficulty obtaining product liability and other insurance coverage 

as a manufacturer and distributor of a wide variety of products including monitoring instruments products used in offshore oil and gas production products used in commercial aviation and products used in medical devices most recently including xray detectors and generators our results of operations are susceptible to adverse publicity regarding the quality or safety of our products in part product liability claims challenging the safety of our products may result in a decline in sales for a particular product which could adversely affect our results of operations this could be the case even if the claims themselves are proven untrue or settled for immaterial amounts 

while we have general liability and other insurance policies concerning product liabilities we have selfinsured retentions or deductibles under such policies with respect to a portion of these liabilities awarded damages could be more than our accruals we could incur losses above the aggregate annual policy limit as well we cannot assure that for 2016 and in future years insurance carriers will be willing to renew coverage or provide new coverage for product liability 

product recalls can be expensive and tarnish our reputation and have a material adverse effect on the sales of our products we cannot assure that we will not have additional product liability claims or that we will not recall any products 

we have been joined among a number of defendants often over 100 in lawsuits alleging injury or death as a result of exposure to asbestos in addition because of the prominent “teledyne” name we may continue to be mistakenly joined in lawsuits involving a company or business that was not assumed by us as part of our 1999 spinoff to date we have not incurred material liabilities in connection with these lawsuits however our historic insurance coverage including that of its predecessors may not fully cover such claims and the defense of such matters coverage typically depends on the year of purported exposure and other factors nonetheless we intend to vigorously defend our position against these claims 

certain gas generators historically manufactured by teledyne energy systems inc contained a sealed wetted asbestos component while the company has transitioned to a replacement material had placed warning labels on its products and took care in the handling of this discontinued material by employees there is no assurance that the company will not face product liability or workers compensation claims involving this component 

our teledyne brown engineering inc’s laboratory in knoxville tennessee performs radiological analyses our teledyne dalsa professional imaging unit develops image sensors used in medical and dental xray applications along with portable xray generators used in nondestructive testing and security applications in addition our teledyne dalsa digital imaging unit develops equipment and sensors used in eye examination and general surgical vision applications errors and omissions in analyses may occur or erroneous images could be captured our insurance coverage or indemnities may not be adequate to cover potential problems associated with faulty radiological analyses 

teledyne brown engineering inc and other teledyne companies manufacture components for customers in the nuclear power market including utilities and certain governmental entities certain liabilities associated with such products are covered by the priceanderson nuclear industries indemnity act and other statutory and common law defenses and we have received indemnities from some of our customers however there is no assurance we will not face product liability claims related to such products or that our exposure will not exceed the amounts for which we have liability coverage or protection 

our business and financial results could be adversely affected by conditions and other factors associated with our suppliers 

some items we purchase for the manufacture of our products are purchased from limited or single sources of supply due to technical capability price and other factors for example dalsa has a single source of supply for ccd semiconductor wafers used to assemble image sensors and an external single source of supply for cmos semiconductor wafers used to assemble xray panel products lecroy continues to outsource a portion of its research and development activities to a third party engineering firm in malaysia where it may be more difficult for us to enforce our intellectual property rights we have also outsourced from time to time the manufacturing of certain parts components subsystems and even finished products to single or limited sources including international sources disruption of these sources could cause delays or reductions in shipments of our products or increases in our costs which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or operations international sources possess additional risks some of which are similar to those described above in regard to international sales with any continuing disruption in the global economy and financial markets some of our suppliers may also continue to face issues gaining access to sufficient credit and materials to maintain their businesses which could reduce the availability of some components and to the extent such suppliers are single source suppliers could adversely affect our ability to continue to manufacture and sell our products continuing economic pressure on suppliers may also trigger increased pricing or workforce reductions or reduced workweeks and a shrinking supply base possibly creating longer lead times to obtain needed components for our products delays in material acceptance and a greater risk of receiving counterfeit parts 

some of our commercial product lines may have one or a limited number of customers the loss of which could adversely affect our business or financial results 

while no commercial customer accounted for more than 10 of our total sales during 2015  2014  and 2013  and we have hundreds of customers in the various industries that we serve some of our product lines may have one or a few key customers the loss of which could adversely affect our business or financial results teledyne’s largest commercial customer a customer of our instrumentation segment accounted for 23  28  and 36  of total sales in 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively 

newer products such as our xray generators and xray panel products may initially be more heavily dependent on a singular or limited number of customers until market acceptance is obtained or due to contractual terms similarly some older product lines may be more heavily dependent on a singular or limited number of customers in either such case program delays of such customer or customers as well as the loss of such customer or customers could adversely affect our business or financial results 

we face risks related to sales through distributors and other third parties that we do not control which could harm our business 

we sell a portion of our products through third parties such as distributors valueadded resellers and oems collectively “distributors” using third parties for distribution exposes teledyne to many risks including concentration credit risk and compliance risks we may rely on one or more key distributors for a product and the loss of these distributors could reduce our revenue distributors may face financial difficulties including bankruptcy which could harm our collection of accounts receivables and financial results violations of the fcpa or similar antibribery laws by distributors or other third party intermediaries could have a material impact on our business failing to manage risks related to our use of distributors may reduce sales increase expenses and weaken our competitive position and could result in sanctions against us 

compliance with increasing environmental and climate change regulations as well as the effects of potential environmental liabilities could have a material adverse financial effect on us 

we like other industry participants are subject to various federal state local and international environmental laws and regulations we may be subject to increasingly stringent environmental standards in the future particularly as greenhouse gas emissions and climate change regulations and initiatives increase future developments administrative actions or liabilities relating to environmental and climate change matters could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition environmental regulations on hydraulic fracturing and the use of seismic energy sources for offshore energy exploration could adversely affect some product lines of our instrumentation segment 

our manufacturing operations could expose us to material environmental liabilities and companies we acquire may have environmental liabilities that are not accurately assessed or brought to our attention at the time of the acquisition in 2013 we established an environmental reserve related to potential soil remediation activities at a former leased facility which as of january 3 2016 was 46 million 

the us environmental protection agency “epa” has focused on greenhouse gases “ghgs” maintaining ghgs threaten the public health and welfare of the american people the epa also maintains that ghg emissions from onroad vehicles contribute to that threat the epa’s endangerment finding covers emissions of six greenhouse gases the epa’s continuing efforts to limit ghg emissions could adversely affect our us manufacturing operations increase prices for energy fuel and transportation require us to accommodate changes in parameters such as the way parts are manufactured and may in some cases require us to redesign certain of our products this could lead to increased costs which we may not be able to recover from customers delays in product shipments and loss of market share to competitors 

for additional discussion of environmental matters see the discussion under the caption “other matters  environmental” of “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of results of operation and financial condition” and note 14 to our notes to consolidated financial statements 

our inability to attract and retain key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our future success 

our future success depends to a significant extent upon the continued service of our executive officers and other key management and technical personnel and on our ability to continue to attract retain and motivate qualified personnel we also have a maturing work force while we have engaged in succession planning the loss of the services of one or more of our key employees or our failure to attract retain and motivate qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we may not be able to sell exit or reconfigure businesses facilities or product lines that we determine no longer meet with our growth strategy or that should be consolidated 

consistent with our strategy to emphasize growth in our core markets we continually evaluate our businesses to ensure that they are aligned with our strategy this review led to the decision to sell our general aviation piston engine businesses which sale was completed in april 2011 as a result of our review and declines in our electronic manufacturing services businesses in 2013 we closed our teledyne microelectronics technologies’ facility in marina del rey california and relocated several of its product lines to other teledyne locations in further response to downturns in our defense businesses in 2013 we also began consolidating some of our microelectronic component operations into our mountain view california facility and also our shipley england facility and relatedly sold a former manufacturing site in sunnyvale california additionally we closed teledyne cml group limited’s precision machining and fabrications business in birkenhead england to focus more on its advanced composites manufacturing business 

in 2015 we began to consolidate some of the businesses units and facilities in our instrumentation segment which is expected to continue in 2016 we may not be able to realize efficiencies and cost savings from these consolidation activities there is no assurance that our efforts will be successful if we do not successfully manage our current consolidation activities or any other similar activities that we may undertake in the future expected efficiencies and benefits might be delayed or not realized and our operations and business could be disrupted our ability to dispose of exit or reconfigure businesses that may no longer be aligned with our growth strategy will depend on many factors including the terms and conditions of any asset purchase and sale agreement as well as industry business and economic conditions we cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to sell nonstrategic businesses on terms that are acceptable to us or at all in addition if the sale of any nonstrategic business cannot be consummated or is not practical alternative courses of action including relocation of product lines or closure may not be available to us or may be more costly than anticipated 

natural and manmade disasters could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

several of our facilities as a result of their locations could be subject to a catastrophic loss caused by earthquakes hurricanes tornados floods ice storms or other natural disasters many of our production facilities and our headquarters are located in california and thus are in areas with above average seismic activity and may also be at risk of damage in wildfires teledyne dalsa’s semiconductor facilities in quebec canada have been impacted by severe ice storms including a storm in 2013 in addition we have manufacturing facilities in the southeastern united states and texas that have been threatened and struck by major hurricanes in october 2012 lecroy and other teledyne facilities incurred business interruptions and were without power for several days as a result of hurricane sandy our facilities in alabama florida nebraska tennessee and virginia have also been threatened by tornados in june 2012 a tornado caused substantial damage to and interrupted business at our teledyne hastings instruments facility in hampton virginia in april 2011 tornados caused substantial damage in huntsville alabama while teledyne brown engineering’s main facility in huntsville alabama incurred minimal building damage and business interruption the facility was without power for several days if any of our california facilities including our california headquarters were to experience a catastrophic earthquake or wildfire loss or if any of our alabama florida louisiana nebraska tennessee or texas facilities were to experience a catastrophic hurricane storm tornado or other natural disaster or if dalsa’s facilities in quebec experience longterm loss of electrical power such event could disrupt our operations delay production shipments and revenue and result in large expenses to repair or replace the facility or facilities while teledyne has property insurance to partially reimburse it for losses caused by windstorm and earth movement such insurance would not cover all possible losses in addition our existing disaster recovery and business continuity plans including those relating to our information technology systems may not be fully responsive to or minimize losses associated with catastrophic events 

the environmental disaster triggered by the deepwater horizon rig explosion and oil spill in 2010 resulted in a moratorium on offshore oil and gas production in the gulf of mexico that adversely affected the results of operations of some of our teledyne oil and gas businesses although such adverse impact was offset in part by the products we manufacture that supported wellcapping and environmental cleanup efforts environmental regulations enacted in the wake of this oil spill have resulted in increased compliance costs to some of our teledyne oil and gas businesses similar future manmade disasters that limit or cease offshore oil and gas production or further exploration in the regions in which we sell our products could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

disasters that do not directly impact us can have an indirect adverse impact on our business for example in 2011 the earthquake in northern japan and the related tsunami and severe flooding in thailand resulted in certain of our customers delaying orders for our products because they were unable to obtain critical supplies from vendors in the impacted areas 

teledyne brown engineering inc is building an imaging platform to be affixed to the iss for the program to be financially successful the 17 yearold iss must continue to fly in a safe and human tended condition while certain spaceflight risks such as a highvelocity debris impact to the station causing significant structural damage or necessitating the evacuation of the iss have been regarded as small if such event were to occur the iss program continuation could be threatened jeopardizing our investment and potential revenue generation from issbased earth imaging 

we may not be able to enforce or protect our intellectual property rights or third parties may claim infringement of their intellectual rights each which may harm our ability to compete and thus harm our business 

our ability to enforce and protect our patents copyrights software licenses trade secrets knowhow and other intellectual property rights is subject to general litigation risks as well as uncertainty as to the enforceability of our intellectual property rights in various countries when we seek to enforce our rights we have found that various claims may be asserted against us including claims that our intellectual property right is invalid is otherwise not enforceable or is licensed to the party against whom we are asserting a claim in addition we may be the target of aggressive and opportunistic enforcement of patents by third parties if we are not ultimately successful in defending ourselves against these claims in litigation we may not be able to sell a particular product or family of products due to an injunction or we may have to pay damages that could in turn harm our results of operations our inability to enforce our intellectual property rights under these circumstances may harm our competitive position and our business 

increases in our effective tax rate may harm our results of operations and cash flow 

our effective tax rate for 2015  was 243 compared with 236  for 2014  and 177  for 2013  while there continues to be congressional discussion about lowering the corporate tax rate in the us to improve global competitiveness a number of factors may impact our effective tax rates which could reduce our net income and increase our tax payments including 

 our inability to efficiently implement changes to our enterprise resource planning software could result in higher than expected costs or otherwise adversely impact our internal controls environment operations and profitability 

we are implementing enterprise resource planning software systems which are intended to improve our business processes in certain business units the costs associated with such systems can be significant and we could incur costs in excess of budgeted costs any technical or other difficulties in developing or implementing this initiative may increase the costs of the project and have an adverse effect on our operations and reporting processes including our internal controls over financial reporting as we make adjustments to operations as a result of this project we may incur incremental expenses prior to realizing the benefits of a more efficient workforce and operating structure although implementation has occurred in only selected business units to date and efforts have been made to minimize adverse impacts on our controls we cannot assure that all such impacts have been mitigated further we may not realize anticipated cost improvements and greater efficiencies from the project 

our financial statements are based on estimates required by generally accepted accounting principles in the united states “gaap” and actual results may differ materially from those estimated under different assumptions or conditions 

our financial statements are prepared in conformity with gaap these principles require our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period for example estimates are used when accounting for items such as asset valuations allowances for doubtful accounts allowance for excess and obsolete inventory depreciation and amortization impairment assessments employee benefits taxes recall and warranty costs product and general liability and contingencies while we base our estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances at the time made actual results may differ materially from those estimated our most critical accounting estimates are described in the management discussion in this form 10k under “critical accounting estimates” 

while we believe our internal control systems are effective there are inherent limitations in all control systems and misstatements resulting from error or fraud may occur and may not be detected 

we continue to take action to assure compliance with the internal controls disclosure controls and other requirements of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer cannot guarantee that our internal controls and disclosure controls will prevent all possible errors or all fraud a control system no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met in addition the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefit of controls must be relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no system of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within the company have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake further controls can be circumvented by individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more persons or by management override of the controls the design of any system of controls is also based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions over time a control may be inadequate because of changes in conditions or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate because of inherent limitations in a costeffective control system misstatements resulting from error or fraud may occur and may not be detected 

provisions of our governing documents applicable law and our change in control severance agreements could make an acquisition of teledyne more difficult 

our restated certificate of incorporation our amended and restated bylaws and the general corporation law of the state of delaware contain several provisions that could make the acquisition of control of teledyne in a transaction not approved by our board of directors more difficult we have also entered into change in control severance agreements with thirteen members of our current management which could have an antitakeover effect these provisions may prevent or discourage attempts to acquire our company 

the market price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly since we became a public company and could continue to do so 

since we became an independent public company on november 29 1999 the market price of our common stock has fluctuated substantially and fluctuations in our stock price could continue in fiscal 2015 our stock price declined 15 among the factors that could affect our stock price are 

 the stock markets in general and the markets for hightechnology companies in particular have experienced a high degree of volatility that is not necessarily related to the operating performance of these companies we cannot provide assurances as to our stock price we have in the past repurchased shares of our stock pursuant to boardapproved stock repurchase programs we cannot provide assurances that we will continue to repurchase shares under those programs or that our board will authorize new repurchase programs

decrease of 14 operating income was 314 million in 2014 compared with 220 million in 2013 an increase of 427 

the 2014 sales decrease of 40 million reflected lower sales of 61 million from engineered products and services 

partially offset by higher sales of energy systems products of 16 million and higher turbine engines sales of 05 million 

the sales decrease from engineered products and services primarily reflected lower sales from missile defense and nuclear 

programs the increase in operating income in 2014 reflected the impact of pension income compared with pension expense 

in 2013 lower severance and facility consolidation expenses partially offset by the impact of lower sales pension income 

was 16 million for 2014 compared with pension expense of 67 million for 2013 pension expense allocated to contracts 

pursuant to cas was 88 million for 2014 compared with 85 million for 2013

financial condition liquidity and capital resources 

principal capital requirements 

our principal cash and capital requirements are to fund working capital needs capital expenditures income tax payments pension contributions and debt service requirements as well as acquisitions the company may also deploy cash for the stock repurchase program it is anticipated that operating cash flow together with available borrowings under the credit facility described below will be sufficient to meet these requirements and could be used to fund acquisitions in 2016 to support acquisitions we may need to raise additional capital our liquidity is not dependent upon the use of offbalance sheet financial arrangements we have no offbalance sheet financing arrangements that incorporate the use of special purpose or unconsolidated entities 

credit facility senior notes and term loans 

in november 2015 the company issued 1250 million in aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes the notes consisted of 250 million of 281 senior unsecured notes due in november 2020 and 1000 million of 328 senior unsecured notes due in november 2022 also in december 2015 the company amended the 7500 million credit facility to extend the maturity from march 2018 to december 2020 excluding interest and fees no payments are due under the credit facility until it matures borrowings under our credit facility and term loans are at variable rates which are at our option tied to a eurocurrency rate equal to libor london interbank offered rate plus an applicable rate or a base rate as defined in our credit agreements eurocurrency rate loans may be denominated in us dollars or an alternative currency as defined in the agreement eurocurrency or libor based loans under the facility typically have terms of one two three or six months and the interest rate for each such loan is subject to change if the loan is continued or converted following the applicable maturity date the company has not drawn any loans with a term longer than three months under the credit facility base rate loans have interest rates that primarily fluctuate with changes in the prime rate interest rates are also subject to change based on our consolidated leverage ratio as defined in the credit agreement the credit facility also provides for facility fees that vary between 012 and 025 of the credit line depending on our consolidated leverage ratio as calculated from time to time 



the company also has 86 million  in capital leases of which 12 million  is current at january 3 2016  teledyne had 128 million  in outstanding letters of credit 

our credit facility senior notes and term loans agreements require the company to comply with various financial and operating covenants including maintaining certain consolidated leverage and interest coverage ratios as well as minimum net worth levels and limits on acquired debt at january 3 2016  the company was in compliance with these covenants and we had a significant amount of margin between required financial covenant ratios and our actual ratios currently we do not believe our ability to undertake additional debt financing if needed is reasonably likely to be materially impacted by debt restrictions under our credit agreements subject to our complying with required financial covenants listed in the table below 

financial covenant ratios and the actual ratios at january 3 2016    



 available borrowing capacity under the 7500 million credit facility which is reduced by borrowings and outstanding letters of credit was 5882 million  at january 3 2016  teledyne also has a 50 million uncommitted credit line which permits credit extensions up to 50 million plus an incremental 20 million solely for standby letters of credit this credit line is utilized as needed for periodic cash needs no amounts were outstanding under this facility at january 3 2016  or december 28 2014 

permanently reinvested earnings 

we intend to indefinitely reinvest the earnings of our material foreign subsidiaries in our operations outside of the united states the cash that the companys foreign subsidiaries hold for indefinite reinvestment is generally used to finance foreign operations and investments including acquisitions we estimate that future domestic cash generation will be sufficient to meet future domestic cash requirements at january 3 2016  the amount of undistributed foreign earnings was 1933 million of which we have not recorded a deferred tax liability of approximately 497 million should we decide to repatriate the foreign earnings we would need to adjust our income tax provision in the period we determined that the earnings will no longer be indefinitely invested outside the united states 

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our expected cash outflows resulting from financial contracts and commitments at january 3 2016  we have not included information on our normal recurring purchases of materials for use in our operations these amounts are generally consistent from year to year closely reflect our levels of production and are not longterm in nature 



  

 

unrecognized tax benefits of 288 million are not included in the table above because 93 million is offset by deferred tax assets and the remainder cannot be reasonably estimated to be settled in cash due to a lack of prior settlement history 

at january 3 2016  we were not required and accordingly are not planning to make any cash contributions to the domestic qualified pension plan for 2016 our minimum funding requirements after 2016 as set forth by erisa are dependent on several factors as discussed under “accounting for pension plans” in the critical accounting policies section of this management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation estimates beyond 2016 have not been provided due to the significant uncertainty of these amounts which are subject to change until the company’s pension assumptions can be updated at the appropriate times in addition certain pension contributions are eligible for future recovery through the pricing of products and services to the us government under certain government contracts therefore the amounts noted are not necessarily indicative of the impact these contributions may have on our liquidity we also have payments due under our other postretirement benefit plans these plans are not required to be funded in advance but are pay as you go see further discussion in note 11 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements teledyne intends to continue to monitor and manage its defined benefit pension plans obligation and may take additional actions to manage risk in the future 

operating activities 

in 2015  net cash provided by operating activities was 2102 million  compared with 2879 million  in 2014  and 2033 million  in 2013  the lower cash provided by operating activities in 2015 compared with 2014 reflected lower net income lower customer deposits and advanced payments and higher income tax payments the 2015 amounts reflected the receipt of 30 million related to a legal settlement while the 2014 amount reflected the receipt of 100 million related to a legal settlement the higher cash provided by operating activities in 2014 compared with 2013 reflected higher net income the absence of pension contributions in 2014 while in 2013 we made a voluntary 830 million pretax cash contribution to the domestic pension plan partially offset by higher income tax payments 

free cash flow cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures was 1632 million  in 2015  compared with 2444 million  in 2014  and 1307 million  in 2013  adjusted free cash flow eliminates the impact of pension contributions on a net of tax basis and was 1632 million  in 2015 compared with 2444 million  in 2014  and 1821 million  in 2013  



  

 

working capital 

working capital increased to 4346 million  at yearend 2015  compared with 4027 million  at yearend 2014  the increase reflected the repayment of 750 million in senior notes classified as short term partially offset by lower foreign cash balances due to the use of cash for recent acquisitions the senior notes were repaid with funds drawn under the credit facility which is classified as longterm 



the decrease in cash primarily reflects the use of cash by foreign subsidiaries to fund the icm bowtech and optech acquisitions the decrease in the current portion of longterm debt primarily reflects the repayment of 750 million in senior notes the increase in longterm debt and in treasury stock reflects the impact of the stock repurchase program the increase in accumulated other comprehensive loss primarily reflects the impact of foreign currency adjustments 

investing activities 

cash flows relating to investing activities consists primarily of cash used for acquisitions and capital expenditures net cash used in investing activities was 1099 million 2387 million and 1950 million for 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively 



the decrease in spending in 2014 compared with 2013 reflected the completion of several major projects during 2013 including expanding production capabilities and a resource planning software system the 2013 amount also reflected expenditures related to facility consolidations during 2016 we plan to invest approximately 600 million  in capital expenditures principally to upgrade capital equipment reduce manufacturing costs and introduce new products commitments at january 3 2016  for capital expenditures were approximately 80 million  

acquisitions 

investing activities used cash for acquisitions and investments of 667 million  1958 million  and 1282 million  in fiscal 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively see “recent acquisitions” 

teledyne funded the acquisitions primarily from borrowings under its credit facility and cash on hand 

for all acquisitions the results of operations and cash flows are included in our consolidated financial statements from the date of each respective acquisition the icm and axiom acquisitions are part of the digital imaging segment all other acquisitions in 2015 2014 and 2013 are part of the instrumentation segment 

the following table shows the purchase price net of cash acquired goodwill acquired and intangible assets acquired for the acquisitions and other investments made in fiscal 2015  and 2014  in millions 



  

  except for the atlas and oceanscience acquisitions goodwill resulting from the acquisitions made in fiscal 2015  and 2014  will not be deductible for tax purposes 



financing activities 

financing activities for 2015  reflected net payments on longterm debt of 476 million compared with net proceeds from longterm debt of 295 million  for 2014 and net payments on longterm debt of 50 million  for 2013 in addition in both 2015 and 2014 the company issued 1250 million  of senior unsecured notes 

fiscal years 2015  2014  and 2013  reflect proceeds from the exercise of stock options of 190 million  183 million  and 121 million  respectively fiscal years 2015  2014  and 2013  included 43 million  62 million  and 54 million  respectively in excess tax benefits related to stockbased compensation financing activities for 2015 and 2014 also reflected the repurchase of common stock for 2438 million and 1466 million respectively share repurchases totaled 2561815 shares in 2015 and 1396290 shares in 2014 see note 8 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information about our stock repurchase program 

other matters 

pension plans 

teledyne has a domestic defined benefit pension plan covering substantially all us employees hired before january 1 2004 or approximately 18  of teledyne’s active employees as of january 1 2004 new hires participate in a defined contribution plan in 2015 and 2014 teledyne’s domestic pension plan was over 100 funded thus no cash contributions were made for the company’s domestic pension plan the discount rate for 2016 will increase to 49 from 45 in 2015 in 2013 teledyne made a voluntary pretax contribution to its domestic qualified pension plan of 830 million before recovery from the us government the company also has several foreignbased defined benefit pension plans 

income taxes 

our income tax expense deferred tax assets and liabilities and reserves for unrecognized tax benefits reflect management’s best assessment of estimated current and future taxes to be paid we are subject to income taxes in both the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions significant judgments and estimates are required in determining the consolidated income tax expense 

deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amount in the financial statements which will result in taxable or deductible amounts in the future in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets within the jurisdiction from which they arise we consider all available positive and negative evidence including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities projected future taxable income taxplanning strategies and results of recent operations in projecting future taxable income we begin with historical results adjusted for the results of discontinued operations and incorporate assumptions about the amount of future state federal and foreign pretax operating income adjusted for items that do not have tax consequences the assumptions about future taxable income require significant judgment and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses in evaluating the objective evidence that historical results provide we consider three years of cumulative operating income based on the company’s history of operating earnings expectations of future operating earnings and potential tax planning strategies management believes that it is possible that some portion of deferred taxes will not be realized as a future tax benefit and therefore has recorded a valuation allowance 

we file income tax returns in the united states federal jurisdiction and in various states and foreign jurisdictions the company has substantially concluded on all us federal income tax matters for all years through 2011 california income tax matters for all years through 2010 and canadian income tax matters for all years through 2007 

costs and pricing 

inflationary trends in recent years have been moderate current inventory costs the increasing costs of equipment and other costs are considered in establishing sales pricing policies the company emphasizes cost containment in all aspects of its business 

hedging activities market risk disclosures 

teledyne transacts business in various foreign currencies and has international sales and expenses denominated in foreign currencies subjecting the company to foreign currency risk the company’s primary objective is to protect the united states dollar value of future cash flows and minimize the volatility of reported earnings the company utilizes foreign currency forward contracts to reduce the volatility of cash flows primarily related to forecasted revenue and expenses denominated in canadian dollars for our canadian companies including dalsa these contracts are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges 

the effectiveness of the cash flow hedge contracts excluding time value is assessed prospectively and retrospectively on a monthly basis using regression analysis as well as using other timing and probability criteria to receive hedge accounting treatment all hedging relationships are formally documented at the inception of the hedges and must be highly effective in offsetting changes to future cash flows on hedged transactions the effective portion of the cash flow hedge contracts’ gains or losses resulting from changes in the fair value of these hedges is initially reported net of tax as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income  “ aoci ”  in stockholders’ equity until the underlying hedged item is reflected in our consolidated statements of income at which time the effective amount in accumulated other comprehensive income is reclassified to cost of sales in our consolidated statements of income the company expects to reclassify a loss of approximately 40 million net of tax over the next 12 months based on the yearend 2015 exchange rate 

in the event that the gains or losses in aoci are deemed to be ineffective the ineffective portion of gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value if any is reclassified to other income and expense in the event that the underlying forecasted transactions do not occur or it becomes remote that they will occur within the defined hedge period the gains or losses on the related cash flow hedges will be reclassified from aoci to other income and expense during the current 

reporting period all forecasted transactions occurred and therefore there were no such gains or losses reclassified to other income and expense as of january 3 2016  teledyne had foreign currency forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges to buy canadian dollars and to sell us dollars totaling 794 million  and these contracts had a negative fair value of 59 million  these foreign currency forward contracts have maturities ranging from march 2016 to february 2018 

in addition the company utilizes foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate foreign exchange rate risk associated with foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities including intercompany receivables and payables as of january 3 2016  teledyne had foreign currency contracts of this type in the following currency pairs in millions 



these contracts had a negative fair value of 57 million  at january 3 2016  the gains and losses on these derivatives which are not designated as hedging instruments under asc 815 derivatives and hedging are intended to at a minimum partially offset the transaction gains and losses recognized in earnings all derivatives are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value as discussed below the accounting for gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value depends on the use of the derivative and whether it is designated and qualifies for hedge accounting teledyne does not use foreign currency forward contracts for speculative or trading purposes 

notwithstanding our efforts to mitigate portions of our foreign currency exchange rate risks there can be no assurance that our hedging activities will adequately protect us against the risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations a hypothetical 10 appreciation of the us dollar from its value at january 3 2016  would decrease the fair value of our foreign currency forward contracts associated with our cash flow hedging activities by 79 million  a hypothetical 10 depreciation of the us dollar from its value at january 3 2016  would increase the fair value of our foreign currency forward contracts associated with our cash flow hedging activities by 79 million  

borrowings under our credit facility are at fixed rates that vary with the term and timing of each loan under the facility loans under the facility typically have terms of one two three or six months and the interest rate for each such loan is subject to change if the loan is continued or converted following the applicable maturity date interest rates are also subject to change based on our debt to earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization ratio as of january 3 2016  we had 1505 million  outstanding indebtedness under our 7500 million credit facility any borrowings under the company’s revolving credit line are based on a fluctuating market interest rate and consequently the fair value of any outstanding debt should not be affected materially by changes in market interest rates a 100 basis point increase in interest rates would result in an increase in annual interest expense of approximately 15 million  assuming the 1505 million  in debt was outstanding for the full year 

we believe that adequate controls are in place to monitor any hedging activities our primary exposure to market risk relates to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates we periodically evaluate these risks and have taken measures to mitigate these risks we own assets and operate facilities in countries that have been politically stable 

environmental 

we are subject to various federal state local and international environmental laws and regulations which require that we investigate and remediate the effects of the release or disposal of materials at sites associated with past and present operations these include sites at which teledyne has been identified as a potentially responsible party under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act commonly known as superfund and comparable state laws we are currently involved in the investigation and remediation of a number of sites reserves for environmental investigation and remediation totaled 87 million  at january 3 2016  and 97 million  at december 28 2014  as investigation and remediation of these sites proceed and new information is received the company expects that accruals will be adjusted to reflect new information based on current information we do not believe that future environmental costs in excess of those already accrued will materially and adversely affect our financial condition or liquidity see also our environmental risk factor disclosure beginning on page 23 and notes 2 and 14 to our notes to consolidated financial statements 

government contracts 

we perform work on a number of contracts with the us department of defense and other agencies and departments of the us government including subcontracts with government prime contractors sales under these contracts with the us government which included contracts with the us department of defense were approximately 26  of total sales in 2015  25  of total sales in 2014  and 27  of total sales in 2013  for a summary of sales to the us government by segment see note 12 to our notes to consolidated financial statements sales to the us department of defense represented approximately 19  20  and 21  of total sales for 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively see also our government contracts risks factor disclosure beginning on page 17 

performance under government contracts has certain inherent risks that could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business results of operations and financial condition government contracts are conditioned upon the continuing availability of congressional appropriations which usually occurs on a fiscal year basis even though contract performance may take more than one year 

for information on accounts receivable from the us government see note 5 to our notes to consolidated financial statements 

estimates and reserves 

our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent liabilities on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including those related to product returns and replacements allowance for doubtful accounts inventories intangible assets income taxes warranty obligations pension and other postretirement benefits longterm contracts environmental workers’ compensation and general liability employee dental and medical benefits and other contingencies and litigation we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances at the time the results of which form the basis for making our judgments actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions in some cases such differences may be material see also critical accounting policies 

the following table reflects significant reserves and valuation accounts which are estimates and based on judgments as described above at january 3 2016  and december 28 2014  in millions 



  

a this table should be read in conjunction with the notes to consolidated financial statements 

b includes both longterm and shortterm reserves 

some of the company’s products are subject to specified warranties and the company provides for the estimated cost of product warranties we regularly assess the adequacy of our preexisting warranty liabilities and adjust amounts as necessary based on a review of historic warranty experience with respect to the applicable business or products as well as the length and actual terms of the warranties which are typically one year the product warranty reserve is included in current accrued liabilities and other longterm liabilities on the balance sheet 



critical accounting policies 

the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with united states generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the notes to the financial statements some of those judgments can be subjective and complex and therefore actual results could differ materially from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions our critical accounting policies are those that are reflective of significant judgment complexity and uncertainty and may potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions we have identified the following as critical accounting policies revenue recognition accounting for pension plans accounting for business combinations goodwill and other longlived assets and accounting for income taxes for additional discussion of the application of these and other accounting policies see note 2 of our notes to consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition 

revenue is recognized when the earnings process is substantially complete and all of the following criteria are met 1 persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists 2 delivery has occurred or services have been rendered 3 our price to our customer is fixed or determinable and 4 collectability is reasonably assured 

we determine the appropriate method by which we recognize revenue by analyzing the terms and conditions of our contracts or arrangements entered into with our customers the majority of our revenue relates to product sales and is recognized upon shipment to the customer at fixed or determinable prices and with a reasonable assurance of collection passage of title to the customer and fulfillment of all significant obligations revenue is recognized net of estimated sales returns and other allowances the company does not offer substantial sales incentives and credits to customers the remaining revenue is generally associated with longterm contracts to design develop and manufacture highly engineered products used in commercial or defense applications such contracts are generally accounted for using contract accounting percentageofcompletion “poc” method 

the company’s standard terms of sale are fob shipping point for a small percentage of sales where title and risk of loss passes at destination point and assuming all other criteria for revenue recognition are met the company recognizes revenue after delivery to the customer if any significant obligation to the customer with respect to a sales transaction remains following shipment revenue recognition is deferred until such obligations have been fulfilled in general our revenue arrangements do not involve acceptance provisions based on customer specified acceptance criteria in those circumstances when customer specified acceptance criteria exist and if we cannot demonstrate that the system meets those specifications prior to the shipment then revenue is deferred until customer acceptance is obtained 

we have a few contracts that require the company to warehouse certain goods for which revenue is recognized when all risks of loss is borne by the customer and all other criteria for revenue recognition are met 

we also have a small number of multiple elements arrangements ie free product training installation additional parts etc if contract accounting does not apply we allocate the contract price among the deliverables based on vendorspecific objective evidence of fair value to each element in the arrangement if objective and reliable evidence of fair value of any element is not available we use our best estimate of selling price for purposes of allocating the total arrangement consideration among the elements also extended or noncustomary warranties do not represent a significant portion of our revenue however when our revenue arrangements include an extended or noncustomary warranty provision the revenue is deferred and recognized ratably over the extended warranty period 

for contracts that require substantial performance over a long time period generally one or more years revenue is recorded under the poc method we record net revenue and an estimated profit as work on our contracts progresses the poc method for these contracts is dependent on the nature of the contract or products provided depending on the contract we may measure the extent of progress toward completion using the unitsofdelivery method costtocost method or upon attainment of scheduled performance contract milestones which could be time event or expense driven for example for costreimbursable contracts we use the costtocost method to measure progress toward completion under the costtocost method of accounting we recognize revenue and an estimated profit as allowable costs are incurred based on the proportion that the incurred costs bear to total estimated costs another example for contracts that require us to provide a substantial number of similar items we record revenue and an estimated profit on a poc basis using unitsofdelivery as the basis to measure progress toward completing the contract occasionally it is appropriate to combine individual customer orders and treat them as one arrangement when the underlying agreement was reached with the customer for a single large project 

 the percentage of company revenue recognized using the poc method was 312  in 2015  287  in 2014  and 321  in 2013  

accounting for contracts using the poc method requires management judgment relative to assessing risks estimating contract revenue and cost and making assumptions for schedule and technical issues contract revenue may include estimated amounts not contractually agreed to by the customer including price redetermination cost or performance incentives such as award and incentives fees unpriced change orders claims and requests for equitable adjustment the poc method requires management’s judgment to make reasonably dependable cost estimates generally over a long time period since certain contracts extend over a long period of time the impact of revisions in cost and revenue estimates during the progress of work may adjust the current period earnings on a cumulative catchup basis this method recognizes in the current period the cumulative effect of the changes on current and prior quarters additionally if the current contract estimate indicates a loss a provision is made for the total anticipated loss in the period that it becomes evident contract cost and revenue estimates for significant contracts are generally reviewed and reassessed at least quarterly 

the net effect of the favorable and unfavorable changes in estimates were expense of 31 million  in 2015  30 million  in 2014  and 18 million  in 2013  the gross aggregate effects of these favorable and unfavorable changes in estimates in 2015  2014  and 2013  were 386 million  229 million  and 214 million  of favorable operating income and 355 million  259 million  and 232 million  of unfavorable operating income respectively we do not believe that any discrete event or adjustment to an individual contract within the aggregate changes in contract estimates for 2015  2014  or 2013  was material to the consolidated statements of income for such annual periods 

pension plans 

teledyne has a defined benefit pension plan covering substantially all us employees hired before january 1 2004 or approximately 18  of teledyne’s active employees as of january 1 2004 new hires participate in a defined contribution plan only the company also has several smaller foreignbased defined benefit pension plans at january 3 2016 the benefit obligation for the domestic defined benefit pension plan totaled 8204 million and the fair value of the net qualified plan assets totaled 8904 million at january 3 2016 the benefit obligation for the foreignbased pension plans totaled 566 million and the fair value of the net plan assets totaled 438 million the company’s accounting for its defined benefit pension plan requires that amounts recognized in financial statements be determined on an actuarial basis rather than as contributions are made to the plan in consultation with our actuaries we determine the appropriate assumptions for use in determining the liability for future pension benefits net actuarial gains or losses are amortized to expense on a planbyplan basis when they exceed the accounting corridor the accounting corridor is a defined range within which amortization of net gains and losses is not required and is equal to 10 percent of the greater of the market related value of assets or benefit obligations gains or losses outside of the corridor are subject to amortization over our average employee future service period of approximately nine years significant assumptions used in determining the company’s pension income or expense is the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets participant mortality estimates expected rates of increase in future compensation levels employee turnover as well as the assumed discount rate on pension obligations the company has assumed based upon the types of securities the plan assets are invested in and the longterm historical returns of these investments that the longterm expected return on pension assets will be 80  in 2016 for its domestic qualified pension plan and the assumed discount rate will be 491  in 2016 for its domestic pension plan the company’s longterm expected return on pension assets used in 2015  was 825 for its domestic qualified pension plans and the assumed discount rate used in 2015  was 45  the actual rate of return on pension assets was a negative return of 11   in 2015  and 54 in 2014  for its domestic qualified pension plan if the actual rate of return on pension assets is below the expected rate of return the company may be required to make additional contributions to the pension trust at january 3 2016 the domestic plan is overfunded and contributions are not required the company did not make any cash contributions to its domestic pension benefit plan in 2015  or in 2014 and made a voluntary pretax cash contribution of 830 million  in 2013 before recovery from the us government in 2014 the society of actuaries released revised mortality tables which updated life expectancy assumptions in consideration of these tables we modified the mortality assumptions used in determining our pension obligations the impact of these new mortality assumptions has resulted in an increase to our pension obligation and an increase in future pension expense our plan remains overfunded after the impact of the new mortality assumptions as well as from changes to other relevant assumptions at yearend 2015  the company has a 2323 million  noncash reduction to stockholders’ equity and a longterm additional liability of 3704 million  related to its pension plans at yearend 2014  the company had a 2293 million  noncash reduction to stockholders’ equity and a longterm additional liability of 3654 million  related to its pension plans 

differences in the discount rate and expected longterm rate of return on assets within the indicated range would have had the following impact on 2015  pension expense in millions

business combinations goodwill and acquired intangible assets 

the results for all acquisitions are included in the company’s consolidated financial statements from the date of each respective acquisition business acquisitions are accounted for under the acquisition method by assigning the purchase price to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at their fair values and the excess of the purchase price over the amounts assigned is recorded as goodwill we determine the fair value of such assets and liabilities generally in consultation with thirdparty valuation advisors acquired intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives adjustments to fair value assessments are recorded to goodwill over the purchase price allocation period 

goodwill and acquired intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized we review goodwill and acquired indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable the company also performs an annual impairment test in the fourth quarter of each year we would test goodwill and acquired indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment between annual tests if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce our enterprise fair value below its book value these events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate including a significant sustained decline in an entity’s market value legal factors operating performance indicators competition sale or disposition of a significant portion of the business or other factors based on an annual impairment test completed in 2015  the company recorded a 05 million impairment to acquired intangible assets based on a quarterly impairment test completed in 2014 the company recorded a 07 million impairment to acquired intangible assets no impairment of goodwill was indicated in 2015 or 2014 based on the annual impairment test completed in the fourth quarter of each year 

for goodwill impairment testing the company estimates the fair value of the reporting units using a discounted cash flow model based on our best estimate of amounts and timing of future revenues and cash flows and our most recent business and strategic plans and compares the estimated fair value to the carrying value of the reporting unit including goodwill the discounted cash flow model requires judgmental assumptions about projected revenue growth future operating margins discount rates and terminal values over a multiyear period there are inherent uncertainties related to these assumptions and managements judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill impairment while the company believes it has made reasonable estimates and assumptions to calculate the fair value of its reporting units it is possible a material change could occur if actual results are not consistent with management’s estimates and assumptions goodwill may be overstated and a charge would need to be taken against net earnings 

as of january 3 2016  the company had 26 reporting units for goodwill impairment testing the carrying value of goodwill included in the company’s individual reporting units ranges from 07 million to 1897 million the company’s analysis in 2015 indicated that in all instances the fair value of the company’s reporting units exceeded their carrying values and consequently did not result in an impairment charge the excess of the estimated fair value over the carrying value expressed as a percentage of carrying value of the respective reporting unit for each of the company’s reporting units as of the fourth quarter of 2015 the annual testing date ranged from approximately 65 to 7199 

changes in these projections could affect the estimated fair value of certain of the company’s reporting units and could result in a goodwill impairment charge in a future period in order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations used in the goodwill impairment test the company applied a hypothetical 10 decrease to the fair values of each reporting unit and compared those values to the reporting unit carrying values based on this sensitivity analysis the company did not identify any goodwill impairment due to the many variables inherent in the estimation of a reporting unit’s fair value and the relative size of our recorded goodwill differences in assumptions may have a material effect on the results of our impairment analysis 

the impairment test for indefinitelived intangibles other than goodwill primarily trademarks and trade names consists of a comparison of the fair value of the indefinitelived intangible asset to the carrying value of the asset as of the impairment testing date the company estimates the fair value of its indefinitelived intangibles using a discounted cash flow model based on our best estimate of amounts and timing of future revenues from our most recent business and strategic plans and compares the estimated fair value to the carrying value of the asset with the exception of the indefinitelived intangible assets from a single business unit the estimated fair values exceed the carrying value for each of the company’s indefinitelived intangible 

assets as of the fourth quarter of 2015  the annual testing date an impairment was recognized for the indefinitelived intangible assets of a single business unit for 05 million an amount for which its carrying value exceeded its estimated fair value 

income taxes 

income tax expense and deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect management’s assessment of actual future taxes to be paid on items reflected in the financial statements significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes uncertainty exists regarding tax positions taken in previously filed tax returns still under examination and positions expected to be taken in the current year and future returns deferred tax assets and liabilities arise due to differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and tax carryforwards although we believe our income tax expense and deferred tax assets and liabilities are reasonable no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome will not be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals to the extent that the final tax outcome is different than the amounts recorded such differences will impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made the provision for income taxes includes the impact of uncertain tax benefits that are considered appropriate as well as the related net interest 

significant judgment is required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets in assessing the need for a valuation allowance we consider all available evidence including past operating results estimates of future taxable income and the feasibility of tax planning strategies in the event that we change our determination as to the amount of deferred tax assets that can be realized we will adjust our valuation allowance with a corresponding impact to the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made 

we record uncertain tax benefits on the basis of a twostep process whereby 1 we determine whether it is more likely than not that the tax positions will be sustained on the basis of the technical merits of the positions and 2 for those tax positions that meet the “morelikelythannot” recognition threshold we recognize the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50 percent likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement with the related tax authority 

an increase of 1 in our nominal tax rate would have resulted in additional income tax provision for the fiscal year ended january 3 2016 of 26 million for a description of the company’s tax accounting policies refer to note 2 and note 10 of our notes to the consolidated financial statements

safe harbor cautionary statement regarding forwardlooking information 

this management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation contains forwardlooking statements as defined in the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 directly and indirectly relating to earnings growth opportunities product sales capital expenditures pension matters stock option compensation expense the credit facility interest expense severance and relocation costs environmental remediation cost stock repurchases taxes exchange rates and strategic plans all statements made in this management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation that are not historical in nature should be considered forwardlooking actual results could differ materially from these forwardlooking statements 

many factors could change the anticipated results including disruptions in the global economy changes in demand for products sold to the defense electronics instrumentation digital imaging energy exploration and production commercial aviation semiconductor and communications markets funding continuation and award of government programs and cuts to defense spending resulting from existing and future deficit reduction measures threats to the security of our confidential and proprietary information including cyber security threats lower oil and natural gas prices as well as instability in the middle east or other oil producing regions and new regulations or restrictions relating to energy production including with respect to hydraulic fracturing could further   negatively affect our businesses that supply the oil and gas industry increasing fuel costs could negatively affect the markets of our commercial aviation businesses in addition financial market fluctuations affect the value of our pension assets changes in the policies of us and foreign governments could result over time in reductions or realignment in defense or other government spending and further changes in programs in which the company participates 

while teledyne’s growth strategy includes possible acquisitions we cannot provide any assurance as to when if or on what terms any acquisitions will be made acquisitions involve various inherent risks such as among others our ability to integrate acquired businesses retain customers and achieve identified financial and operating synergies there are additional risks associated with acquiring owning and operating businesses outside of the united states including those arising from us and foreign government policy changes or actions and exchange rate fluctuations 

we continue to take action to assure compliance with the internal controls disclosure controls and other requirements of 

the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 while we believe our control systems are effective there are inherent limitations in all control systems and misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and may not be detected 

additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in the forwardlooking statements is contained beginning on page 13 of this form 10k under the caption “risk factors cautionary statement as to forwardlooking statements” forwardlooking statements are generally accompanied by words such as “estimate” “project” “predict” “believes” or “expect” that convey the uncertainty of future events or outcomes we assume no obligation to publicly update or revise any forwardlooking statements whether as a result of new information or otherwise

customers 

we have hundreds of customers in the various industries we serve no commercial customer accounted for more than 10 of our total sales nor more than 10 of any segment sales during 2014  2013  or 2012  our largest commercial customer a customer of our instrumentation segment accounted for 28  36  and 34  of total sales in 2014  2013  and 2012  respectively 

sales to international customers accounted for approximately 45  of total sales in 2014  compared with 44  in 2013  and 39  in 2012  in 2014  we sold products to customers in over 100 foreign countries approximately 90 of our sales to foreignbased customers were made to customers in 24 foreign countries the 2014  top five countries for international sales were the united kingdom  norway  china  germany  and south korea  and constituted approximately 21  of our total sales 

approximately 25  27  and 32  of our total sales for 2014  2013  and 2012  respectively were derived from contracts with agencies of and prime contractors to the us government information on our sales to the us government including direct sales as a prime contractor and indirect sales as a subcontractor is as follows in millions 



our principal us government customer is the us department of defense these sales represented 20  21  and 26  of our total sales for 2014  2013  and 2012  respectively in 2014 and 2013 our largest program with the us government was the objective simulation framework contract with the missile defense agency which represented 13 and 14 of our total sales respectively in 2012 our largest program with the us government was the systems development and operations support contract with nasa’s marshall space flight center which represented 19 of our total sales in 2012 

as described under risk factors there are risks associated with doing business with the us government in 2014  approximately 58  of our us government prime contracts and subcontracts were fixedprice type contracts compared to 60  in 2013  and 59  in 2012  under these types of contracts we bear the inherent risk that actual performance cost may exceed the fixed contract price such contracts are typically not subject to renegotiation of profits if we fail to anticipate technical problems estimate costs accurately or control costs during performance additionally us government contracts are subject to termination by the us government at its convenience without identification of any default when contracts are terminated for convenience we typically recover costs incurred or committed settlement expenses and profit on work completed prior to termination we had three  us government contracts terminated for convenience in 2014  compared with four  in 2013  and six  in 2012  

our total backlog of confirmed orders was approximately 9446 million  at december 28 2014  compared with 9412 million  at december 29 2013  and 9525 million  at december 30 2012  we expect to fulfill 99  of such backlog of confirmed orders during 2015  

raw materials and suppliers 

generally our businesses have experienced minimal fluctuations in the supply of raw materials but not without some price volatility while some of our businesses provide services for those businesses that sell hardware and product a portion of the value that we provide is labor oriented such as design engineering assembly and test activities in manufacturing our products we use our own production capabilities and also third party suppliers and subcontractors including international sources some of the items we use for the manufacture of our products including certain gyro components for some marine navigation applications certain magnets and helix wire for our traveling wave tubes and certain infrared detectors substrates certain ceramics and molding compounds used in our sonar systems as well as certain scintillator materials use in the production of our xray detectors are purchased from limited or single sources including international sources due to technical capability price and other factors while over the years we have not experienced much difficulty in procuring raw materials components subassemblies and other supplies required in our manufacturing processes disruption in the global economy and financial markets could trigger increased pricing or otherwise affect our suppliers and negatively impact our ability to procure such supplies 

sales and marketing 

our sales and marketing approach varies by segment and by products within our segments a shared fundamental tenet is the commitment to work closely with our customers to understand their needs with an aim to secure preferred supplier and longerterm relationships 

our segments use a combination of internal sales forces distributors and commissioned sales representatives to market and sell our products and services our teledyne instruments companies and other businesses have been working over the years to consolidate or share internal sales and servicing efforts several teledyne businesses have been marketing and selling products collaboratively to similar customers to promote “onestop” shopping under singular “brand” names including teledyne oil  gas teledyne marine teledyne nuclear teledyne water quality and teledyne microwave solutions 

products are also advertised in appropriate trade journals and by means of various websites to promote our products and other capabilities our personnel regularly participate in relevant trade shows and professional associations 

many of our government contracts are awarded after a competitive bidding process in which we seek to emphasize our ability to provide superior products and technical solutions in addition to competitive pricing 

through teledyne technologies international corp and other subsidiaries we have established offices in foreign countries to facilitate international sales for various businesses locations include brazil china france germany italy japan malaysia singapore south korea switzerland and the united arab emirates 

competition 

we believe that technological capabilities and innovation and the ability to invest in the development of new and enhanced products are critical to obtaining and maintaining leadership in our markets and the industries in which we compete although we have certain advantages that we believe help us compete effectively in our markets each of our markets is highly competitive because of the diversity of products sold and the number of markets we serve we encounter a wide variety of competitors none of which we believe offer all of the same product and service lines or serve all of the same markets as we do our businesses vigorously compete on the basis of quality product performance and reliability technical expertise price and service many of our competitors have and potential competitors could have greater name recognition a larger installed base of products more extensive engineering manufacturing marketing and distribution capabilities and greater financial technological and personnel resources than we do 

  research and development 

our research and development efforts primarily involve engineering and design related to improving existing products and developing new products and technologies in the same or similar fields we spent a total of 4288 million  in 2014  3882 million  in 2013  and 3642 million  in 2012  on research and development and bid and proposal costs customerfunded research and development most of which was attributable to work under contracts with the us government represented approximately 61  of total research and development costs for 2014  compared with 57  of total research and development costs for 2013  and 64  in 2012  

in 2014  we incurred 1669 million  in companyfunded research and development and bid and proposal costs we expect the level of companyfunded research and development and bid and proposal costs to be approximately 1800 million  in 2015  

intellectual property 

while we own and control various intellectual property rights including patents trade secrets confidential information trademarks trade names and copyrights which in the aggregate are of material importance to our business we believe that our business as a whole is not materially dependent upon any one intellectual property or related group of such properties we own several hundred active patents and are licensed to use certain patents technology and other intellectual property rights owned and controlled by others similarly other companies are licensed to use certain patents technology and other intellectual property rights owned and controlled by us 

patents patent applications and license agreements will expire or terminate over time by operation of law in accordance with their terms or otherwise we do not expect the expiration or termination of these patents patent applications and license agreements to have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition

risk factors cautionary statement as to forwardlooking statements 

the following text highlights various risks and uncertainties associated with teledyne these factors could materially affect “forwardlooking statements” within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 that we may make from time to time including forwardlooking statements contained in “item 1 business” and “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” of this form 10k and in teledyne’s 2014  annual report to stockholders it is not possible for management to predict all such factors and new factors may emerge additionally management cannot assess the impact of each such factor on teledyne or the extent to which any factor or combination of factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forwardlooking statements 

  

a new global recession continued economic uncertainty in europe or an economic downturn in china may adversely affect us 

if another global recession emerges if economic uncertainty in europe continues or worsens or if economic growth in china substantially slows we may experience declines in revenues profitability and cash flows from reduced orders payment delays collection difficulties increased price pressures for our products increased risk of excess and obsolete inventories or other factors caused by the economic problems of customers if negative conditions in the global credit markets prevent our customers’ access to credit or render them insolvent orders for our products may decrease which would result in lower revenue likewise if our suppliers face challenges in obtaining credit in selling their products or otherwise in operating their businesses or remaining solvent they may become unable to offer the materials we use to manufacture our products these events could adversely impact our ability to manufacture affected products and could also result in reductions in our revenue increased price competition and increased operating costs which could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we develop and manufacture products for customers in the energy exploration and production markets domestic and international commercial aerospace markets the semiconductor industry the consumer electronics and automotive industries each of which has been cyclical and suffered from fluctuating market demands a cyclical downturn in these markets may materially affect future operating results 

in addition we sell products and services to customers in industries that are sensitive to the level of general economic activity and consumer spending habits and in more mature industries that are sensitive to capacity adverse economic conditions affecting these industries may reduce demand for our products and services which may reduce our revenues profits or production levels for example several of our major customers have recently announced a reduction in their marine seismic operations including reduction in the size of their fleets and steps to reduce costs and capital expenditures in connection with a general slowdown in the marine seismic exploration industry some of our businesses serve industries such as power generation and petrochemical refining which may be negatively impacted by reductions in global capital expenditures and manufacturing capacity 

we are subject to the risks associated with international sales and international operations which could harm our business or results of operations 

during 2014  sales to international customers accounted for approximately 45  of our total revenues compared with 44  in 2013  and 39  in 2012  in 2014  we sold products to customers in over 100 countries the 2014  top five countries for international sales were the united kingdom  norway  china  germany  and south korea  constituting 21  of our total sales our acquisitions including bolt in 2014 reson in 2013 lecroy in 2012 and dalsa in 2011 contributed to greater international sales we anticipate that future sales to international customers will continue to account for a significant and increasing percentage of our revenues particularly since business and growth plans for many teledyne businesses focus on sales outside of the united states including to emerging markets such as china brazil and west africa 

risks associated with international sales include 

 13 

 any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition exchange rate fluctuations may negatively affect the cost of our products to international customers and therefore reduce our competitive position with the 2011 acquisition of canadabased dalsa and the 2012 acquisitions of the majority interest in the parent company of optech also canadabased volatility in the value of the canadian dollar relative to the us dollar or other foreign currencies could adversely affect the business operations and the financial condition of our digital imaging segment our ukbased businesses and sales to customers in the uk could be adversely impacted by uncertainty related to continued uk membership in the european union and continued austerity measures imposed by the uk government 

sales of our products and services internationally are subject to us and local government regulations and procurement policies and practices including regulations relating to importexport control violations of export control rules could result in the impositions of fines and penalties or the suspension of our ability to export items from one or more businesses or the entire corporation depending on the scope of the suspension this could have a material effect on our ability to perform certain international contracts 

among other things we are subject to the us foreign corrupt practices act or fcpa which generally prohibits us companies and their intermediaries from bribing foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or keeping business or otherwise obtaining favorable treatment further in 2011 the united kingdom also implemented the uk bribery act which raised the bar for antibribery law enforcement and compliance relative to the fcpa any determination that we had violated the fcpa the uk bribery act or equivalent antibribery and corruption laws in countries in which we do business could result in sanctions that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations while we have procedures and compliance programs in place and conduct fcpa and other trainings we cannot provide assurance that our internal controls will always protect us from misconduct by our employees agents or business partners 

our international operations are subject to risks customarily encountered in foreign operations including interruption to transportation flows for delivery of parts to us and finished goods to our customers changes in a specific country’s or region’s political or economic conditions trade protection measures import or export licensing requirements consequences from changes in tax laws and regulatory requirements difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations differing labor regulations differing protection of intellectual property and geopolitical turmoil including terrorism and war we are also exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk inherent in our sales commitments anticipated sales and expenses and assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the local functional currency and may also become subject to interest rate risk inherent in any debt we incur or investment portfolios we hold 

an increasingly material amount of our total revenues is derived from companies in the oil and gas industry especially the offshore oil and gas industry a historically cyclical industry with levels of activity that are significantly affected by the levels and volatility of oil and gas prices 

an increasingly material amount of our total revenues is derived from customers in or connected to the oil and gas exploration development and production especially the offshore oil and gas industry our largest commercial customer is in the offshore oil and gas industry and accounted for 28  36  and 34  of total sales in 2014  2013  and 2012  respectively the oil and gas industry is a historically cyclical industry characterized by significant changes in the levels of exploration and development activities in 2014 the price of brent crude oil experienced dramatic declines from a high of 116 in june 2014 to a low of 56 in december 2014 oil and gas prices and market expectations of potential changes in those prices significantly affect the levels of those activities worldwide political economic and military events have contributed to oil and gas price volatility and are likely to continue to do so in the future any prolonged reduction in the overall level of offshore oil and gas exploration and development activities whether resulting from changes in oil and gas prices or otherwise could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations of our businesses within our instrumentation segment some factors that have affected and are likely to continue affecting oil and gas prices and the level of demand for our services and products include the following 

 14 

 

our 2014 acquisition of bolt increases our exposure to offshore oil and gas exploration markets teledyne manufactures seismic sources interconnects and data acquisition products used in offshore energy exploration when crude oil and natural gas prices are low the level of marine seismic exploration activity typically decreases potentially resulting in reduced demand for our products used in offshore energy exploration in addition a decline in the level of capital spending by oil and natural gas companies may result in a reduced pace of development of new energy reserves which could adversely affect demand for our products related to energy production and in certain instances result in the cancellation modification or rescheduling of existing orders 

acquisitions involve inherent risks that may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

our growth strategy includes acquisitions acquisitions involve various inherent risks such as 

 while we conduct financial and other due diligence in connection with our acquisitions and generally seek some form of protection including indemnification from a seller and sometimes an escrow of a portion of the purchase price to cover potential issues such acquired companies may have weaknesses or liabilities that are not accurately assessed or brought to our attention at the time of the acquisition further indemnities or escrows may not fully cover such matters particularly matters identified after a closing 

as they have over the last few years acquisitions may also change the nature and level of various risks faced by teledyne for example our acquisition of bolt in 2014 increases our exposure to the offshore energy exploration market the bolt acquisition the dalsa acquisition in 2011 and the lecroy acquisition in 2012 increased the percentage of sales attributable to commercial customers as opposed to the us government these acquisitions coupled with our acquisitions of additional canadabased companies optech and varisystems and ukbased pdm neptec in 2012 and also our 2013 acquisitions of denmarkbased reson ukbased cdl and netherlandsbased axiom also increased the percentage of revenues and expenses that arise from international sources and consequently our exposure to us and foreign policy changes and exchange rate fluctuations additionally both dalsa’s and lecroy’s businesses have been more capital intensive than other teledyne businesses increasing teledyne’s capital requirements 

under sec rules teledyne must issue a report on management’s assessment of the effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting the sec permits a limited timebased exclusion for acquisitions to give a company an opportunity to evaluate more fully the internal controls of acquired companies and correct deficiencies and institute new or additional internal controls our 2014 management’s report specifically excludes from its scope and coverage our 2014 acquisitions of bolt oceanscience atlas and photon allowing us additional time to evaluate existing internal controls and implement additional controls as appropriate with regard to future acquisitions we can provide no assurance that we will be able to provide a report that contains no significant deficiencies or material weaknesses with respect to these acquired companies or other acquisitions 

in connection with our acquisitions including ones which we do not complete we may incur significant transaction costs we are required to expense as incurred such transaction costs which may have an adverse impact on our quarterly financial results further the acquisitions of public companies such as bolt and lecroy now routinely trigger purported class action 

lawsuits filed by shareholders of the target companies the defense of which has increased transaction costs among other things 

united states and global responses to terrorism the winding down of war in afghanistan continuing turmoil in middle eastern countries concerns regarding nuclear proliferation and the safety of nuclear energy potential epidemics financial issues facing airlines and volatile energy prices increase uncertainties with respect to many of our businesses and may adversely affect our business and results of operations 

united states’ and global responses to terrorism the winding down of war in afghanistan continuing turmoil in middle eastern countries and nuclear proliferation concerns increase uncertainties with respect to us and other business and financial markets and could adversely affect our business and operations 

air travel declines have occurred after terrorist attacks and heightened security alerts as well as after the h1n1 virus sars and bird flu scares while travel by our sales and service personnel to various regions has been affected by such factors additional declines in air travel resulting from such factors and other factors could adversely affect the financial condition of many of our commercial airline and aircraft manufacturer customers and in turn could adversely affect our aerospace and defense electronics segment in addition a prolonged virus epidemic or pandemic or the threat thereof could result in worker absences lower productivity voluntary closure of our offices and manufacturing facilities disruptions in our supply chain travel restrictions on our employees and other disruptions to our businesses moreover health epidemics may force local health and government authorities to mandate the temporary closure of our offices and manufacturing facilities 

deterioration of financial performance of airlines could result in a reduction of discretionary spending for upgrades of avionics and inflight communications equipment which would adversely affect our aerospace and defense electronics segment 

higher oil prices could adversely affect commercial airlinerelated customers of our aerospace and defense electronics segment conversely lower oil prices could decrease oil exploration and petrochemical refining activities and hinder our marine and other instrumentation businesses in addition instability in the middle east or other oilproducing regions could adversely affect expansion plans of the oil and gas industry customers of our instrumentation and cable solutions businesses 

our dependence on revenue from government contracts subjects us to many risks 

our revenue from government contracts depends on the continued availability of funding from the us government and accordingly we have the risk that funding for our existing contracts may be canceled or diverted to other uses or delayed 

we perform work on a number of contracts with the us department of defense and other agencies and departments of the us government including subcontracts with government prime contractors sales under contracts with the us government as a whole including sales under contracts with the us department of defense as prime contractor or subcontractor represented approximately 25  of our total revenue in 2014  compared with 27  in 2013  and 32  in 2012  performance under government contracts has inherent risks that could have a material effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

government contracts are conditioned upon the continuing availability of congressional appropriations and the failure of congress to appropriate funds for programs in which we participate could negatively affect our results of operations the us government shutdown during 2013 negatively affected many of our businesses and the failure by congress to approve future budgets on a timely basis could delay procurement of our services and products and cause us to lose future revenues additionally defense spending is expected to continue to decline in some areas over the next few years a continued emphasis on federal deficit and debt reduction could lead to a further decrease in overall defense spending the continued war on terrorism and the winding down of the war in afghanistan also could result in a diversion of funds from programs in which teledyne participates budgetary concerns could result in future contracts being awarded more on price than on other competitive factors and smaller defense budgets could result in government insourcing of programs and more intense competition on programs that are not insourced which could result in lower revenues and profits 

the sequestration provision of the budget control act of 2011 originally imposed 500 billion of defense cuts over nine years starting in fiscal year 2013 which represented approximately 9 of planned defense funding over the period while the twoyear budget agreement set forth in the bipartisan budget act of 2013 lessened the acrosstheboard cuts of sequestration sequestration continues to be in effect including for the us department of defense the twoyear budget agreement reduced the 52 billion that the us department of defense was supposed to lose in 2014 by 21 billion which translates to a 12 reduction compared to 2013 as compared to the originally set 6 reduction cuts for 2015 were reduced by 10 billion sequestration has already negatively affected some of the defense programs in which we participate as well including the missile defense agency’s objective simulation framework program and we expect our defense programs to continue to be negatively impacted by the continuing effects of sequestration or other defense spending delays and cuts 

continued defense spending does not necessarily correlate to continued business for us because not all of the programs in which we participate or have current capabilities may be provided with continued funding changes in policy and budget priorities by the president his administration and our congress for various defense and nasa programs could continue to impact our engineered systems and aerospace and defense electronics segments for example changes in national space policy that affect nasa’s budget have occurred there have also been significant reductions in missile defense budgets we anticipate continuing scrutiny of those budgets to impact our revenues our engineered systems segment may be further impacted by delays in production runs under the jassm and harpoon missile programs the timing of program cycles can affect our results of operations for a particular quarter or year it is not uncommon for the us department of defense to delay the timing of awards for major programs for six to twelve months or more beyond the original projected timeframe as evidenced by the 2013awards of the test execution services and launch augmentation program reductions and delays in research and development funding by the us government may continue to impact our revenues as darpa reviews its programs aimed to technologically enhance us military capabilities and national security changes to the darpa research and technology development programs in which we participate could occur finally various us department of defense initiatives such as the emphasis on insourcing positions to the government and anticipated reductions or cancellations of existing programs could negatively impact our engineered systems segment 

our participation in government programs may decrease or be subject to renegotiation as those programs evolve over time 

the us government has been placing emphasis on small business quotas and increasing small business contract set asides and minimum work percentages in some cases prime contractors are required to reduce participation by large subcontractors like teledyne in order to fill small business quotas and be responsive to proposals and bids as a result our engineered systems segment could be significantly impacted 

over time and for a variety of reasons programs can evolve and affect the extent of our participation for example teledyne brown engineering inc’s groundbased midcourse defense program was negatively impacted by both the nominal end date of development activity and the change in focus of the current administration relative to missile defense 

we have been a significant participant in nasa programs primarily through our engineered systems segment and through teledyne scientific company the current administration introduced significant changes to the national space policy including the cancellation of the nasa’s constellation program which includes ares launch vehicles the administration plans to utilize commercial launch vehicles for crew and cargo iss expeditions and develop a nasa heavy lift launch vehicle for space exploration as a result of these changes we have been attempting to transition our business to meet the needs of the new policy and programs with the further understanding that the existing iss will continue to be fully functional and supported and that the us will continue investment in human space flight while most recently in early 2014 we were awarded a fiveyear 60 million contract by nasa’s marshall space flight center to develop and manufacture the launch vehicle stage adapter for the space launch system failure to further transition our business successfully could result in reduced sales in addition delayed funding and changes in support for nasa’s current space policy could negatively impact our business 

our contracts with the us government are subject to termination rights that could adversely affect us 

most of our us government contracts are subject to termination by the us government either at its convenience or upon the default of the contractor termination for convenience provisions provide only for the recovery of costs incurred or committed settlement expenses and profit on work completed prior to termination termination for default clauses impose liability on the contractor for excess costs incurred by the us government in reprocuring undelivered items from another source we had three  us government contracts terminated for convenience in 2014  compared with four  in 2013  and six  in 2012  no contracts were terminated for default during such threeyear period 

we may lose money or generate less than expected profits on our fixedprice government contracts and we may lose money if we fail to meet certain prespecified targets in government contracts 

there is no guarantee that us government contracts will be profitable a number of our us government prime contracts and subcontracts are fixedprice type contracts  58  of our total us government contracts were fixedprice in 2014  60  in 2013  and 59  in 2012  under these types of contracts we bear the inherent risk that actual performance cost may exceed the fixed contract price under such contracts we must absorb cost overruns notwithstanding the difficulty of estimating all of the costs we will incur in performing these contracts we cannot assure that our contract loss provisions in our financial statements will be adequate to cover all actual future losses we may lose money on some contracts if we fail to meet these estimates 

our business is subject to government contracting regulations and our failure to comply with such laws and regulations could harm our operating results and prospects 

we like other government contractors are subject to various audits reviews and investigations including private party “whistleblower” lawsuits relating to our compliance with federal and state laws more routinely the us government may audit the costs we incur on our us government contracts including allocated indirect costs such audits could result in adjustments to our contract costs any costs found to be improperly allocated to a specific contract will not be reimbursed and such costs already reimbursed would need to be refunded we have recorded contract revenues based upon costs we expect to realize on final audit in a worst case scenario should a business or division involved be charged with wrongdoing or should the us government determine that the business or division is not a “presently responsible contractor” that business or division and conceivably our company as a whole could be temporarily suspended or in the event of a conviction could be debarred for up to three years from receiving new government contracts or governmentapproved subcontracts in addition we could expend substantial amounts defending against such charges and in damages fines and penalties if such charges were proven or were to result in negotiated settlements 

our indebtedness and any failure to comply with our covenants that apply to our indebtedness could materially and adversely affect our business 

as of december 28 2014  we had 6947 million  in total outstanding indebtedness this indebtedness included 3750 million  in senior unsecured notes 2000 million  in term loans 1050 million  under our 7500 million  2013amended credit facility and 147 million  in other debt our indebtedness could harm our business by among other things reducing the funds available to make new strategic acquisitions or reducing our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and market conditions our indebtedness exposes us to interest rate risk since a portion of our debt obligations are at variable rates our indebtedness could also have a material adverse effect on our business by increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions or a downturn in our business general adverse economic and industry conditions or a downturn in our business could result in our inability to repay this indebtedness in a timely manner we may elect to raise other forms of debt capital depending on financial market and economic conditions 

product liability claims product recalls and field service actions could have a material adverse effect on our reputation business results of operations and financial condition and we may have difficulty obtaining product liability and other insurance coverage 

as a manufacturer and distributor of a wide variety of products including monitoring instruments products used in offshore oil and gas production products used in commercial aviation and products used in medical devices most recently including xray detectors our results of operations are susceptible to adverse publicity regarding the quality or safety of our products in part product liability claims challenging the safety of our products may result in a decline in sales for a particular product which could adversely affect our results of operations this could be the case even if the claims themselves are proven untrue or settled for immaterial amounts 

while we have general liability and other insurance policies concerning product liabilities we have selfinsured retentions or deductibles under such policies with respect to a portion of these liabilities awarded damages could be more than our accruals we could incur losses above the aggregate annual policy limit as well we cannot assure that for 2014 and in future years insurance carriers will be willing to renew coverage or provide new coverage for product liability 

product recalls can be expensive and tarnish our reputation and have a material adverse effect on the sales of our products 

we have been joined among a number of defendants often over 100 in lawsuits alleging injury or death as a result of exposure to asbestos in addition because of the prominent “teledyne” name we may continue to be mistakenly joined in lawsuits involving a company or business that was not assumed by us as part of our 1999 spinoff to date we have not incurred material liabilities in connection with these lawsuits however our historic insurance coverage including that of its predecessors may not fully cover such claims and the defense of such matters coverage typically depends on the year of purported exposure and other factors nonetheless we intend to vigorously defend our position against these claims 

certain gas generators historically manufactured by teledyne energy systems inc contained a sealed wetted asbestos component while the company has transitioned to a replacement material had placed warning labels on its products and took care in the handling of this discontinued material by employees there is no assurance that the company will not face product liability or workers compensation claims involving this component 

our teledyne brown engineering inc’s laboratory in knoxville tennessee performs radiological analyses our teledyne dalsa professional imaging unit develops image sensors used in medical and dental xray applications in addition our teledyne dalsa digital imaging unit develops equipment and sensors used in eye examination and general surgical vision applications errors and omissions in analyses may occur or erroneous images could be captured our insurance coverage or indemnities may not be adequate to cover potential problems associated with faulty radiological analyses 

teledyne brown engineering inc and other teledyne companies manufacture components for customers in the nuclear power market including utilities and certain governmental entities certain liabilities associated with such products are covered by the price anderson act and other statutory and common law defenses and we have received indemnities from some of our customers however there is no assurance we will not face product liability claims related to such products or that our exposure will not exceed the amounts for which we have liability coverage or protection 

we cannot assure that we will not have additional product liability claims or that we will not recall any products 

our pension expense and the value of our pension assets are affected by factors outside of our control including the performance of plan assets the stock market interest rates and actuarial experience 

we have a defined benefit qualified pension plan covering most of our us employees hired prior to 2004 or approximately 18 of our active employees the value of the combined pension assets is currently greater than our qualified pension benefit obligation the accounting rules applicable to our qualified pension plan require that amounts recognized in the financial statements be determined on an actuarial basis rather than as contributions are made to the plan two significant elements in determining our pension income or pension expense are the expected return on plan assets and the discount rate used in projecting pension benefit obligations declines in the stock market and lower rates of return could increase required contributions to our qualified pension plan andor result in a change to shareholders’ equity our investment strategy may not produce the expected returns if the credit financial or stock markets deteriorate any decreases or increases in market interest rates will affect the discount rate assumption used in projecting pension benefit obligations in addition changes in other actuarial assumptions such as mortality assumptions or change due to legislative or regulatory actions could impact our pension income or expense as well as funding obligations recently the society of actuaries released revised mortality tables which update life expectancy assumptions in consideration of these tables we modified the mortality assumptions used in determining our pension and postretirement benefit obligations as of december 28 2014 which will have a related impact on our future pension and postretirement benefit expense in 2012 in an effort to reduce the risks associated with our current and future domestic pension obligation we amended the pension plan to change the rate at which pension benefits accrue after february 29 2012 in 2012 and in 2014 we offered and made lump sum payments to certain participants in the plan whose employment with teledyne had terminated in 2014  2013  and 2012  we have made aggregate voluntary pretax cash contributions of 1758 million  to the domestic pension plan if and to the extent decreases in our pension assets are not offset by voluntary contributions recovered through future asset returns mitigated by an increase in the rate at which the benefit obligation is discounted or other actions our required cash contributions and pension expense could increase under the plans for additional discussion of pension matters see the discussion under “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition” and notes 2 and 12 to notes to consolidated financial statements 

our business and operations could suffer in the event of cyber security breaches 

attempts by others to gain unauthorized access to our information technology systems have become more sophisticated and are sometimes successful these attempts which might be related to industrial or foreign government espionage activism or other motivations include covertly introducing malware to our computers and networks performing reconnaissance impersonating authorized users and stealing or corrupting data among other activities we continue to update our infrastructure security tools and processes to protect against security incidents including both external and internal threats and to prevent their recurrence company personnel and third parties have been tasked to detect and investigate such incidents but it is possible that we might not prevent or be aware of an incident or its magnitude and effects the theft unauthorized use or publication of our intellectual property andor confidential business information could harm our competitive position reduce the value of our investment in research and development and other strategic initiatives or otherwise adversely affect our business we are subject to us department of defense regulations applicable to certain types of data residing on or transiting through certain information systems and we expect these regulations will be incorporated into certain contracts we hold to the extent that any security breach results in inappropriate disclosure of confidential or controlled information of employees third parties or the us government we may incur liability or the loss of contracts or security clearances as a result in addition we expect to continue devoting additional resources to the security of our information technology systems more resources may be required in the defense arena to the extent the us government increases its cyber security mandates 

our future financial results could be adversely impacted by asset impairment charges 

december 28 2014  teledyne’s goodwill was 11506 million  and net acquired intangible assets were 2776 million  under current accounting guidance we are required to test annually both acquired goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment based upon a fair value approach rather than amortizing them over time we have chosen to perform our annual impairment reviews of goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year we also are required to test goodwill for impairment between annual tests if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce our enterprise fair value below its book value these events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate including a significant sustained decline in an entity’s market value legal factors operating performance indicators competition sale or disposition of a significant portion of the business or other factors if the fair market value is less than the carrying value including goodwill we could be required to record an 

impairment charge the valuation of reporting units requires judgment in estimating future cash flows discount rates and estimated product life cycles in making these judgments we evaluate the financial health of the business including such factors as industry performance changes in technology and operating cash flows as we have grown through acquisitions the amount of goodwill and net acquired intangible assets is significant compared with our total assets as a result the amount of any annual or interim impairment could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our reported financial results for the period in which the charge is taken we also may be required to record an earnings charge or incur unanticipated expenses if as a result of a change in strategy or other reason we were to determine the value of other assets had been impaired 

we may not have sufficient resources to fund all future research and development and capital expenditures or possible acquisitions 

in order to remain competitive we must make substantial investments in research and development of new or enhanced products and continuously upgrade our process technology and manufacturing capabilities in september 2006 we acquired a provider of research and development services primarily in the areas of electronics optics information sciences and materials technologies that is currently teledyne scientific company and in 2013 2012 and 2011 we acquired reson lecroy and dalsa respectively each of which had historically made significant investments in research and development relative to total revenues our teledyne scientific company subsidiary has been actively promoting and funding joint research and development projects with other teledyne businesses including our teledyne oil  gas businesses teledyne reynolds inc teledyne brown engineering inc dalsa and lecroy additionally some of our businesses are actively pursuing governmental support and funding for some of their research and development initiatives including dalsa with respect to its cmos and uncooled infrared image sensor development efforts nonetheless we may be unable to fund all of our research and development and capital investment needs or possible acquisitions our ability to raise additional capital will depend on a variety of factors some of which will not be within our control including the existence of bank and capital markets investor perceptions of us our businesses and the industries in which we operate and general economic conditions failure to successfully raise needed capital on a timely or costeffective basis could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition in addition if we fail to accurately predict future customer needs and preferences or fail to produce viable technologies we may invest heavily in research and development of products that do not lead to significant revenue which would adversely affect our profitability 

we may be unsuccessful in our efforts to increase our participation in new markets 

we intend to both adapt our existing technologies and develop new products to expand into new market segments we may be unsuccessful in accessing these and other new markets if our products do not meet our customers’ requirements as a result of changes in either technology and industry standards or because of actions taken by our competitors 

limitations in customer funding for applied research and development and technology insertion projects and government support for research and development expenditures may reduce our ability to apply our ongoing investments in some market areas 

we may be unable to successfully introduce new and enhanced products in a timely and costeffective manner which could harm our growth and prospects 

our operating results depend in part on our ability to introduce new and enhanced products on a timely basis in order to improve our product development capabilities we purchased the research center that is now teledyne scientific company in 2006 and in 2011 we purchased dalsa which has access to a wellequipped mems research and development center in 2013 we opened a 52000squarefoot technology development center in daytona beach florida primarily to serve the offshore oil and gas production and exploration industries deepwater and harsh environments demand new materials and technology from our teledyne oil  gas businesses to support high temperature high pressure locations successful product development and introduction depend on numerous factors including our ability to anticipate customer and market requirements changes in technology and industry standards our ability to differentiate our offerings from offerings of our competitors and market acceptance we may not be able to develop and introduce new or enhanced products in a timely and costeffective manner or to develop and introduce products that satisfy customer requirements 

our new products also may not achieve market acceptance or correctly address new industry standards and technological changes we may also lose any technological advantage to competitors if we fail to develop new products in a timely manner 

additionally new products may trigger increased warranty costs as such products are tested further by actual usage accelerated entry of new products to meet heightened market demand and competitive pressures may cause additional warranty costs as development and testing time periods might be accelerated or condensed 

technological change and evolving industry and regulatory standards could cause some of our products or services to become obsolete or noncompetitive 

the markets for some of our products and services are characterized by rapid technological development evolving industry standards changes in customer requirements and new product introductions and enhancements a faster than anticipated change in one or more of the technologies related to our products or services or in market demand for products or services based on a particular technology could result in faster than anticipated obsolescence of certain of our products or services and could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition currently accepted industry and regulatory standards are also subject to change which may contribute to the obsolescence of our products or services 

we may not be able to reduce the costs of our products to satisfy customers’ cost reduction mandates which could harm our sales or margins 

more and more customers continue to seek price reductions of our products while we continually work to reduce our manufacturing and other costs of our products without affecting product quality and reliability there is no assurance that we will be able to do so and do so in a timely manner to satisfy the pricing pressures of our customers cost reductions of raw materials and other components used in our products may be beyond our control depending on market credit and economic conditions customers may seek lower cost products from china and other developing countries where manufacturing costs are lower 

the airline industry is heavily regulated and if we fail to comply with applicable requirements our results of operations could suffer 

governmental agencies throughout the world including the us federal aviation administration or the faa prescribe standards and qualification requirements for aircraft components including virtually all commercial airline and general aviation products specific regulations vary from country to country although compliance with faa requirements generally satisfies regulatory requirements in other countries if any material authorization or approval qualifying us to supply our products is revoked or suspended then the sale of the product would be prohibited by law which would have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

from time to time the faa or equivalent regulatory agencies in other countries propose new regulations or changes to existing regulations which are usually more stringent than existing regulations if these proposed regulations are adopted and enacted we may incur significant additional costs to achieve compliance which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  increasing competition could reduce the demand for our products and services 

each of our markets is highly competitive many of our competitors have and potential competitors could have greater name recognition a larger installed base of products more extensive engineering manufacturing marketing and distribution capabilities and greater financial technological and personnel resources than we do new or existing competitors may also develop new technologies that could adversely affect the demand for our products and services industry acquisition and consolidation trends particularly among aerospace and defense contractors have adversely impacted demand for our aerospace and defense related engineering services as large prime contractors insource increased amounts of major acquisition programs and also require significant expansion in small business participation to meet government contracting goals lowcost competition from china and other developing countries could also result in decreased demand for our products increasing competition could reduce the volume of our sales or the prices we may charge which would negatively impact our revenues smaller defense budgets both in the united states and europe could result in additional competition for new and existing defense programs 

we sell products to customers in industries that may again undergo rapid and unpredictable changes which could adversely affect our operational results or production levels 

we develop and manufacture products for customers in industries that have undergone rapid changes in the past including the semiconductor and the telecommunications industries in 2009 dalsa experienced a significant decline in demand for its products for the semiconductor and electronics inspection industries these industries or others that we serve may exhibit rapid changes in the future and may adversely affect our operating results or our production levels or both 

our business and financial results could be adversely affected by conditions and other factors associated with our suppliers 

some items we purchase for the manufacture of our products are purchased from limited or single sources of supply due to technical capability price and other factors for example dalsa has an internal single source of supply for ccd semiconductor wafers used to assemble image sensors and an external single source of supply for cmos semiconductor wafers used to assemble xray panel products lecroy continues to outsource a portion of its research and development activities to a third party engineering firm in malaysia where it may be more difficult for us to enforce our intellectual property rights we 

have also outsourced from time to time the manufacturing of certain parts components subsystems and even finished products to single or limited sources including international sources disruption of these sources could cause delays or reductions in shipments of our products or increases in our costs which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or operations international sources possess additional risks some of which are similar to those described above in regard to international sales with any continuing disruption in the global economy and financial markets some of our suppliers may also continue to face issues gaining access to sufficient credit and materials to maintain their businesses which could reduce the availability of some components and to the extent such suppliers are single source suppliers could adversely affect our ability to continue to manufacture and sell our products continuing economic pressure on suppliers especially suppliers in the defense industry may also trigger increased pricing or workforce reductions or reduced workweeks and a shrinking supply base possibly creating longer lead times to obtain needed components for our products delays in material acceptance and a greater risk of receiving counterfeit parts 

some of our commercial product lines may have one or a limited number of customers the loss of which could adversely affect our business or financial results 

while no commercial customer accounted for more than 10 of our total sales during 2014  2013  and 2012  and we have hundreds of customers in the various industries that we serve some of our product lines may have one or a few key customers the loss of which could adversely affect our business or financial results teledyne’s largest commercial customer a customer of our instrumentation segment accounted for 28  36  and 34  of total sales in 2014  2013  and 2012  respectively 

newer products such as our xray panel products may initially be more heavily dependent on a singular or limited number of customers until market acceptance is obtained or due to contractual terms similarly some older product lines may be more heavily dependent on a singular or limited number of customers in either such case program delays of such customer or customers as well as the loss of such customer or customers could adversely affect our business or financial results 

we face risks related to sales through distributors and other third parties that we do not control which could harm our business 

we sell a portion of our products through third parties such as distributors valueadded resellers and oems collectively “distributors” using third parties for distribution exposes teledyne to many risks including competitive pressure concentration credit risk and compliance risks we may rely on one or more key distributors for a product and the loss of these distributors could reduce our revenue distributors may face financial difficulties including bankruptcy which could harm our collection of accounts receivables and financial results violations of the fcpa or similar antibribery laws by distributors or other third party intermediaries could have a material impact on our business failing to manage risks related to our use of distributors may reduce sales increase expenses and weaken our competitive position and could result in sanctions against us 

compliance with increasing environmental and climate change regulations as well as the effects of potential environmental liabilities could have a material adverse financial effect on us 

we like other industry participants are subject to various federal state local and international environmental laws and regulations we may be subject to increasingly stringent environmental standards in the future particularly as greenhouse gas emissions and climate change regulations and initiatives increase future developments administrative actions or liabilities relating to environmental and climate change matters could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition environmental regulations on hydraulic fracturing and the use of seismic energy sources for offshore energy exploration could adversely affect some product lines of our instrumentation segment 

our manufacturing operations could expose us to material environmental liabilities and companies we acquire may have environmental liabilities that are not accurately assessed or brought to our attention at the time of the acquisition in 2013 we established an environmental reserve related to potential soil remediation activities at a former leased facility which as of december 28 2014 was 52 million 

for additional discussion of environmental matters see the discussion under the caption “other matters  environmental” of “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of results of operation and financial condition” and note 15 to our notes to consolidated financial statements 

the us environmental protection agency “epa” has focused on greenhouse gases “ghgs” maintaining ghgs threaten the public health and welfare of the american people the epa also maintains that ghg emissions from onroad vehicles contribute to that threat the epa’s endangerment finding covers emissions of six greenhouse gases the epa’s continuing efforts to limit ghg emissions could adversely affect our us manufacturing operations increase prices for energy fuel and transportation require us to accommodate changes in parameters such as the way parts are manufactured and may in some cases require us to redesign of certain products this could lead to increased costs which we may not be able to recover from customers delays in product shipments and loss of market share to competitors 

our inability to attract and retain key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our future success 

our future success depends to a significant extent upon the continued service of our executive officers and other key management and technical personnel and on our ability to continue to attract retain and motivate qualified personnel we also have a maturing work force while we have engaged in succession planning the loss of the services of one or more of our key employees or our failure to attract retain and motivate qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we may not be able to sell exit or reconfigure businesses that we determine no longer meet with our growth strategy 

consistent with our strategy to emphasize growth in our core markets we continually evaluate our businesses to ensure that they are aligned with our strategy this review led to the decision to sell our general aviation piston engine businesses which sale was completed in april 2011 as a result of our review and declines in our electronic manufacturing services businesses in 2013 we closed our teledyne microelectronics technologies’ facility in marina del rey california and relocated several of its product lines to other teledyne locations in further response to downturns in our defense businesses in 2013 we also began consolidating some of our microelectronic component operations into our mountain view california facility and also our shipley england facility and relatedly sold a former manufacturing site in sunnyvale california additionally we closed teledyne cml group limited’s precision machining and fabrications business in birkenhead england to focus more on its advanced composites manufacturing business 

our ability to dispose of exit or reconfigure businesses that may no longer be aligned with our growth strategy will depend on many factors including the terms and conditions of any asset purchase and sale agreement as well as industry business and economic conditions we cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to sell nonstrategic businesses on terms that are acceptable to us or at all in addition if the sale of any nonstrategic business cannot be consummated or is not practical alternative courses of action including relocation of product lines or closure may not be available to us or may be more costly than anticipated 

natural and manmade disasters could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

several of our facilities as a result of their locations could be subject to a catastrophic loss caused by earthquakes hurricanes tornados floods ice storms or other natural disasters many of our production facilities and our headquarters are located in california and thus are in areas with above average seismic activity and may also be at risk of damage in wildfires teledyne dalsa’s semiconductor facilities in quebec canada have been impacted by severe ice storms including a storm in 2013 in addition we have manufacturing facilities in the southeastern united states and texas that have been threatened and struck by major hurricanes in october 2012 lecroy and other teledyne facilities incurred business interruptions and were without power for several days as a result of hurricane sandy our facilities in alabama florida nebraska tennessee and virginia have also been threatened by tornados in june 2012 a tornado caused substantial damage to and interrupted business at our teledyne hastings instruments facility in hampton virginia in april 2011 tornados caused substantial damage in huntsville alabama while teledyne brown engineering’s main facility in huntsville alabama incurred minimal building damage and business interruption the facility was without power for several days if any of our california facilities including our california headquarters were to experience a catastrophic earthquake or wildfire loss or if any of our alabama florida louisiana nebraska tennessee or texas facilities were to experience a catastrophic hurricane storm tornado or other natural disaster or if dalsa’s facilities in quebec experience longterm loss of electrical power such event could disrupt our operations delay production shipments and revenue and result in large expenses to repair or replace the facility or facilities while teledyne has property insurance to partially reimburse it for losses caused by windstorm and earth movement such insurance would not cover all possible losses in addition our existing disaster recovery and business continuity plans including those relating to our information technology systems may not be fully responsive to or minimize losses associated with catastrophic events 

the environmental disaster triggered by the deepwater horizon rig explosion and oil spill in 2010 resulted in a moratorium on offshore oil and gas production in the gulf of mexico that adversely affected the results of operations of some of our teledyne oil and gas businesses although such adverse impact was offset in part by the products we manufacture that supported wellcapping and environmental cleanup efforts environmental regulations enacted in the wake of this oil spill have resulted in increased compliance costs to some of our teledyne oil and gas businesses similar future manmade disasters that limit or cease offshore oil and gas production or further exploration in the regions in which we sell our products could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

disasters that do not directly impact us can have an indirect adverse impact on our business for example in 2011 the earthquake in northern japan and the related tsunami and severe flooding in thailand resulted in certain of our customers delaying orders for our products because they were unable to obtain critical supplies from vendors in the impacted areas 

teledyne brown engineering inc is building an imaging platform to be affixed to the iss for the program to be financially successful the 16 yearold iss must continue to fly in a safe and human tended condition while certain 

spaceflight risks such as a high velocity debris impact to the station causing significant structural damage or necessitating the evacuation of the iss have been regarded as small if such event were to occur the iss program continuation could be threatened jeopardizing our investment and potential revenue generation from issbased earth imaging 

we may not be able to enforce or protect our intellectual property rights or third parties may claim infringement of their intellectual rights each which may harm our ability to compete and thus harm our business 

our ability to enforce and protect our patents copyrights software licenses trade secrets know how and other intellectual property rights is subject to general litigation risks as well as uncertainty as to the enforceability of our intellectual property rights in various countries when we seek to enforce our rights we have found that various claims may be asserted against us including claims that our intellectual property right is invalid is otherwise not enforceable or is licensed to the party against whom we are asserting a claim in addition we may be the target of aggressive and opportunistic enforcement of patents by third parties if we are not ultimately successful in defending ourselves against these claims in litigation we may not be able to sell a particular product or family of products due to an injunction or we may have to pay damages that could in turn harm our results of operations our inability to enforce our intellectual property rights under these circumstances may harm our competitive position and our business 

increases in our effective tax rate may harm our results of operations 

our effective tax rate for 2014  was 236 compared with 177  for 2013  and 287  for 2012  while there continues to be congressional discussion about lowering the corporate tax rate in the us to improve global competitiveness a number of factors may impact our effective tax rates which could reduce our net income including 

 our inability to efficiently implement changes to our enterprise resource planning software could result in higher than expected costs or otherwise adversely impact our internal controls environment operations and profitability 

we are implementing enterprise resource planning software systems which are intended to improve our business processes in certain business units the costs associated with such systems are significant and we could incur costs in excess of budgeted costs any technical or other difficulties in developing or implementing this initiative may increase the costs of the project and have an adverse effect on our operations and reporting processes including our internal controls over financial reporting as we make adjustments to operations as a result of this project we may incur incremental expenses prior to realizing the benefits of a more efficient workforce and operating structure although implementation has occurred in only selected business units to date and efforts have been made to minimize adverse impacts on our controls we cannot assure that all such impacts have been mitigated further we may not realize anticipated cost improvements and greater efficiencies from the project 

our financial statements are based on estimates required by gaap and actual results may differ materially from those estimated under different assumptions or conditions 

our financial statements are prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states these principles require our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period for example estimates are used when accounting for items such as asset valuations allowances for doubtful accounts allowance for excess and obsolete inventory depreciation and amortization impairment assessments employee benefits taxes recall and warranty costs product and general liability and contingencies while we base our estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances at the time made actual results may differ materially from those estimated our most critical accounting estimates are described in the management discussion in this form 10k under “critical accounting estimates” 

while we believe our internal control systems are effective there are inherent limitations in all control systems and misstatements resulting from error or fraud may occur and may not be detected 

we continue to take action to assure compliance with the internal controls disclosure controls and other requirements of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer cannot guarantee that our internal controls and disclosure controls will prevent all possible errors or all fraud a control system no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met in addition the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefit of controls must be relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no system of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within the company have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake further controls can be circumvented by individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more persons or by management override of the controls the design of any system of controls is also based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions over time a control may be inadequate because of changes in conditions or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate because of inherent limitations in a costeffective control system misstatements resulting from error or fraud may occur and may not be detected 

provisions of our governing documents applicable law and our change in control severance agreements could make an acquisition of teledyne more difficult 

our restated certificate of incorporation our amended and restated bylaws and the general corporation law of the state of delaware contain several provisions that could make the acquisition of control of teledyne in a transaction not approved by our board of directors more difficult we have also entered into change in control severance agreements with thirteen members of our current management which could have an antitakeover effect these provisions may prevent or discourage attempts to acquire our company 

the market price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly since we became a public company and could continue to do so 

since we became an independent public company on november 29 1999 the market price of our common stock has fluctuated substantially and fluctuations in our stock price could continue among the factors that could affect our stock price are 

 the stock markets in general and the markets for high technology companies in particular have experienced a high degree of volatility that is not necessarily related to the operating performance of these companies we cannot provide assurances as to our stock price

the company’s effective tax rate for 2014 was 236 compared with 177 for 2013 the increase primarily reflected lower net discrete tax benefits in 2014 fiscal year 2014 included net discrete tax benefits of 89 million primarily related to the remeasurement of uncertain tax positions primarily due to an expiration of statute of limitations and the favorable resolution of a tax matter total year 2014 also included 56 million in research and development tax credits fiscal year 2013 included net discrete tax benefits of 213 million primarily related to the statute of limitations expirations favorable tax audit resolutions research and development credits and the remeasurement of uncertain tax positions excluding the impact of the net discrete tax benefits of 89 million for 2014 and 213 million for 2013 the effective tax rates would have been 267 for 2014 compared with 271 for 2013 

  during the next twelve months it is reasonably possible that favorable tax audit resolutions and expirations of the statutes of limitations could reduce unrecognized tax benefits by 87 million either because our tax positions are sustained on audit because the company agrees to their disallowance or because of the expiration of the statutes of limitations of the 87 million 05 million would not impact tax expense as it would be offset by the reversal of deferred tax assets 

2013  compared with 2012   



  

the table below presents sales and cost of sales by segment and total company 



we reported 2013 sales of 23386 million compared with sales of 21273 million for 2012 an increase of 99 net income from continuing operations was 1850 million 487 per diluted share for 2013 compared with net income from continuing operations of 1618 million 433 per diluted share for 2012 an increase of 143 net income for 2013 and 2012 also included net discrete tax benefits of 213 million and 54 million respectively net income attributable to teledyne including discontinued operations was 1850 million 487 per diluted share for 2013 compared with 1641 million 439 per diluted share for 2012 

sales 

the increase in sales in 2013 compared with 2012 reflected higher sales in both the instrumentation and aerospace and defense electronics segments partially offset by lower sales in both the engineered systems and digital imaging segments sales in the instrumentation segment reflected 1784 million of incremental sales from acquisitions as well as higher organic sales for marine products increased sales of test and measurement instrumentation of 1036 million reflected the full year contribution from the lecroy acquisition sales of marine products increased by 1067 million and included incremental sales of 653 million from acquisitions sales in the aerospace and defense electronics segment primarily reflected increased sales of 193 million from avionics products and electronic relays sales in the digital imaging segment decreased slightly the decrease in the engineered systems segment revenue primarily reflected lower sales of 238 million from engineered products and services the incremental increase in revenue in 2013 from businesses acquired in 2013 and in 2012 was 1720 million 

sales under contracts with the us government were approximately 27 of sales in 2013 and 32 of sales in 2012 principally reflective of our recent acquisitions such decline has been consistent with our strategy to be less dependent on us government business sales to international customers represented approximately 44 of sales in 2013 and 39 of sales in 2012 

operating income 

segment operating profit and other segment income for 2013 compared with 2012 decreased by 19 million or only 07 despite 240 million in pretax charges for severance and facility consolidation expense and environmental reserves compared with 17 million of similar charges in 2012 for 2013 the charges impacted each business segment as follows aerospace and defense electronics 157 million digital imaging 39 million instrumentation 25 million and engineered systems 19 million in 2012 we incurred 17 million of similar charges which only impacted the aerospace and defense electronics segment segment operating profit and other segment income for 2013 also reflected

financial condition liquidity and capital resources 

principal capital requirements 

our principal capital requirements are to fund working capital needs capital expenditures voluntary and required pension contributions debt service requirements share repurchases and acquisitions it is anticipated that operating cash flow together with available borrowings under the credit facility described below will be sufficient to meet these requirements and could be used to fund acquisitions in 2015 to support acquisitions we may need to raise additional capital our liquidity is not dependent upon the use of offbalance sheet financial arrangements we have no offbalance sheet financing arrangements that incorporate the use of special purpose or unconsolidated entities 

revolving credit agreement senior notes and term loans 

in december 2014 the company issued 1250 million of senior unsecured notes which consisted of 300 million of 261 senior unsecured notes due december 2019 and 950 million of 309 senior unsecured notes due december 2021 

in march 2013 the company amended its 5500 million credit facility to increase the borrowing capacity to 7500 million and extend the maturity date from february 2016 to march 2018 excluding interest and fees no payments are due under the credit facility until it matures in november 2013 the company amended its 2000 million term loan agreements to extend the maturity dates from october 2015 to march 2019 and to lower the applicable interest rate the credit agreements require the company to comply with various financial and operating covenants including maintaining certain consolidated leverage and interest coverage ratios borrowings under our credit facility and term loans are at variable rates which are at our option tied to a eurocurrency rate equal to libor london interbank offered rate plus an applicable rate or a base rate as defined in our credit agreements eurocurrency rate loans may be denominated in us dollars or an alternative currency as defined in the agreement eurocurrency or libor based loans under the facility typically have terms of one two three or six months and the interest rate for each such loan is subject to change if the loan is continued or converted following the applicable maturity date the company has not drawn any loans with a term longer than three months under the credit facility base rate loans have interest rates that primarily fluctuate with changes in the prime rate interest rates are also subject to change based on our consolidated leverage ratio as defined in the credit agreement the credit facility also provides for facility fees that vary between 0125 and 030 of the credit line depending on our consolidated leverage ratio as calculated from time to time 

longterm debt consisted of the following in millions   



the company also has 104 million  in capital leases of which 13 million  is current at december 28 2014  teledyne had 168 million  in outstanding letters of credit 

the credit agreements require the company to comply with various financial and operating covenants including maintaining certain consolidated leverage and interest coverage ratios as well as minimum net worth levels and limits on acquired debt at december 28 2014  the company was in compliance with these covenants and we had a significant amount of margin between required financial covenant ratios and our actual ratios currently we do not believe our ability to undertake additional debt financing if needed is reasonably likely to be materially impacted by debt restrictions under our credit agreements subject to our complying with required financial covenants listed in the table below 

at december 28 2014  the required financial covenant ratios and the actual ratios were as follows   



 available borrowing capacity under the 7500 million credit facility which is reduced by borrowings and outstanding letters of credit was 6297 million  at december 28 2014  the available borrowing capacity does not reflect the payment on february 2 2015 of 1349 million in connection with an accelerated share repurchase agreement teledyne also has a 50 million uncommitted credit line which permits credit extensions up to 50 million plus an incremental 20 million solely for standby letters of credit this credit line is utilized as needed for periodic cash needs no amounts are outstanding under this facility at december 28 2014  the maximum amount that could be borrowed under our 7500 million credit facility as of december 28 2014  while still remaining in compliance with our consolidated leverage ratio covenant was 6297 million  

permanently reinvested earnings 

we consider the earnings of material nonus subsidiaries to be indefinitely invested outside the united states on the basis of estimates that future domestic cash generation will be sufficient to meet future domestic cash requirements at december 28 2014  the amount of undistributed foreign earnings was 1704 million we have not recorded a deferred tax liability of approximately 431 million related to the 1704 million of undistributed foreign earnings should we decide to repatriate the foreign earnings we would need to adjust our income tax provision in the period we determined that the earnings will no longer be indefinitely invested outside the united states 

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our expected cash outflows resulting from financial contracts and commitments at december 28 2014  we have not included information on our normal recurring purchases of materials for use in our operations these amounts are generally consistent from year to year closely reflect our levels of production and are not longterm in nature in millions 



  

 

unrecognized tax benefits of 323 million are not included in the table above because 13 million is offset by deferred tax assets and the remainder cannot be reasonably estimated to be settled in cash due to a lack of prior settlement history 

at december 28 2014  we are not required and are not planning to make any cash contributions to the domestic qualified pension plan for 2015 in addition teledyne does not expect to make any contributions to its foreignbased pension plans in 2015 our minimum funding requirements after 2015 as set forth by erisa are dependent on several factors as discussed under “accounting for pension plans” in the critical accounting policies section of this management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation estimates beyond 2015 have not been provided due to the significant uncertainty of these amounts which are subject to change until the company’s pension assumptions can be updated at the appropriate times in addition certain pension contributions are eligible for future recovery through the pricing of products and services to the us government under certain government contracts therefore the amounts noted are not necessarily indicative of the impact these contributions may have on our liquidity we also have payments due under our other postretirement benefit plans these plans are not required to be funded in advance but are pay as you go see further discussion in note 12 of the notes to consolidated financial statements teledyne intends to continue to monitor and manage its defined pension benefit plans obligation and may take additional actions in the future 

operating activities 

in 2014  net cash provided by operating activities was 2879 million  compared with 2033 million  in 2013  and 1892 million  in 2012  the higher cash provided by operating activities in 2014 compared with 2013 reflected higher net income the absence of pension contributions in 2014 while in 2013 we made a voluntary 830 million pretax cash contribution to the domestic pension plan partially offset by higher income tax payments the 2014 amount also reflected the receipt of 100 million related to a legal settlement the higher cash provided by operating activities in 2013 compared with 2012 reflected lower cash contributions to the domestic pension plan and higher net income partially offset by higher income tax payments the 2012 net cash provided by operating activities includes 928 million in voluntary cash contributions to the domestic pension plan 

free cash flow cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures was 2444 million  in 2014  compared with 1307 million  in 2013  and 1239 million  in 2012  adjusted free cash flow eliminates the impact of pension contributions on a net of tax basis and was 2444 million  in 2014 compared with 1821 million  in 2013  and 1842 million  in 2012  



  

 

working capital 

working capital increased to 4027 million  at yearend 2014  compared with 3810 million  at yearend 2013  the increase reflected the impact the bolt acquisition and higher cash balances partially offset by an increase in current maturities of long term debt 

balance sheet changes 

the changes in the following selected components of teledyne’s balance sheet are discussed below in millions 



the higher balances in accounts receivable inventories goodwill and acquired intangible assets were impacted by the acquisitions made in 2014  the accumulated other comprehensive loss increase reflects the noncash adjustment of 975 million related to the increase in the unfunded pension liability in 2014 and 582 million of foreign currency changes the lower balance in property plant and equipment also reflected the impact of depreciation partially offset by capital spending and acquisitions made in 2014  longterm debt increased and reflected the impact of funds used for acquisitions in 2014 and the 2011 stock repurchase program

the following is a summary at the acquisition date of the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed for the acquisitions and other investments made in fiscal 2014  and 2013  in millions   



financing activities 

cash provided by financing activities for 2014  reflected net proceeds from borrowings on longterm debt of 295 million  compared with net payments on longterm debt of 50 million  for 2013 and net proceeds from borrowings of 2292 million  for 2012 in addition in december 2014 the company issued 1250 million  of senior unsecured notes which consisted of 300 million  of 261  senior unsecured notes due december 2019 and 950 million  of 309  senior unsecured notes due december 2021 fiscal years 2014  2013  and 2012  reflect proceeds from the exercise of stock options of 183 million  121 million  and 199 million  respectively fiscal years 2014  2013  and 2012  included 62 million  54 million  and 84 million  respectively in excess tax benefits related to stockbased compensation cash provided by financing activities for 2014 also reflected the repurchase of common stock for 1466 million 

total debt at december 28 2014  includes 3750 million  outstanding in senior notes 2000 million  in term loans 1050 million  outstanding under the 7500 million credit facility and 147 million  in other debt the company also has 104 million  outstanding under capital leases of which 13 million  is current 

in october 2011 our board of directors approved a stock repurchase program “2011 repurchase program” authorizing the company to repurchase up to 2500000 shares of its common stock shares may be repurchased from time to time in open market transactions at prevailing market prices or in privately negotiated transactions in 2011 teledyne repurchased 658562 shares of teledyne common stock for 349 million under the 2011 repurchase program no repurchases were made in 2013 or 2012 as part of the 2011 repurchase program in september 2014 the company entered into a 1016 million accelerated share repurchase “asr” agreement with a financial institution “asr counterparty” in a privately negotiated transaction for 1030000 shares of the company’s common stock at an initial price of 9862 per share pursuant to the asr agreement in september 2014 the company advanced 1016 million to the asr counterparty and received 927000 shares of common stock which used 914 million of the 1016 million advanced representing 90 of the estimated shares to be repurchased under the asr agreement the upfront payment was accounted for as a reduction to stockholders’ equity in the company’s condensed consolidated balance sheet in the period the payment was made the total number of shares of common stock that the company will repurchase under the asr will be based on the average of the daily volumeweighted average prices of the common stock during the term of the asr less a discount at settlement the asr counterparty may be required to deliver additional shares of the company’s common stock to the company or under certain circumstances the company may be required to deliver shares of its common stock or make a cash payment to the asr counterparty final settlement of the asr agreement is expected to occur in june 2015 although the settlement may be accelerated at the asr counterparty’s option the company has treated the asr as a treasury share repurchase of common stock in the period the shares are delivered for purposes of calculating earnings per share and as a forward contract indexed to its own common stock the asr meets all of the applicable criteria for equity classification and therefore is not accounted for as a derivative instrument 

in 2014 the company spent 1466 million which includes 1016 million advanced under the asr agreement to repurchase a total of 1396290 shares of its common stock at an average price 9770 per share common stock teledyne issues shares for sharebased compensation plans from treasury stock teledyne had 1042281 shares of treasury stock at december 28 2014 at december 28 2014 342148 shares remain available for repurchase under the 2011 repurchase program 

on january 27 2015 teledyne’s board of directors approved an additional stock repurchase program authorizing the company to repurchase up to an additional 2500000 shares of its common stock “2015 repurchase program” noting that 342148 shares remain available for repurchase under the 2011 repurchase program as part of the 2015 repurchase program on february 2 2015 the company entered into a 1420 million asr agreement with a financial institution in a privately negotiated transaction for 1500000 shares of the companys common stock at an initial price of 9468 per share pursuant to the asr agreement in february 2015 the company advanced 1420 million to the asr counterparty and received 1425000 shares of common stock which used 1349 million of the 1420 million advanced representing 95 of the estimated shares to be repurchased under the asr agreement the asr was funded by cash on hand and floating rate borrowings of 1200 million under the 750 million credit facility the 2011 and 2015 repurchase programs are expected to remain open continuously and the number of shares purchased will depend on a variety of factors such as share price levels of cash and borrowing capacity available alternative investment opportunities available immediately or longerterm and other regulatory market or economic conditions future repurchases would be funded with cash on hand and borrowings under the company’s credit facility 

  pension plans 

teledyne has a domestic defined benefit pension plan covering substantially all us employees hired before january 1 2004 or approximately 18  of teledyne’s active employees as of january 1 2004 new hires participate in a defined contribution plan in 2014 teledyne’s domestic pension plan was over 100 funded thus no cash contribution was made in 2013 teledyne made a voluntary pretax contribution to its domestic qualified pension plan of 830 million before recovery from the us government in 2012 teledyne made pretax cash contributions of approximately 928 million to its domestic pension plan before recovery from the us government in connection with recent acquisitions the company assumed 

responsibility for a several defined benefit pension plans based in the united kingdom switzerland and the netherlands covering approximately 520 participants in total for the company’s domestic pension plan the discount rate for 2015 will decrease to 45 from 54 in 2014 

other matters 

income taxes 

our income tax expense deferred tax assets and liabilities and reserves for unrecognized tax benefits reflect management’s best assessment of estimated current and future taxes to be paid we are subject to income taxes in both the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions significant judgments and estimates are required in determining the consolidated income tax expense 

the company’s effective tax rate for 2014  was 236  compared with 177  for 2013  and 287  for 2012  fiscal years 2014  2013  and 2012  included net discrete tax benefits of 89 million  213 million  and 54 million  respectively these relate primarily to the remeasurement of uncertain tax positions including expirations of the statute of limitations and the favorable resolution of a tax matter excluding these items the company’s effective tax rates for fiscal years 2014  2013  and 2012  would have been 267  271  and 310  respectively total year 2014 also included 56 million in federal research and development tax credits the lower 2013 effective tax rate compared with the 2012 effective tax rate excluding the net discrete tax benefits primarily reflected increased federal tax credits for research and development a lower state effective tax rate and a change in the portion of foreign and domestic income based on the company’s history of operating earnings expectations of future operating earnings and potential tax planning strategies management believes that it is possible that some portion of deferred taxes will not be realized as a future tax benefit and therefore has recorded a valuation allowance deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amount in the financial statements which will result in taxable or deductible amounts in the future in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets within the jurisdiction from which they arise we consider all available positive and negative evidence including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities projected future taxable income taxplanning strategies and results of recent operations in projecting future taxable income we begin with historical results adjusted for the results of discontinued operations and incorporate assumptions about the amount of future state federal and foreign pretax operating income adjusted for items that do not have tax consequences the assumptions about future taxable income require significant judgment and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses in evaluating the objective evidence that historical results provide we consider three years of cumulative operating income 

we file income tax returns in the united states federal jurisdiction and in various states and foreign jurisdictions the company has substantially concluded on all us federal income tax matters for all years through 2010 california income tax matters for all years through 2009 and canadian income tax matters for all years through 2006 the company does not believe that the resolution of any of the audits will have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations an appeal filed with a state tax authority for the 2011 tax year if resolved favorably could reduce income tax expense up to 10 million substantially all other material state local and foreign income tax matters have been concluded for years through 2009 

costs and pricing 

inflationary trends in recent years have been moderate current inventory costs the increasing costs of equipment and other costs are considered in establishing sales pricing policies the company emphasizes cost containment in all aspects of its business 

hedging activities market risk disclosures 

teledyne transacts business in various foreign currencies and has international sales and expenses denominated in foreign currencies subjecting the company to foreign currency risk the company’s primary objective is to protect the united states dollar value of future cash flows and minimize the volatility of reported earnings following the acquisition of dalsa the company began to utilize foreign currency forward contracts to reduce the volatility of cash flows primarily related to forecasted revenue and expenses denominated in canadian dollars these contracts are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges 

the effectiveness of the cash flow hedge contracts excluding time value is assessed prospectively and retrospectively on a monthly basis using regression analysis as well as using other timing and probability criteria to receive hedge accounting treatment all hedging relationships are formally documented at the inception of the hedges and must be highly effective in offsetting changes to future cash flows on hedged transactions the effective portion of the cash flow hedge contracts’ gains or losses resulting from changes in the fair value of these hedges is initially reported net of tax as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income  “ aoci ”  in stockholders’ equity until the underlying hedged item is reflected in our consolidated statements of income at which time the effective amount in accumulated other comprehensive income is reclassified to cost of sales in our consolidated statements of income the company expects to reclassify a loss of 

approximately 29 million net of tax over the next 12 months based on the yearend 2014 exchange rate 

in the event that the gains or losses in aoci are deemed to be ineffective the ineffective portion of gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value if any is reclassified to other income and expense in the event that the underlying forecasted transactions do not occur or it becomes remote that they will occur within the defined hedge period the gains or losses on the related cash flow hedges will be reclassified from aoci to other income and expense during the current reporting period all forecasted transactions occurred and therefore there were no such gains or losses reclassified to other income and expense as of december 28 2014  teledyne had foreign currency forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges to buy canadian dollars and to sell us dollars totaling 763 million  and these contracts had a negative fair value of 39 million  these foreign currency forward contracts have maturities ranging from march 2015 to june 2016 

in addition the company utilizes foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate foreign exchange rate risk associated with foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities including intercompany receivables and payables as of december 28 2014  teledyne had foreign currency contracts of this type in the following currency pairs in millions 



these contracts had a negative fair value of 45 million  at december 28 2014  the gains and losses on these derivatives which are not designated as hedging instruments under asc 815 derivatives and hedging are intended to at a minimum partially offset the transaction gains and losses recognized in earnings all derivatives are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value as discussed below the accounting for gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value depends on the use of the derivative and whether it is designated and qualifies for hedge accounting teledyne does not use foreign currency forward contracts for speculative or trading purposes 

notwithstanding our efforts to mitigate portions of our foreign currency exchange rate risks there can be no assurance that our hedging activities will adequately protect us against the risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations a hypothetical 10 appreciation of the us dollar from its value at december 28 2014  would decrease the fair value of our foreign currency forward contracts associated with our cash flow hedging activities by 76 million  a hypothetical 10 depreciation of the us dollar from its value at december 28 2014  would increase the fair value of our foreign currency forward contracts associated with our cash flow hedging activities by 76 million  

borrowings under our credit facility are at fixed rates that vary with the term and timing of each loan under the facility loans under the facility typically have terms of one two three or six months and the interest rate for each such loan is subject to change if the loan is continued or converted following the applicable maturity date interest rates are also subject to change based on our debt to earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization ratio as of december 28 2014  we had 1050 million  outstanding indebtedness under our 7500 million credit facility any borrowings under the company’s revolving credit line are based on a fluctuating market interest rate and consequently the fair value of any outstanding debt should not be affected materially by changes in market interest rates a 100 basis point increase in interest rates would result in an increase in annual interest expense of approximately 11 million  assuming the 1050 million  in debt was outstanding for the full year 

we believe that adequate controls are in place to monitor any hedging activities our primary exposure to market risk relates to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates we periodically evaluate these risks and have taken measures to mitigate these risks we own assets and operate facilities in countries that have been politically stable

environmental 

we are subject to various federal state local and international environmental laws and regulations which require that we investigate and remediate the effects of the release or disposal of materials at sites associated with past and present operations these include sites at which teledyne has been identified as a potentially responsible party under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act commonly known as superfund and comparable state laws we are currently involved in the investigation and remediation of a number of sites reserves for environmental investigation and remediation totaled 97 million  at december 28 2014  and 91 million  at december 29 2013  as investigation and remediation of these sites proceed and new information is received the company expects that accruals will be adjusted to reflect new information based on current information we do not believe that future environmental costs in excess of those already accrued will materially and adversely affect our financial condition or liquidity however resolution of one or more of these environmental matters or future accrual adjustments in any one reporting period could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations for that period see also our environmental risk factor disclosure beginning at page 22 

for additional discussion of environmental matters see notes 2 and 15 to the notes to consolidated financial statements 

government contracts 

we perform work on a number of contracts with the us department of defense and other agencies and departments of the us government including subcontracts with government prime contractors sales under these contracts with the us government which included contracts with the us department of defense were approximately 25  of total sales in 2014  27  of total sales in 2013  and 32  of total sales in 2012  for a summary of sales to the us government by segment see note 13 to the notes to consolidated financial statements sales to the us department of defense represented approximately 20  21  and 26  of total sales for 2014  2013  and 2012  respectively see also our government contracts risks factor disclosure beginning at page 16 

performance under government contracts has certain inherent risks that could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business results of operations and financial condition government contracts are conditioned upon the continuing availability of congressional appropriations which usually occurs on a fiscal year basis even though contract performance may take more than one year 

for information on accounts receivable from the us government see note 5 to the notes to consolidated financial statements 

estimates and reserves 

our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent liabilities on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including those related to product returns and replacements allowance for doubtful accounts inventories intangible assets income taxes warranty obligations pension and other postretirement benefits longterm contracts environmental workers’ compensation and general liability employee dental and medical benefits and other contingencies and litigation we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances at the time the results of which form the basis for making our judgments actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions in some cases such differences may be material see “other matters  critical accounting policies” 

the following table reflects significant reserves and valuation accounts which are estimates and based on judgments as described above at december 28 2014  and december 29 2013  in millions 

reserves and valuation accounts a 

  

a this table should be read in conjunction with the notes to consolidated financial statements 

b includes both longterm and shortterm reserves 

some of the company’s products are subject to specified warranties and the company provides for the estimated cost of product warranties we regularly assess the adequacy of our preexisting warranty liabilities and adjust amounts as necessary based on a review of historic warranty experience with respect to the applicable business or products as well as the length and actual terms of the warranties which are typically one year the product warranty reserve is included in current accrued liabilities and other longterm liabilities on the balance sheet changes in the company’s product warranty reserve are as follows in millions 



critical accounting policies 

the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with united states generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the notes to the financial statements some of those judgments can be subjective and complex and therefore actual results could differ materially from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions our critical accounting policies are those that are reflective of significant judgment complexity and uncertainty and may potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions we have identified the following as critical accounting policies revenue recognition accounting for pension plans accounting for business combinations goodwill and other longlived assets and accounting for income taxes for additional discussion of the application of these and other accounting policies see note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition 

revenue is recognized when the earnings process is substantially complete and all of the following criteria are met 1 persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists 2 delivery has occurred or services have been rendered 3 our price to our customer is fixed or determinable and 4 collectability is reasonably assured 

we determine the appropriate method by which we recognize revenue by analyzing the terms and conditions of our contracts or arrangements entered into with our customers the majority of our revenue is recognized on certain product sales upon shipment to the customer at fixed or determinable prices and with a reasonable assurance of collection passage of title to the customer and fulfillment of all significant obligations revenue is recognized net of estimated sales returns and other allowances the remaining revenue is generally associated with longterm contracts to design develop and manufacture highly engineered products used in commercial or defense applications such contracts are generally accounted for using contract accounting percentageofcompletion “poc” method 

the company’s standard terms of sale are fob shipping point for a small percentage of sales where title and risk of loss passes at destination point and assuming all other criteria for revenue recognition are met the company recognizes revenue after delivery to the customer if any significant obligation to the customer with respect to a sales transaction remains following shipment revenue recognition is deferred until such obligations have been fulfilled in general our revenue arrangements do not involve acceptance provisions based on customer specified acceptance criteria in those circumstances when customer specified acceptance criteria exist and if we cannot demonstrate that the system meets those specifications prior to the shipment then revenue is deferred until customer acceptance is obtained the company does not offer substantial sales incentives and credits to customers 

we have a few contracts that require the company to warehouse certain goods for which revenue is recognized when all risks of loss is borne by the customer and all other criteria for revenue recognition are met 

we also have a small number of multiple elements arrangements ie free product training installation additional parts etc if contract accounting does not apply we allocate the contract price among the deliverables based on vendorspecific objective evidence of fair value to each element in the arrangement if objective and reliable evidence of fair value of any element is not available we use our best estimate of selling price for purposes of allocating the total arrangement consideration among the elements also extended or noncustomary warranties do not represent a significant portion of our revenue however when our revenue arrangements include an extended or noncustomary warranty provision the revenue is deferred and recognized ratably over the extended warranty period 

contracts that require substantial performance over a long time period generally one or more years revenues are recorded under the poc method we record net revenue and an estimated profit as work on our contracts progresses the poc method for these contracts is dependent on the nature of the contract or products provided depending on the contract we may measure the extent of progress toward completion using the unitsofdelivery method costtocost method or upon attainment of scheduled performance contract milestones which could be time event or expense driven for example for costreimbursable contracts we use the costtocost method to measure progress toward completion under the costtocost method of accounting we recognize revenue and an estimated profit as allowable costs are incurred based on the proportion that the incurred costs bear to total estimated costs another example for contracts that require us to provide a substantial number of similar items we record revenue and an estimated profit on a poc basis using unitsofdelivery as the basis to measure progress toward completing the contract occasionally it is appropriate to combine individual customer orders and treat them as one arrangement when the underlying agreement was reached with the customer for a single large project 

 the percentage of company revenue recognized using the poc method was 287  in 2014  321  in 2013  and 367  in 2012  

accounting for contracts using the poc method requires management judgment relative to assessing risks estimating contract revenue and cost and making assumptions for schedule and technical issues contract revenue may include estimated amounts not contractually agreed to by the customer including price redetermination cost or performance incentives such as award and incentives fees unpriced change orders claims and requests for equitable adjustment the poc method requires management’s judgment to make reasonably dependable cost estimates generally over a long time period since certain contracts extend over a long period of time the impact of revisions in cost and revenue estimates during the progress of work may adjust the current period earnings on a cumulative catchup basis this method recognizes in the current period the cumulative effect of the changes on current and prior quarters additionally if the current contract estimate indicates a loss a provision is made for the total anticipated loss in the period that it becomes evident contract cost and revenue estimates for significant contracts are generally reviewed and reassessed at least quarterly 

the net effect of the favorable and unfavorable changes in estimates were expense of 30 million  in 2014  18 million  in 2013  and 12 million  in 2012  the gross aggregate effects of these favorable and unfavorable changes in estimates in 2014  2013  and 2012  were 229 million  214 million  and 180 million  of favorable operating income and 259 million  232 million  and 192 million  of unfavorable operating income respectively we do not believe that any discrete event or 

adjustment to an individual contract within the aggregate changes in contract estimates for 2014  2013  or 2012  was material to the consolidated statements of income for such annual periods 

accounting for pension plans 

teledyne has a defined benefit pension plan covering substantially all us employees hired before january 1 2004 or approximately 18  of teledyne’s active employees as of january 1 2004 new hires participate in a defined contribution plan in connection with recent acquisitions the company assumed responsibility for several smaller foreignbased benefit pension plans at december 28 2014 the benefit obligation for the domestic defined benefit pension plan totaled 8784 million and the fair value of the net plan assets were 9574 million at december 28 2014 the benefit obligation for the foreignbased pension plans totaled 610 million and the fair value of the net plan assets were 477 million the company’s accounting for its defined benefit pension plan requires that amounts recognized in financial statements be determined on an actuarial basis rather than as contributions are made to the plan in consultation with our actuaries we determine the appropriate assumptions for use in determining the liability for future pension benefits significant assumptions used in determining the company’s pension income or expense is the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets participant mortality estimates expected rates of increase in future compensation levels employee turnover as well as the assumed discount rate on pension obligations the company has assumed based upon the types of securities the plan assets are invested in and the longterm historical returns of these investments that the longterm expected return on pension assets will be 825  in 2015 for its domestic pension plan and the assumed discount rate will be 45  in 2015 for its domestic pension plan the company’s longterm expected return on pension assets used in 2014  was 825 for its domestic pension plans and the assumed discount rate used in 2014  was 54  the actual rate of return on pension assets was 54   in 2014  and 196 in 2013  for its domestic pension plan if the actual rate of return on pension assets is below the projection the company may be required to make additional contributions to the pension trust at december 28 2014 the domestic plan is overfunded and contributions are not required the company did not make any cash contributions to its domestic pension benefit plan in 2014  and made a voluntary pretax cash contribution of 830 million  in 2013  before recovery from the us government recently the society of actuaries released revised mortality tables which update life expectancy assumptions in consideration of these tables we modified the mortality assumptions used in determining our pension and postretirement benefit obligations as of december 28 2014 the impact of these new mortality assumptions has resulted in an increase to our pension obligation and an increase in future pension expense our plan remains overfunded after the impact of the new mortality assumptions as well as from changes to other relevant assumptions at yearend 2014  the company has a 2293 million  noncash reduction to stockholders’ equity and a longterm additional liability of 3654 million  related to its pension plans at yearend 2013  the company had a 1332 million  noncash reduction to stockholders’ equity and a longterm additional liability of 2140 million  related to its pension plans see note 12 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional pension disclosures 

differences in the discount rate and expected longterm rate of return on assets within the indicated range would have had the following impact on 2014  pension expense in millions 

see note 12 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional pension disclosures 

accounting for business combinations goodwill acquired intangible assets and other longlived assets 

the results for all acquisitions are included in the company’s consolidated financial statements from the date of each respective acquisition business acquisitions are accounted for under the purchase method by assigning the purchase price to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at their fair values and the excess of the purchase price over the amounts assigned is recorded as goodwill we determine the fair value of such assets and liabilities generally in consultation with thirdparty valuation advisors purchased intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives adjustments to fair value assessments are recorded to goodwill over the purchase price allocation period 

goodwill and acquired intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized we review goodwill and acquired indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable the company also performs an annual impairment test in the fourth quarter of each year we would test goodwill and acquired indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment between annual tests if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce our enterprise fair value below its book value these events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate including a significant sustained decline in an entity’s market value legal factors operating performance indicators competition sale or disposition of a significant 

portion of the business or other factors based on a quarterly impairment test completed in 2014  the company recorded a 07 million impairment to acquired intangible assets based on the annual impairment test completed in the fourth quarter of 2013 the company recorded a 12 million impairment to acquired intangible assets no impairment of goodwill was indicated in 2014 or 2013 based on the annual impairment test completed in the fourth quarter of each year 

for goodwill impairment testing the company estimates the fair value of the reporting units using a discounted cash flow model based on our best estimate of amounts and timing of future revenues and cash flows and our most recent business and strategic plans and compares the estimated fair value to the carrying value of the reporting unit including goodwill the discounted cash flow model requires judgmental assumptions about projected revenue growth future operating margins discount rates and terminal values over a multiyear period there are inherent uncertainties related to these assumptions and managements judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill impairment while the company believes it has made reasonable estimates and assumptions to calculate the fair value of its reporting units it is possible a material change could occur if actual results are not consistent with management’s estimates and assumptions goodwill may be overstated and a charge would need to be taken against net earnings 

as of december 28 2014  the company had 26 reporting units for goodwill impairment testing the carrying value of goodwill included in the company’s individual reporting units ranges from 09 million to 2751 million the company’s analysis in 2014 indicated that in all instances the fair value of the company’s reporting units exceeded their carrying values and consequently did not result in an impairment charge the excess of the estimated fair value over the carrying value expressed as a percentage of carrying value of the respective reporting unit for each of the company’s reporting units as of the fourth quarter of 2014 the annual testing date ranged from approximately 57 to 5670 

changes in these projections could affect the estimated fair value of certain of the company’s reporting units and could result in a goodwill impairment charge in a future period in order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations used in the goodwill impairment test the company applied a hypothetical 10 decrease to the fair values of each reporting unit and compared those values to the reporting unit carrying values based on this sensitivity analysis the company did not identify any goodwill impairment due to the many variables inherent in the estimation of a reporting unit’s fair value and the relative size of our recorded goodwill differences in assumptions may have a material effect on the results of our impairment analysis 

the impairment test for indefinitelived intangibles other than goodwill primarily trademarks and trade names consists of a comparison of the fair value of the indefinitelived intangible asset to the carrying value of the asset as of the impairment testing date the company estimates the fair value of its indefinitelived intangibles using a discounted cash flow model based on our best estimate of amounts and timing of future revenues and cash flows and our most recent business and strategic plans and compares the estimated fair value to the carrying value of the asset the estimated fair values exceed the carrying value for each of the company’s indefinitelived intangible assets as of the fourth quarter of 2014  the annual testing date 

accounting for income taxes 

income tax expense and deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect management’s assessment of actual future taxes to be paid on items reflected in the financial statements significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes uncertainty exists regarding tax positions taken in previously filed tax returns still under examination and positions expected to be taken in the current year and future returns deferred tax assets and liabilities arise due to differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and tax carryforwards although we believe our income tax expense and deferred tax assets and liabilities are reasonable no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome will not be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals to the extent that the final tax outcome is different than the amounts recorded such differences will impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made the provision for income taxes includes the impact of uncertain tax benefits that are considered appropriate as well as the related net interest 

significant judgment is required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets in assessing the need for a valuation allowance we consider all available evidence including past operating results estimates of future taxable income and the feasibility of tax planning strategies in the event that we change our determination as to the amount of deferred tax assets that can be realized we will adjust our valuation allowance with a corresponding impact to the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made 

we record uncertain tax benefits on the basis of a twostep process whereby 1 we determine whether it is more likely than not that the tax positions will be sustained on the basis of the technical merits of the position and 2 for those tax positions that meet the “morelikelythannot” recognition threshold we recognize the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50 percent likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement with the related tax authority 

an increase of 1 in our nominal tax rate would have resulted in additional income tax provision from continuing operations for the fiscal year ended december 28 2014 of 28 million for a description of the company’s tax accounting policies refer to note 2 and note 11 to the company’s consolidated financial statements 

recent accounting pronouncements 

effective december 30 2013 the first day of our 2014 fiscal year the company adopted accounting guidance related to the presentation of an unrecognized tax benefit when a net operating loss carryforward  “nol”  a similar tax loss or a tax credit carryforward exists under the guidance an entity will be required to present an unrecognized tax benefit as a reduction of a deferred tax asset for a nol or tax credit carryforward whenever the nol or tax credit carryforward would be available to reduce the additional taxable income or tax due if the tax position is disallowed the companys adoption of the guidance did not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements 

in may 2014 the financial accounting standards board issued accounting standards update no 201409 revenue from contracts with customers which provides a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and will supersede most current revenue recognition guidance this new guidance is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after december 15 2016 and can be adopted either retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented or as a cumulativeeffect adjustment as of the date of adoption with early application not permitted the company is currently in the process of determining its implementation approach and assessing the impact on the consolidated financial statements and footnote disclosures

we lead and support air and missile defense programs including the objective simulation framework “osf” and test execution services and launch augmentation programs “testla” as the missile defense agency “mda” prime contractor for the osf contract we design develop test implement and maintain the osf the osf is being designed to support full scale simulations ground tests and live fire events throughout the life cycle of the ballistic missile defense system under the 2013awarded testla contract we will continue development manufacturing and integration of advanced technology solutions in support of the warfighter 

we specialize in marine systems design and manufacturing for the us special operations command we are the prime contractor engaged to design develop test manufacture and sustain the shallow water command submersible “swcs” vehicle to replace the current seal delivery vehicle with the design of the swcs vehicle nearing completion we expect to begin the manufacturing and test phase in 2014 we are producing the littoral battlespace sensing glider “lbsg” system for the us navy program executive office  command control computer and intelligence “peoc4i” teledyne webb research is the glider developer and manufacturer on the lbsg program we manufacture gun mounts for the littoral combat ship program most recently outfitting the uss freedom under contract to raytheon company we continue to manufacture advanced mine detection and neutralization systems 

we are active in us space programs and continue to play a vital role in the science operations area of the international space station “iss” program we provide 24hourperday payload operations in the iss payload operations and integration center located at nasa’s marshall space flight center in 2012 nasa awarded us a cooperative agreement to foster the commercial utilization of the iss under this agreement we continue to work to develop a commercial earth imaging platform known as the multiuser system for earth imaging “muses” we also design develop and manufacture components for liquid rocket engines scientific payloads and manned space vehicles 

we operate a full service radiological analysis laboratory in knoxville tennessee while this laboratory principally supports nuclear power plants in united states most recently it broadened its services to cover the mining and ore industry we also manage and operate a separation purification and analysis of atmospheric samples laboratory for the us government additionally we provide engineering and manufacturing for customers in the commercial nuclear market 

extending our historic facilities and plant management services to the commercial arena in november 2012 we were awarded a threeyear lab and office facility management contract for research services from the dow chemical company we are currently leading onsite and offsite management and support research services at three dow chemical research facilities 

we manufacture products that are primarily highly engineered and high quality machined and metal fabricated components and assemblies for external customers across the spectrum of our core business base including nasa us department of defense customers and the us department of energy as well as commercial customers through our ukbased operations we manufacture advanced composites for the commercial aviation industry 

energy systems 

we manufacture hydrogenoxygen gas generators used worldwide in electrical power generation plants semiconductor manufacturing optical fiber production chemical processing specialty metals float glass and other industrial processes our sales of hydrogen generators have been primarily in developing countries and domestic applications where delivered merchant gas is not practical we also provide thermoelectric and electrochemical energy technology solutions for use in us government programs 

turbine engines 

we design develop and manufacture small turbine engines primarily used in tactical missiles for military markets our engines power the boeing harpoon and standoff land attack missile systems and we are the sole source provider of engines for the baseline lockheed martin joint airtosurface standoff missile “jassm” we also continue to work on advanced technology for small turbine engines and components for programs sponsored by the us air force research laboratory 

customers 

we have hundreds of customers in the various industries we serve no commercial customer accounted for more than 10 of our total sales nor more than 10 of any segment sales during 2013  2012  or 2011  our largest commercial customer a customer of our instrumentation segment accounted for 36  34  and 29  of total sales in 2013  2012  and 2011  respectively 

sales to international customers accounted for approximately 44  of total sales in 2013  compared with 39  in 2012  and 36  in 2011  in 2013  we sold products to customers in over 100 foreign countries approximately 90 of our sales to foreign customers were made to customers in 22 foreign countries the 2013  top five countries for international sales were the united kingdom  norway  china  germany  and south korea  and constituted approximately 23  of our total sales 

approximately 27  32  and 36  of our total sales for 2013  2012  and 2011  respectively were derived from contracts with agencies of and prime contractors to the us government information on our sales to the us government including direct sales as a prime contractor and indirect sales as a subcontractor is as follows in millions 



our principal us government customer is the us department of defense these sales represented 21  26  and 29  of our total sales for 2013  2012  and 2011  respectively in 2013 our largest program with the us government was the objective simulation framework contract with the missile defense agency which represented 14 of our total sales in both 2012  and 2011  our largest program with the us government was the systems development and operations support contract with nasa’s marshall space flight center which represented 19 of our total sales in both years 

as described under risk factors there are risks associated with doing business with the us government in 2013  approximately 60  of our us government prime contracts and subcontracts were fixedprice type contracts compared to 59  in 2012  and 60  in 2011  under these types of contracts we bear the inherent risk that actual performance cost may exceed the fixed contract price such contracts are typically not subject to renegotiation of profits if we fail to anticipate technical problems estimate costs accurately or control costs during performance additionally us government contracts are subject to termination by the us government at its convenience without identification of any default when contracts are terminated for convenience we typically recover costs incurred or committed settlement expenses and profit on work completed prior to termination we had four  us government contracts terminated for convenience in 2013  compared to six  in 2012  and seven  in 2011  

our total backlog of confirmed orders was approximately 9412 million  at december 29 2013  compared with 9525 million  at december 30 2012  and 9446 million  at january 1 2012  we expect to fulfill 99  of such backlog of confirmed orders during 2014  

raw materials and suppliers 

generally our businesses have experienced minimal fluctuations in the supply of raw materials but not without some price volatility while some of our businesses provide services for those businesses that sell hardware and product a portion of the value that we provide is labor oriented such as design engineering assembly and test activities in manufacturing our products we use our own production capabilities and also third party suppliers and subcontractors including international sources some of the items we purchase for the manufacture of our products including certain gyro components for some marine navigation applications certain magnets and helix wire for our traveling wave tubes and certain infrared detectors substrates as well as certain scintillator materials use in the production of our xray detectors are purchased from limited or single sources including international sources due to technical capability price and other factors while over the years we have not experienced much difficulty in procuring raw materials components subassemblies and other supplies required in our manufacturing processes disruption in the global economy and financial markets could trigger increased pricing and otherwise affect our suppliers as well as our ability to procure some supplies 

sales and marketing 

our sales and marketing approach varies by segment and by products within our segments a shared fundamental tenet is the commitment to work closely with our customers to understand their needs with an aim to secure preferred supplier and longerterm relationships 

our segments use a combination of internal sales forces distributors and commissioned sales representatives to market and sell our products and services our teledyne instruments companies and other businesses have been working over the years to consolidate or share internal sales and servicing efforts several teledyne businesses have been marketing and selling products collaboratively to similar customers to promote “onestop” shopping under singular “brand” names including teledyne oil  gas teledyne marine teledyne nuclear teledyne water quality and teledyne microwave solutions 

products are also advertised in appropriate trade journals and by means of various websites to promote our products and other capabilities our personnel regularly participate in relevant trade shows and professional associations 

many of our government contracts are awarded after a competitive bidding process in which we seek to emphasize our ability to provide superior products and technical solutions in addition to competitive pricing 

through teledyne technologies international corp and other subsidiaries the company has established offices in foreign countries to facilitate international sales for various businesses locations include brazil china france germany italy japan malaysia singapore south korea switzerland and the united arab emirates 

competition 

we believe that technological capabilities and innovation and the ability to invest in the development of new and enhanced products are critical to obtaining and maintaining leadership in our markets and the industries in which we compete although we have certain advantages that we believe help us compete effectively in our markets each of our markets is highly competitive because of the diversity of products sold and the number of markets we serve we encounter a wide variety of competitors our businesses vigorously compete on the basis of quality product performance and reliability technical expertise price and service many of our competitors have and potential competitors could have greater name recognition a larger installed base of products more extensive engineering manufacturing marketing and distribution capabilities and greater financial technological and personnel resources than we do 

  research and development 

our research and development efforts primarily involve engineering and design related to improving products and developing new products and technologies in the same or similar fields we spent a total of 3882 million  in 2013  3642 million  in 2012  and 3157 million  in 2011  on research and development and bid and proposal costs customerfunded research and development most of which was attributable to work under contracts with the us government represented approximately 57  of total research and development costs for 2013  compared with 64  in 2012  and 68  in 2011  

in 2013  we incurred 1670 million  in companyfunded research and development and bid and proposal costs we expect the level of companyfunded research and development and bid and proposal costs to be approximately 1742 million  in 2014  

intellectual property 

while we own and control various intellectual property rights including patents trade secrets confidential information trademarks trade names and copyrights which in the aggregate are of material importance to our business we believe that our business as a whole is not materially dependent upon any one intellectual property or related group of such properties we own several hundred active patents and are licensed to use certain patents technology and other intellectual property rights owned and controlled by others similarly other companies are licensed to use certain patents technology and other intellectual property rights owned and controlled by us 

patents patent applications and license agreements will expire or terminate over time by operation of law in accordance with their terms or otherwise we do not expect the expiration or termination of these patents patent applications and license agreements to have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

employees 

we consider our relations with our employees to be good at december 29 2013 our total workforce consisted of approximately 9600  employees of which approximately 7140  employees were located in the united states 

executive management

risk factors cautionary statement as to forwardlooking statements 

the following text highlights various risks and uncertainties associated with teledyne these factors could materially affect “forwardlooking statements” within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 that we may make from time to time including forwardlooking statements contained in “item 1 business” and “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” of this form 10k and in teledyne’s 2013  annual report to stockholders it is not possible for management to predict all such factors and new factors may emerge additionally management cannot assess the impact of each such factor on teledyne or the extent to which any factor or combination of factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forwardlooking statements 

  

a new global recession continued economic uncertainty in europe or an economic downturn in china may adversely affect us 

if another global recession emerges if economic uncertainty in europe continues or worsens or if economic growth in china substantially slows we may experience declines in revenues profitability and cash flows from reduced orders payment delays collection difficulties increased price pressures for our products increased risk of excess and obsolete inventories or other factors caused by the economic problems of customers if negative conditions in the global credit markets prevent our customers’ access to credit or render them insolvent orders for our products may decrease which would result in lower revenue likewise if our suppliers face challenges in obtaining credit in selling their products or otherwise in operating their businesses or remaining solvent they may become unable to offer the materials we use to manufacture our products these events could adversely impact our ability to manufacture affected products and could also result in reductions in our revenue increased price competition and increased operating costs which could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we develop and manufacture products for customers in the energy exploration and production markets domestic and international commercial aerospace markets the semiconductor industry the consumer electronics and automotive industries each of which has been cyclical and suffered from fluctuating market demands a cyclical downturn in these markets may materially affect future operating results 

in addition we sell products and services to customers in industries that are sensitive to the level of general economic activity and consumer spending habits and in more mature industries that are sensitive to capacity adverse economic conditions affecting these industries may reduce demand for our products and services which may reduce our revenues profits or production levels some of our businesses serve industries such as power generation and petrochemical refining which may be negatively impacted by reductions in global capital expenditures and manufacturing capacity 

united states and global responses to terrorism the winding down of war in afghanistan continuing turmoil in middle eastern countries concerns regarding nuclear proliferation and the safety of nuclear energy potential epidemics financial issues facing airlines and volatile energy prices increase uncertainties with respect to many of our businesses and may adversely affect our business and results of operations 

united states’ and global responses to terrorism the winding down of war in afghanistan continuing turmoil in middle eastern countries and nuclear proliferation concerns increase uncertainties with respect to us and other business and financial markets and could adversely affect our business and operations 

air travel declines have occurred after terrorist attacks and heightened security alerts as well as after the h1n1 virus sars and bird flu scares while travel by our sales and service personnel to various regions has been affected by such factors additional declines in air travel resulting from such factors and other factors could adversely affect the financial condition of many of our commercial airline and aircraft manufacturer customers and in turn could adversely affect our aerospace and defense electronics segment in addition a prolonged virus epidemic or pandemic or the threat thereof could result in worker absences lower productivity voluntary closure of our offices and manufacturing facilities disruptions in our supply chain travel restrictions on our employees and other disruptions to our businesses moreover health epidemics may force local health and government authorities to mandate the temporary closure of our offices and manufacturing facilities 

deterioration of financial performance of airlines could result in a reduction of discretionary spending for upgrades of avionics and inflight communications equipment which would adversely affect our aerospace and defense electronics segment 

higher oil prices could adversely affect commercial airlinerelated customers of our aerospace and defense electronics segment conversely lower oil prices could decrease oil exploration and petrochemical refining activities and hinder our 

marine and other instrumentation businesses in addition instability in the middle east or other oilproducing regions could adversely affect expansion plans of the oil and gas industry customers of our instrumentation and cable solutions businesses 

acquisitions involve inherent risks that may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

our growth strategy includes acquisitions acquisitions involve various inherent risks such as 

 • the potential loss of key personnel of an acquired business 

 • the distraction of management resulting from the need to integrate acquired businesses 

• increased competition for acquisition targets which may increase acquisition costs 

• the potential impairment of assets 

• potential unknown liabilities associated with a business we acquire or in which we invest 

 • production delays associated with consolidating acquired facilities and manufacturing operations 

 • unanticipated changes in business and economic conditions affecting an acquired business 

  

while we conduct financial and other due diligence in connection with our acquisitions and generally seek some form of protection including indemnification from a seller and sometimes an escrow of a portion of the purchase price to cover potential issues such acquired companies may have weaknesses or liabilities that are not accurately assessed or brought to our attention at the time of the acquisition further indemnities or escrows may not fully cover such matters particularly matters identified after a closing 

as they have over the last few years acquisitions may also change the nature and level of various risks faced by teledyne for example the dalsa acquisition in 2011 and the lecroy acquisition in 2012 increased the percentage of sales attributable to commercial customers as opposed to the us government these acquisitions coupled with our acquisitions of additional canadabased companies optech and varisystems and ukbased pdmneptec in 2012 and also our 2013 acquisitions of denmarkbased reson ukbased cdl and netherlandsbased axiom also increased the percentage of revenues and expenses that arise from international sources and consequently our exposure to us and foreign policy changes and exchange rate fluctuations additionally both dalsa’s and lecroy’s businesses have been more capital intensive than other teledyne businesses increasing teledyne’s capital requirements 

under sec rules teledyne must issue a report on management’s assessment of the effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting the sec permits a limited timebased exclusion for acquisitions to give a company an opportunity to evaluate more fully the internal controls of acquired companies and correct deficiencies and institute new or additional internal controls our 2013 management’s report specifically excludes from its scope and coverage our 2013 acquisitions of reson axiom cetac and cdl allowing us additional time to evaluate existing internal controls and implement additional controls as appropriate with regard to future acquisitions we can provide no assurance that we will be able to provide a report that contains no significant deficiencies or material weaknesses with respect to these acquired companies or other acquisitions 

in connection with our acquisitions including ones which we do not complete we may incur significant transaction costs we are required to expense as incurred such transaction costs which may have an adverse impact on our quarterly financial results 

we are subject to the risks associated with international sales which could harm our business or results of operations 

during 2013  sales to international customers accounted for approximately 44  of our total revenues compared with 39  in 2012  and 36  in 2011  in 2013 we sold products to customers in over 100 countries the 2013  top five countries for international sales were the united kingdom  norway  china  germany  and south korea  constituting 23  of our total sales our acquisitions including reson in 2013 lecroy in 2012 and dalsa in 2011 contributed to greater international sales we anticipate that future sales to international customers will continue to account for a significant and increasing percentage of our revenues particularly since business and growth plans for many teledyne businesses focus on sales outside of the united states including to emerging markets such as china brazil and west africa 

risks associated with international sales include 

 any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition exchange rate fluctuations may negatively affect the cost of our products to international customers and therefore reduce our competitive position with the 2011 acquisition of canadabased dalsa and the 2012 acquisitions of the majority interest in the parent company of optech also canadabased volatility in the value of the canadian dollar relative to the us dollar or other foreign currencies could adversely affect the business operations and the financial condition of our digital imaging segment 

sales of our products and services internationally are subject to us and local government regulations and procurement policies and practices including regulations relating to importexport control violations of export control rules could result in the suspension of our ability to export items from one or more businesses or the entire corporation depending on the scope of the suspension this could have a material effect on our ability to perform certain international contracts 

among other things we are subject to the us foreign corrupt practices act or fcpa which generally prohibits us companies and their intermediaries from bribing foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or keeping business or otherwise obtaining favorable treatment further in 2011 the united kingdom also implemented the uk bribery act which raised the bar for antibribery law enforcement and compliance relative to the fcpa any determination that we had violated the fcpa the uk bribery act or equivalent antibribery and corruption laws in countries in which we do business could result in sanctions that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations while we have procedures and compliance programs in place and conduct fcpa and other trainings we cannot provide assurance that our internal controls will always protect us from misconduct by our employees agents or business partners 

an increasingly material amount of our total revenues is derived from companies in the offshore oil and gas industry a historically cyclical industry with levels of activity that are significantly affected by the levels and volatility of oil and gas prices 

an increasingly material amount of our total revenues is derived from customers in or connected to the offshore oil and gas exploration development and production industry our largest commercial customer is in this industry and accounted for 36 34 and 29 of total sales in 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively the offshore oil and gas industry is a historically cyclical industry characterized by significant changes in the levels of exploration and development activities oil and gas prices and market expectations of potential changes in those prices significantly affect the levels of those activities worldwide political economic and military events have contributed to oil and gas price volatility and are likely to continue to do so in the future any prolonged reduction in the overall level of offshore oil and gas exploration and development activities whether resulting from changes in oil and gas prices or otherwise could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations of our businesses within our instrumentation segment some factors that have affected and are likely to continue affecting oil and gas prices and the level of demand for our services and products include the following

our dependence on revenue from government contracts subjects us to many risks 

our revenue from government contracts depends on the continued availability of funding from the us government and accordingly we have the risk that funding for our existing contracts may be canceled or diverted to other uses or delayed 

we perform work on a number of contracts with the department of defense and other agencies and departments of the us government including subcontracts with government prime contractors sales under contracts with the us government as a whole including sales under contracts with the department of defense as prime contractor or subcontractor represented approximately 27  of our total revenue in 2013  compared with 32  in 2012  and 36  in 2011  performance under government contracts has inherent risks that could have a material effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

government contracts are conditioned upon the continuing availability of congressional appropriations and the failure of congress to appropriate funds for programs in which we participate could negatively affect our results of operations the us government shutdown during 2013 negatively affected many of our businesses and the failure by congress to approve future budgets on a timely basis could delay procurement of our services and products and cause us to lose future revenues additionally defense spending is expected to continue to decline in some areas over the next few years a continued emphasis on federal deficit and debt reduction could lead to a further decrease in overall defense spending the continued war on terrorism and the winding down of the war in afghanistan also could result in a diversion of funds from programs in which teledyne participates budgetary concerns could result in future contracts being awarded more on price than on other competitive factors and smaller defense budgets could result in government insourcing of programs and more intense competition on programs that are not insourced which could result in lower revenues and profits 

the sequestration provision of the budget control act of 2011 originally imposed 500 billion of defense cuts over nine years starting in fiscal year 2013 which represented approximately 9 of planned defense funding over the period while the recent twoyear budget agreement set forth in the bipartisan budget act of 2013 lessened the acrosstheboard cuts of sequestration sequestration continues to be in effect including for the us department of defense the twoyear budget agreement reduced the 52 billion that the us department of defense was supposed to lose in 2014 by 21 billion which translates to a 12 reduction compared to 2013 as compared to the originally set 6 reduction cuts for 2015 were reduced by 10 billion sequestration has already negatively affected some of the defense programs in which we participate as well including the missile defense agency’s objective simulation framework program and we expect our defense programs to continue to be negatively impacted by the continuing effects of sequestration or other defense spending delays and cuts 

continued defense spending does not necessarily correlate to continued business for us because not all of the programs in which we participate or have current capabilities may be provided with continued funding changes in policy and budget priorities by the president his administration and our congress for various defense and nasa programs could continue to impact our engineered systems and aerospace and defense electronics segments for example changes in national space policy that affect nasa’s budget have occurred there have also been significant reductions in missile defense budgets we anticipate continuing scrutiny of those budgets to impact our revenues our engineered systems segment may be further impacted by delays in production runs under the jassm and harpoon missile programs the timing of program cycles can affect our results of operations for a particular quarter or year it is not uncommon for the department of defense to delay the timing of awards for major programs for six to twelve months or more beyond the original projected timeframe as evidenced by the 2013awards of the test execution services and launch augmentation program reductions and delays in research and development funding by the us government may continue to impact our revenues as darpa reviews its programs aimed to technologically enhance us military capabilities and national security changes to the darpa research and technology development programs in which we participate could occur finally various department of defense initiatives such as the emphasis on insourcing positions to the government and anticipated reductions or cancellations of existing programs could negatively impact our engineered systems segment 

our participation in government programs may decrease or be subject to renegotiation as those programs evolve over time 

the us government has been placing emphasis on small business quotas and increasing small business contract set asides and minimum work percentages in some cases prime contractors are required to reduce participation by large subcontractors like teledyne in order to fill small business quotas and be responsive to proposals and bids as a result our engineered systems segment could be significantly impacted 

over time and for a variety of reasons programs can evolve and affect the extent of our participation for example teledyne brown engineering inc’s groundbased midcourse defense program was negatively impacted by both the nominal end date of development activity and the change in focus of the current administration relative to missile defense 

we have been a significant participant in nasa programs primarily through our engineered systems segment and through teledyne scientific company the current administration introduced significant changes to the national space policy including the cancellation of the nasa’s constellation program which includes ares launch vehicles the administration plans to utilize commercial launch vehicles for crew and cargo iss expeditions and develop a nasa heavy lift launch vehicle for space exploration as a result of these changes we have been attempting to transition our business to meet the needs of the new policy and programs with the further understanding that the existing iss will continue to be fully functional and supported and that the us will continue investment in human space flight while most recently in early 2014 we were awarded a fiveyear 60 million contract by nasa’s marshall space flight center to develop and manufacture the launch vehicle stage adapter for the space launch system failure to further transition our business successfully could result in reduced sales in addition delayed funding and changes in support for nasa’s current space policy could negatively impact our business 

our contracts with the us government are subject to termination rights that could adversely affect us 

most of our us government contracts are subject to termination by the us government either at its convenience or upon the default of the contractor termination for convenience provisions provide only for the recovery of costs incurred or committed settlement expenses and profit on work completed prior to termination termination for default clauses impose liability on the contractor for excess costs incurred by the us government in reprocuring undelivered items from another source we had four  us government contracts terminated for convenience in 2013  compared with six  in 2012  and seven  in 2011  no contracts were terminated for default during such threeyear period 

we may lose money or generate less than expected profits on our fixedprice government contracts and we may lose money if we fail to meet certain prespecified targets in government contracts 

there is no guarantee that us government contracts will be profitable a number of our us government prime contracts and subcontracts are fixedprice type contracts  60  of our total us government contracts were fixedprice in 2013  59  in 2012  and 60  in 2011  under these types of contracts we bear the inherent risk that actual performance cost may exceed the fixed contract price under such contracts we must absorb cost overruns notwithstanding the difficulty of estimating all of the costs we will incur in performing these contracts we cannot assure that our contract loss provisions in our financial statements will be adequate to cover all actual future losses we may lose money on some contracts if we fail to meet these estimates 

our business is subject to government contracting regulations and our failure to comply with such laws and regulations could harm our operating results and prospects 

we like other government contractors are subject to various audits reviews and investigations including private party “whistleblower” lawsuits relating to our compliance with federal and state laws more routinely the us government may audit the costs we incur on our us government contracts including allocated indirect costs such audits could result in adjustments to our contract costs any costs found to be improperly allocated to a specific contract will not be reimbursed and such costs already reimbursed would need to be refunded we have recorded contract revenues based upon costs we expect to realize on final audit in a worst case scenario should a business or division involved be charged with wrongdoing or should the us government determine that the business or division is not a “presently responsible contractor” that business or division and conceivably our company as a whole could be temporarily suspended or in the event of a conviction could be debarred for up to three years from receiving new government contracts or governmentapproved subcontracts in addition we could expend substantial amounts defending against such charges and in damages fines and penalties if such charges were proven or were to result in negotiated settlements 

our indebtedness and any failure to comply with our covenants that apply to our indebtedness could materially and adversely affect our business 

as of december 29 2013  we had 5402 million  in total outstanding indebtedness this indebtedness included 2500 million  in senior unsecured notes 2000 million  in term loans 742 million  under our 7500 million  2013amended credit facility and 160 million  in other debt our indebtedness could harm our business by among other things reducing the funds available to make new strategic acquisitions or reducing our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and market conditions our indebtedness exposes us to interest rate risk since a portion of our debt obligations are at variable rates our indebtedness could also have a material adverse effect on our business by increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions or a downturn in our business general adverse economic and industry conditions or a downturn in our business could result in our inability to repay this indebtedness in a timely manner we may elect to raise other forms of debt capital depending on financial market and economic conditions 

product liability claims product recalls and field service actions could have a material adverse effect on our reputation business results of operations and financial condition and we may have difficulty obtaining product liability and other insurance coverage 

as a manufacturer and distributor of a wide variety of products including monitoring instruments products used in offshore oil and gas production products used in commercial aviation and products used in medical devices most recently including xray detectors our results of operations are susceptible to adverse publicity regarding the quality or safety of our products in part product liability claims challenging the safety of our products may result in a decline in sales for a particular product which could adversely affect our results of operations this could be the case even if the claims themselves are proven untrue or settled for immaterial amounts 

while we have general liability and other insurance policies concerning product liabilities we have selfinsured retentions or deductibles under such policies with respect to a portion of these liabilities awarded damages could be more than our accruals we could incur losses above the aggregate annual policy limit as well we cannot assure that for 2014 and in future years insurance carriers will be willing to renew coverage or provide new coverage for product liability 

product recalls can be expensive and tarnish our reputation and have a material adverse effect on the sales of our products 

we have been joined among a number of defendants often over 100 in lawsuits alleging injury or death as a result of exposure to asbestos in addition because of the prominent “teledyne” name we may continue to be mistakenly joined in lawsuits involving a company or business that was not assumed by us as part of our 1999 spinoff to date we have not incurred material liabilities in connection with these lawsuits however our historic insurance coverage including that of its predecessors may not fully cover such claims and the defense of such matters coverage typically depends on the year of purported exposure and other factors nonetheless we intend to vigorously defend our position against these claims 

certain gas generators historically manufactured by teledyne energy systems inc contained a sealed wetted asbestos component while the company has transitioned to a replacement material had placed warning labels on its products and took care in the handling of this discontinued material by employees there is no assurance that the company will not face product liability or workers compensation claims involving this component 

our teledyne brown engineering inc’s laboratory in knoxville tennessee performs radiological analyses errors and omissions in analyses may occur our insurance coverage or indemnities may not be adequate to cover potential problems associated with faulty radiological analyses 

teledyne brown engineering inc and other teledyne companies manufacture components for customers in the nuclear power market including utilities and certain governmental entities certain liabilities associated with such products are covered by the price anderson act and other statutory and common law defenses and we have received indemnities from some of our customers however there is no assurance we will not face product liability claims related to such products or that our exposure will not exceed the amounts for which we have liability coverage or protection 

we cannot assure that we will not have additional product liability claims or that we will not recall any products 

our pension expense and the value of our pension assets are affected by factors outside of our control including the performance of plan assets the stock market interest rates and actuarial experience 

we have a defined benefit qualified pension plan covering most of our us employees hired prior to 2004 or approximately 20 of our active employees the value of the combined pension assets is currently greater than our pension benefit obligation the accounting rules applicable to our qualified pension plan require that amounts recognized in the financial statements be determined on an actuarial basis rather than as contributions are made to the plan two significant elements in determining our pension income or pension expense are the expected return on plan assets and the discount rate used in projecting pension benefit obligations declines in the stock market and lower rates of return could increase required contributions to our qualified pension plan andor result in a change to shareholders’ equity our investment strategy may not produce the expected returns if the credit financial or stock markets deteriorate any decreases or increases in market interest rates will affect the discount rate assumption used in projecting pension benefit obligations in 2012 in an effort to reduce the risks associated with our current and future domestic pension obligation we amended the pension plan to change the rate at which pension benefits accrue after february 29 2012 and offered and made lump sum payments to certain participants in the plan whose employment with teledyne had terminated in 2013  2012  and 2011  we have made aggregate voluntary pretax cash contributions of 2448 million to the domestic pension plan if and to the extent decreases in our pension assets are not offset by voluntary contributions recovered through future asset returns mitigated by an increase in the rate at which the benefit obligation is discounted or other actions our required cash contributions and pension expense could increase under the plans for additional discussion of pension matters see the discussion under “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition” and notes 2 and 12 to notes to consolidated financial statements 

our future financial results could be adversely impacted by asset impairment charges 

december 29 2013 teledyne’s goodwill was 10378 million and net acquired intangible assets were 2709 million under current accounting guidance we are required to test annually both acquired goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment based upon a fair value approach rather than amortizing them over time we have chosen to perform our annual impairment reviews of goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year based on this most recent annual impairment test we recorded a 12 million asset impairment related to acquired intangible assets but we determined that there was no impairment of goodwill we also are required to test goodwill for impairment between annual tests if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce our enterprise fair value below its book value these events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate including a significant sustained decline in an entity’s market value legal factors operating performance indicators competition sale or disposition of a significant portion of the business or other factors if the fair market value is less than the carrying value including goodwill we could be required to record an impairment charge the valuation of reporting units requires judgment in estimating future cash flows discount rates and estimated product life cycles in making these judgments we evaluate the financial health of the business including such factors as industry performance changes in technology and operating cash flows as we have grown through acquisitions the amount of goodwill and net acquired intangible assets is significant compared with our total assets as a result the amount of any annual or interim impairment could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our reported financial results for the period in which the charge is taken we also may be required to record an earnings charge or incur unanticipated expenses if as a result of a change in strategy or other reason we were to determine the value of other assets had been impaired 

we may not have sufficient resources to fund all future research and development and capital expenditures or possible acquisitions 

in order to remain competitive we must make substantial investments in research and development of new or enhanced products and continuously upgrade our process technology and manufacturing capabilities in september 2006 we acquired a provider of research and development services primarily in the areas of electronics optics information sciences and materials technologies that is currently teledyne scientific company and in 2013 2012 and 2011 we acquired reson lecroy and dalsa respectively each of which had historically made significant investments in research and development relative to total revenues our teledyne scientific company subsidiary has been actively promoting and funding joint research and development projects with other teledyne businesses including our teledyne oil  gas businesses teledyne reynolds inc teledyne brown engineering inc dalsa and lecroy additionally some of our businesses are actively pursuing governmental support and funding for some of their research and development initiatives including dalsa with respect to its cmos and uncooled infrared image sensor development efforts nonetheless we may be unable to fund all of our research and development and capital investment needs or possible acquisitions our ability to raise additional capital will depend on a variety of factors some of which will not be within our control including the existence of bank and capital markets investor perceptions of us our businesses and the industries in which we operate and general economic conditions failure to successfully raise needed capital on a timely or costeffective basis could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition in addition if we fail to accurately predict future customer needs and preferences or fail to produce viable technologies we may invest heavily in research and development of products that do not lead to significant revenue which would adversely affect our profitability 

we may be unsuccessful in our efforts to increase our participation in new markets 

we intend to both adapt our existing technologies and develop new products to expand into new market segments we may be unsuccessful in accessing these and other new markets if our products do not meet our customers’ requirements as a result of changes in either technology and industry standards or because of actions taken by our competitors 

limitations in customer funding for applied research and development and technology insertion projects and government support for research and development expenditures may reduce our ability to apply our ongoing investments in some market areas 

  we may be unable to successfully introduce new and enhanced products in a timely and costeffective manner which could harm our growth and prospects 

our operating results depend in part on our ability to introduce new and enhanced products on a timely basis in order to improve our product development capabilities we purchased the research center that is now teledyne scientific company in 2006 and in 2011 we purchased dalsa which has access to a wellequipped mems research and development center in 2013 we opened a 52000squarefoot technology development center in daytona beach florida primarily to serve the offshore oil and gas production and exploration industries deepwater and harsh environments demand new materials and technology from our teledyne oil  gas businesses to support high temperature high pressure locations successful product development and introduction depend on numerous factors including our ability to anticipate customer and market requirements changes in technology and industry standards our ability to differentiate our offerings from offerings of our 

competitors and market acceptance we may not be able to develop and introduce new or enhanced products in a timely and costeffective manner or to develop and introduce products that satisfy customer requirements 

our new products also may not achieve market acceptance or correctly address new industry standards and technological changes we may also lose any technological advantage to competitors if we fail to develop new products in a timely manner 

additionally new products may trigger increased warranty costs as such products are tested further by actual usage accelerated entry of new products to meet heightened market demand and competitive pressures may cause additional warranty costs as development and testing time periods might be accelerated or condensed 

technological change and evolving industry and regulatory standards could cause some of our products or services to become obsolete or noncompetitive 

the markets for some of our products and services are characterized by rapid technological development evolving industry standards changes in customer requirements and new product introductions and enhancements a faster than anticipated change in one or more of the technologies related to our products or services or in market demand for products or services based on a particular technology could result in faster than anticipated obsolescence of certain of our products or services and could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition currently accepted industry and regulatory standards are also subject to change which may contribute to the obsolescence of our products or services 

we may not be able to reduce the costs of our products to satisfy customers’ cost reduction mandates which could harm our sales or margins 

more and more customers continue to seek price reductions of our products while we continually work to reduce our manufacturing and other costs of our products without affecting product quality and reliability there is no assurance that we will be able to do so and do so in a timely manner to satisfy the pricing pressures of our customers cost reductions of raw materials and other components used in our products may be beyond our control depending on market credit and economic conditions customers may seek lower cost products from china and other developing countries where manufacturing costs are lower 

the airline industry is heavily regulated and if we fail to comply with applicable requirements our results of operations could suffer 

governmental agencies throughout the world including the us federal aviation administration or the faa prescribe standards and qualification requirements for aircraft components including virtually all commercial airline and general aviation products specific regulations vary from country to country although compliance with faa requirements generally satisfies regulatory requirements in other countries if any material authorization or approval qualifying us to supply our products is revoked or suspended then the sale of the product would be prohibited by law which would have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

from time to time the faa or equivalent regulatory agencies in other countries propose new regulations or changes to existing regulations which are usually more stringent than existing regulations if these proposed regulations are adopted and enacted we may incur significant additional costs to achieve compliance which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  increasing competition could reduce the demand for our products and services 

each of our markets is highly competitive many of our competitors have and potential competitors could have greater name recognition a larger installed base of products more extensive engineering manufacturing marketing and distribution capabilities and greater financial technological and personnel resources than we do new or existing competitors may also develop new technologies that could adversely affect the demand for our products and services industry acquisition and consolidation trends particularly among aerospace and defense contractors have adversely impacted demand for our aerospace and defense related engineering services as large prime contractors insource increased amounts of major acquisition programs and also require significant expansion in small business participation to meet government contracting goals lowcost competition from china and other developing countries could also result in decreased demand for our products increasing competition could reduce the volume of our sales or the prices we may charge which would negatively impact our revenues smaller defense budgets both in the united states and europe could result in additional competition for new and existing defense programs 

we sell products to customers in industries that may again undergo rapid and unpredictable changes which could adversely affect our operational results or production levels 

we develop and manufacture products for customers in industries that have undergone rapid changes in the past including the semiconductor and the telecommunications industries in 2009 dalsa experienced a significant decline in demand for its products for the semiconductor and electronics inspection industries these industries or others that we serve may exhibit rapid changes in the future and may adversely affect our operating results or our production levels or both 

our business and financial results could be adversely affected by conditions and other factors associated with our suppliers 

some items we purchase for the manufacture of our products are purchased from limited or single sources of supply due to technical capability price and other factors for example dalsa has an internal single source of supply for ccd semiconductor wafers used to assemble image sensors and an external single source of supply for cmos semiconductor wafers used to assemble xray panel products lecroy continues to outsource a portion of its research and development activities to a third party engineering firm in malaysia where it may be more difficult for us to enforce our intellectual property rights we have also outsourced from time to time the manufacturing of certain parts components subsystems and even finished products to single or limited sources including international sources disruption of these sources could cause delays or reductions in shipments of our products or increases in our costs which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or operations international sources possess additional risks some of which are similar to those described above in regard to international sales with any continuing disruption in the global economy and financial markets some of our suppliers may also continue to face issues gaining access to sufficient credit and materials to maintain their businesses which could reduce the availability of some components and to the extent such suppliers are single source suppliers could adversely affect our ability to continue to manufacture and sell our products continuing economic pressure on suppliers may also trigger increased pricing or workforce reductions or reduced workweeks possibly creating longer lead times to obtain needed components for our products 

some of our commercial product lines may have one or a limited number of customers the loss of which could adversely affect our business or financial results 

while no commercial customer accounted for more than 10 of our total sales during 2013  2012  and 2011  and we have hundreds of customers in the various industries that we serve certain product lines may have one or a few key customers the loss of which could adversely affect our business or financial results teledyne’s largest commercial customer a customer of our instrumentation segment accounted for 36  34  and 29  of total sales in 2013  2012  and 2011  respectively 

newer products such as our xray panel products may initially be more heavily dependent on a singular or limited number of customers until market acceptance is obtained or due to contractual terms similarly some older product lines may be more heavily dependent on a singular or limited number of customers in either such case program delays of such customer or customers as well as the loss of such customer or customers could adversely affect our business or financial results 

we face risks related to sales through distributors and other third parties that we do not control which could harm our business 

we sell a portion of our products through third parties such as distributors valueadded resellers and oems collectively “distributors” using third parties for distribution exposes teledyne to many risks including competitive pressure concentration credit risk and compliance risks we may rely on one or more key distributors for a product and the loss of these distributors could reduce our revenue distributors may face financial difficulties including bankruptcy which could harm our collection of accounts receivables and financial results violations of the fcpa or similar antibribery laws by distributors or other third party intermediaries could have a material impact on our business failing to manage risks related to our use of distributors may reduce sales increase expenses and weaken our competitive position and could result in sanctions against us 

compliance with increasing environmental and climate change regulations as well as the effects of potential environmental liabilities could have a material adverse financial effect on us 

we like other industry participants are subject to various federal state local and international environmental laws and regulations we may be subject to increasingly stringent environmental standards in the future particularly as greenhouse gas emissions and climate change regulations and initiatives increase future developments administrative actions or liabilities relating to environmental and climate change matters could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition environmental regulations on hydraulic fracturing could adversely affect some product lines of our instrumentation segment 

  

our manufacturing operations could expose us to material environmental liabilities and companies we acquire may have environmental liabilities that are not accurately assessed or brought to our attention at the time of the acquisition in 2013 we established an environmental reserve of 53 million related to potential soil remediation activities at a former leased facility 

for additional discussion of environmental matters see the discussion under the caption “other matters  environmental” of “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of results of operation and financial condition” and note 15 to our notes to consolidated financial statements 

the us environmental protection agency “epa” has focused on greenhouse gases “ghgs” maintaining ghgs threaten the public health and welfare of the american people the epa also maintains that ghg emissions from onroad vehicles contribute to that threat the epa’s endangerment finding covers emissions of six greenhouse gases the epa’s continuing efforts to limit ghg emissions could adversely affect our us manufacturing operations increase prices for energy fuel and transportation require us to accommodate changes in parameters such as the way parts are manufactured and may in some cases require us to redesign of certain products this could lead to increased costs which we may not be able to recover from customers delays in product shipments and loss of market share to competitors 

our inability to attract and retain key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our future success 

our future success depends to a significant extent upon the continued service of our executive officers and other key management and technical personnel and on our ability to continue to attract retain and motivate qualified personnel we also have a maturing work force while we have engaged in succession planning the loss of the services of one or more of our key employees or our failure to attract retain and motivate qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we may not be able to sell exit or reconfigure businesses that we determine no longer meet with our growth strategy 

consistent with our strategy to emphasize growth in our core markets we continually evaluate our businesses to ensure that they are aligned with our strategy this review led to the decision to sell our general aviation piston engine businesses which sale was completed in april 2011 as a result of our review and declines in our electronic manufacturing services businesses in 2013 we closed our teledyne microelectronics technologies’ facility in marina del rey california and relocated several of its product lines to other teledyne locations in further response to downturns in our defense businesses in 2013 we also began consolidating some of our microelectronic component operations into our mountain view california facility and also our shipley england facility and relatedly sold a former manufacturing site in sunnyvale california additionally we closed teledyne cml group limited’s precision machining and fabrications business in birkenhead england to focus more on its advanced composites manufacturing business for 2014 we are planning to consolidate certain instrumentation operations and complete the consolidation of some microelectronic component product lines 

our ability to dispose of exit or reconfigure businesses that may no longer be aligned with our growth strategy will depend on many factors including the terms and conditions of any asset purchase and sale agreement as well as industry business and economic conditions we cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to sell nonstrategic businesses on terms that are acceptable to us or at all in addition if the sale of any nonstrategic business cannot be consummated or is not practical alternative courses of action including relocation of product lines or closure may not be available to us or may be more costly than anticipated 

our inability to efficiently implement changes to our enterprise resource planning software could result in higher than expected costs or otherwise adversely impact our internal controls environment operations and profitability 

we are implementing an enterprise resource planning software system which is intended to improve our business processes in certain business units the costs associated with such systems are significant and we could incur costs in excess of budgeted costs any technical or other difficulties in developing or implementing this initiative may increase the costs of the project and have an adverse effect on our operations and reporting processes including our internal controls over financial reporting as we make adjustments to operations as a result of this project we may incur incremental expenses prior to realizing the benefits of a more efficient workforce and operating structure although implementation has occurred in only selected business units to date and efforts have been made to minimize adverse impacts on our controls we cannot assure that all such impacts have been mitigated further we may not realize anticipated cost improvements and greater efficiencies from the project 

natural and manmade disasters could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

several of our facilities as a result of their locations could be subject to a catastrophic loss caused by earthquakes hurricanes tornados floods ice storms or other natural disasters many of our production facilities and our headquarters are located in california and thus are in areas with above average seismic activity and may also be at risk of damage in wildfires teledyne dalsa’s semiconductor facilities in quebec canada have been impacted by severe ice storms including a storm in 2013 in addition we have manufacturing facilities in the southeastern united states and texas that have been threatened and struck by major hurricanes in october 2012 lecroy and other teledyne facilities incurred business interruptions and were without power for several days as a result of hurricane sandy our facilities in alabama florida nebraska tennessee and virginia have also been threatened by tornados in june 2012 a tornado caused substantial damage to and interrupted business at our teledyne hastings instruments facility in hampton virginia in april 2011 tornados caused substantial damage in huntsville alabama while teledyne brown engineering’s main facility in huntsville alabama incurred minimal building damage and business interruption the facility was without power for several days if any of our california facilities including our california headquarters were to experience a catastrophic earthquake or wildfire loss or if any of our alabama florida louisiana nebraska tennessee or texas facilities were to experience a catastrophic hurricane storm tornado or other natural disaster or if dalsa’s facilities in quebec experience longterm loss of electrical power such event could disrupt our operations delay production shipments and revenue and result in large expenses to repair or replace the facility or facilities while teledyne has property insurance to partially reimburse it for losses caused by windstorm and earth movement such insurance would not cover all possible losses in addition our existing disaster recovery and business continuity plans including those relating to our information technology systems may not be fully responsive to or minimize losses associated with catastrophic events 

the environmental disaster triggered by the deepwater horizon rig explosion and oil spill in 2010 resulted in a moratorium on offshore oil and gas production in the gulf of mexico that adversely affected the results of operations of some of our teledyne oil and gas businesses although such adverse impact was offset in part by the products we manufacture that supported wellcapping and environmental cleanup efforts environmental regulations enacted in the wake of this oil spill have resulted in increased compliance costs to some of our teledyne oil and gas businesses similar future manmade disasters that limit or cease offshore oil and gas production or further exploration in the regions in which we sell our products could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

disasters that do not directly impact us can have an indirect adverse impact on our business for example in 2011 the earthquake in northern japan and the related tsunami and severe flooding in thailand resulted in certain of our customers delaying orders for our products because they were unable to obtain critical supplies from vendors in the impacted areas 

teledyne brown engineering inc is building an imaging platform to be affixed to the iss for the program to be financially successful the 15 yearold iss must continue to fly in a safe and human tended condition while certain spaceflight risks such as a high velocity debris impact to the station causing significant structural damage or necessitating the evacuation of the iss have been regarded as small if such event were to occur the iss program continuation could be threatened jeopardizing our investment and potential revenue generation from issbased earth imaging 

we may not be able to enforce or protect our intellectual property rights or third parties may claim infringement of their intellectual rights each which may harm our ability to compete and thus harm our business 

our ability to enforce and protect our patents copyrights software licenses trade secrets know how and other intellectual property rights is subject to general litigation risks as well as uncertainty as to the enforceability of our intellectual property rights in various countries when we seek to enforce our rights we have found that various claims may be asserted against us including claims that our intellectual property right is invalid is otherwise not enforceable or is licensed to the party against whom we are asserting a claim in addition we may be the target of aggressive and opportunistic enforcement of patents by third parties if we are not ultimately successful in defending ourselves against these claims in litigation we may not be able to sell a particular product or family of products due to an injunction or we may have to pay damages that could in turn harm our results of operations our inability to enforce our intellectual property rights under these circumstances may harm our competitive position and our business 

our business and operations could suffer in the event of cyber security breaches 

attempts by others to gain unauthorized access to our information technology systems have become more sophisticated and are sometimes successful these attempts which might be related to industrial or foreign government espionage or activism include covertly introducing malware to our computers and networks performing reconnaissance and impersonating authorized users among other activities we continue to update our infrastructure and processes to protect against security incidents including both external and internal threats and to prevent their recurrence company personnel and third parties have been tasked to detect and investigate such incidents but it is possible that we might not be aware of an incident or its magnitude and effects the theft unauthorized use or publication of our intellectual property andor confidential business information could harm our competitive position reduce the value of our investment in research and development and other strategic initiatives or otherwise adversely affect our business the us department of defense has recently promulgated additional regulations applicable to certain types of data residing on or transiting through certain information systems and we expect these regulations will be implemented into certain contracts we hold to the extent that any security breach results in inappropriate disclosure of confidential or controlled information of third parties or the us government we may incur liability or the loss of security clearances as a result in addition we expect to continue devoting additional resources to the security of our information technology systems more resources may be required in the defense arena to the extent the us government increases its cyber security mandates 

increases in our effective tax rate may harm our results of operations 

our effective tax rate for 2013  was 177 compared with 287  for 2012  and 329  for 2011  fiscal years 2013  2012  and 2011  included net discrete tax benefits of 213 million 54 million  and 24 million  respectively excluding these items teledyne’s effective tax rates for 2013  2012  and 2011  would have been 271 310  and 340  respectively while there continues to be congressional discussion about lowering the corporate tax rate in the us to improve global competitiveness a number of factors may impact our effective tax rates which could reduce our net income including 

 our financial statements are based on estimates required by gaap and actual results may differ materially from those estimated under different assumptions or conditions 

our financial statements are prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states these principles require our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period for example estimates are used when accounting for items such as asset valuations allowances for doubtful accounts allowance for excess and obsolete inventory depreciation and amortization impairment assessments employee benefits taxes recall and warranty costs product and general liability and contingencies while we base our estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances at the time made actual results may differ materially from those estimated our most critical accounting estimates are described in the management discussion in this form 10k and in teledyne’s 2013 annual report to stockholders under critical accounting estimates 

while we believe our internal control systems are effective there are inherent limitations in all control systems and misstatements resulting from error or fraud may occur and may not be detected 

we continue to take action to assure compliance with the internal controls disclosure controls and other requirements of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer cannot guarantee that our internal controls and disclosure controls will prevent all possible errors or all fraud a control system no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met in addition the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefit of controls must be relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no system of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within the company have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns 

can occur because of simple error or mistake further controls can be circumvented by individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more persons or by management override of the controls the design of any system of controls is also based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions over time a control may be inadequate because of changes in conditions or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate because of inherent limitations in a costeffective control system misstatements resulting from error or fraud may occur and may not be detected 

provisions of our governing documents applicable law and our change in control severance agreements could make an acquisition of teledyne more difficult 

our restated certificate of incorporation our amended and restated bylaws and the general corporation law of the state of delaware contain several provisions that could make the acquisition of control of teledyne in a transaction not approved by our board of directors more difficult we have also entered into change in control severance agreements with 16 members of our current management which could have an antitakeover effect these provisions may prevent or discourage attempts to acquire our company 

the market price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly since we became a public company and could continue to do so 

since we became an independent public company on november 29 1999 the market price of our common stock has fluctuated substantially and fluctuations in our stock price could continue among the factors that could affect our stock price are 

 the stock markets in general and the markets for high technology companies in particular have experienced a high degree of volatility that is not necessarily related to the operating performance of these companies we cannot provide assurances as to our stock price

teledyne technologies incorporated provides enabling technologies for industrial growth markets we have evolved from a company that was primarily focused on aerospace and defense to one that serves multiple markets that require advanced technology and high reliability these markets include deepwater oil and gas exploration and production oceanographic research air and water quality environmental monitoring factory automation and medical imaging our products include monitoring instrumentation for marine and environmental applications harsh environment interconnects electronic test and measurement equipment digital imaging sensors and cameras aircraft information management systems and defense electronic and satellite communication subsystems we also supply engineered systems for defense space environmental and energy applications we differentiate ourselves from many of our direct competitors by having a customer and company sponsored applied research center that augments our product development expertise 

strategyoverview 

our strategy continues to emphasize growth in our core markets of instrumentation digital imaging aerospace and defense electronics and engineered systems our core markets are characterized by high barriers to entry and include specialized products and services not likely to be commoditized we intend to strengthen and expand our core businesses with targeted acquisitions and through product development we aggressively pursue operational excellence to continually improve our margins and earnings at teledyne operational excellence includes the rapid integration of the businesses we acquire using complementary technology across our businesses and internal research and development we seek to create new products to grow our company and expand our addressable markets we continue to evaluate our businesses to ensure that they are aligned with our strategy 

consistent with this strategy we made four acquisitions in 2013  five acquisitions in 2012  and three acquisitions in 2011 as well as one significant divestiture in 2011 in addition in 2013 a subsidiary of teledyne purchased  the remaining 49 interest in nova research inc “nova sensors” we acquired reson as “reson” to increase our capabilities related to multibeam sonar systems and specialty acoustic sensors for hydrography global marine infrastructure and offshore energy operations we acquired cd limited “cdl” to obtain additional inertial sensing and navigation products and to accelerate the development of realtime motion sensing and communication systems for our subsea oil and gas customers  we acquired sd acquisition inc dba cetac technologies “cetac” to expand our automated sample handling and sample introduction equipment for laboratory instrumentation capabilities these three acquisitions are part of the  instrumentation

our largest acquisition in 2012 lecroy corporation “lecroy” broadened our portfolio of analytical instrumentation with the addition of electronic test and measurement solutions we acquired varisystems inc “varisystems” to expand our portfolio of rugged interconnect solutions we acquired blueview technologies inc “blueview” principally to increase our instrumentation content on auvs and rovs used in oil and gas and marine survey applications through the acquisition of a majority interest in the parent company of optech incorporated “optech” we added 3d imaging capability to our portfolio of visible xray and ultraviolet sensors cameras optech ’ s bathymetric lidar systems are used for coastal mapping and shallow water profiling also complement our marine survey sensors and systems the acquisition of the parent company of pdm neptec limited “pdm neptec” expanded our line of harsh environmental marine connectors in 2011 we focused on the expansion of our digital imaging capabilities first with the acquisition of dalsa corporation “dalsa” followed by the acquisitions of a majority interest in nova sensors and a minority interest investment in optech in april 2011 we completed the sale of our general aviation piston engine businesses and consequently classified our aerospace engines and components segment as a discontinued operation 

during 2013 in an effort to reduce ongoing costs and improve operating performance we took actions to consolidate and relocate certain facilities and reduce headcount across various businesses reducing our exposure to weak end markets and high cost locations in connection with these efforts in 2013 we incurred pretax charges totaling 240 million for severance and facility consolidation expense and environmental reserves the charges were comprised of 104 million in severance related costs and 136 million in facility closure and relocation costs which included 53 million of environmental reserves the actions have been substantially completed by year end 2013 we expect to incur approximately 04 million in expense related to the completion of the actions in the first quarter of 2014 at december 29 2013 we had 114 million in reserves related to these actions of which 97 million are classified as shortterm reserves 

given the strength of our commercial businesses as well as our strategic acquisitions we were able to achieve record sales and earnings in 2013 in 2013  sales and net income from continuing operations increased by 99  and 127  respectively over 2012  results earnings per share from continuing operations in 2013  increased 125  over 2012  in 2013  sales totaled 23386 million  compared with sales of 21273 million  in 2012  net income from continuing operations for 2013  was 1850 million  or 487  per diluted share compared with 1618 million  or 433  per diluted share in 2012  the increase in revenue included incremental sales from acquisitions of 1720 million as well as organic growth our 2013 net income attributable to teledyne was 1850 million  or 487  per diluted share compared with 1641 million  or 439  per diluted share in 2012  net income for 2013 and 2012 also included net discrete tax benefits of 213 million and 54 million respectively 

with the recent acquisitions in 2013 and the 2012 acquisition of lecroy and the 2011 acquisition of dalsa as well as growth in our commercial markets our business mix has continued to evolve for 2013  teledyne ’ s sales were approximately 73  to commercial customers and 27  to the us government this has changed from about 68  commercial and 32  government in 2012  our international sales also increased to 44  of total sales in 2013  compared with 39  in 2012  we have worked to transform our product portfolio into that of a high technology industrial company that is less dependent on us government business

see note 3 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information about our recent acquisitions 

our fiscal year is determined based on a 52 or 53week convention ending on the sunday nearest to december 31 fiscal years 2013  2012  and 2011  each contained 52 weeks the following is our financial information for 2013  2012  and 2011  in millions except pershare amounts 

  

  

our businesses are divided into four business segments instrumentation digital imaging aerospace and defense electronics and engineered systems our four business segments and their respective percentage contributions to our total sales in 2013  2012  and 2011  are summarized in the following table   



results of operations 

2013 compared with 2012 



  

we reported 2013  sales of 23386 million  compared with sales of 21273 million  for 2012  an increase of 99  net income from continuing operations was 1850 million   487  per diluted share for 2013  compared with net income from continuing operations of 1618 million   433  per diluted share for 2012    an increase of 143  net income for 2013  and 2012  also included net discrete tax benefits of 213 million  and 54 million  respectively net income attributable to teledyne including discontinued operations was 1850 million   487  per diluted share for 2013  compared with 1641 million   439  per diluted share for 2012  

the increase in sales in 2013  compared with 2012  reflected higher sales in both the instrumentation and aerospace and defense electronics segments partially offset by lower sales in both the engineered systems and digital imaging segments sales in the instrumentation segment reflected 1784 million of incremental sales from recent acquisitions as well as higher organic sales for marine products increased sales of test and measurement instrumentation of 1036 million reflected the full year contribution from the lecroy acquisition sales of marine products increased by 1067 million and included incremental sales of 653 million from recent acquisitions sales in the aerospace and defense electronics segment primarily reflected increased sales of 193 million from avionics products and electronic relays sales in the digital imaging segment decreased slightly the decrease in the engineered systems segment revenue primarily reflected lower sales of 238 million from engineered products and services the incremental increase in revenue in 2013  from businesses acquired in 2013  and in 2012  was 1720 million  

sales under contracts with the us government were approximately 27  of sales in 2013 and 32 of sales in 2012 principally reflective of our recent acquisitions such decline has been consistent with our strategy to be less dependent on us government business sales to international customers represented approximately 44  of sales in 2013 and 39 of sales in 2012 

segment operating profit and other segment income for 2013  compared with 2012  decreased by 19 million or only 07 despite 240 million in pretax charges for severance and facility consolidation expense and environmental reserves compared with 17 million of similar charges in 2012 for 2013 the charges impacted each business segment as follows aerospace and defense electronics 157 million digital imaging 39 million instrumentation 25 million and engineered systems 19 million in 2012 we incurred 17 million of similar charges which only impacted the aerospace and defense electronics segment segment operating profit and other segment income for 2013  also reflected the impact of acquisitions as well as the impact of higher organic sales in each segment except the engineered systems segment operating profit included incremental operating profit from acquisitions of 117 million which included intangible amortization of 50 million lifo income was 07 million  in 2013  and was less than 01 million in 2012  

the table below presents sales and cost of sales by segment and total company 



total company cost of sales increased by 1209 million  in 2013  compared with 2012  and reflected 794 million in cost of sales from recent acquisitions 154 million in higher severance and facility consolidation expense and environmental reserves higher pension expense as well as the impact of organic sales increases the instrumentation segment cost of sales increase of 1122 million reflected the impact of recent acquisitions as well as the impact of organic sales increases the aerospace and defense electronics segment increase in cost of sales of 284 million reflected the impact of higher sales as well as 140 million in severance and facility consolidation expense and environmental reserves the total company cost of sales as a percentage of sales for 2013  was 641  compared with 648  for 2012  the lower cost of sales percentage reflected the impact of the lecroy and optech cost structures which have a lower cost of sales percentage than the overall teledyne cost of sales percentage partially offset by severance and facility consolidation expense and environmental reserves excluding the impact of recent acquisitions cost of sales as a percentage of sales for 2013  would have been 668 compared with 648 in 2012 the higher percentage in 2013 reflects the impact of severance and facility consolidation expense and environmental reserves higher pension expense and product mix differences in 2013 

selling general and administrative expenses including research and development and bid and proposal expense in total dollars were higher in 2013 compared with 2012 the increase reflected the impact of higher sales higher acquired intangible asset amortization of 50 million and higher research and development costs of 378 million corporate administrative expense in 2013 was 376 million compared with 367 million in 2012 an increase of 25 for 2013 we recorded a total of 107 million in stock option expense of which 34 million was recorded as corporate expense and 73 million was recorded in segment results for 2012 we recorded a total of 80 million in stock option expense of which 24 million was recorded as corporate expense and 56 million was recorded in segment results selling general and administrative expenses for 2013 as a percentage of sales increased to 256 compared with 237 for 2012 and reflected the impact of higher research and development costs and the recently acquired lecroy and optech cost structures which have a higher selling general and administrative expense percentage of sales than the overall teledyne selling general and administrative expense percentage of sales 

included in operating profit in 2013 was domestic pension expense of 175 million  in accordance with us government cost accounting standards “cas” 145 million  was recoverable from certain government contracts included in operating profit in 2012 was domestic pension expense of 66 million  in accordance with cas 127 million  was recoverable from certain government contracts the increase in pension expense primarily reflected the impact of using a 44 discount rate to determine the benefit obligation for the domestic plan in 2013 compared with a 55 discount rate used in 2012 for the company’s domestic pension plan the discount rate for 2014 will increase to 54 from 44 which will decrease pension expense for 2014 compared with 2013 pension expense determined under cas can generally be recovered through the pricing of products and services sold to the us government 

the company’s effective tax rate for 2013 was 177 compared with 287 for 2012 the decrease reflected higher net discrete tax benefits in 2013 as well as a change in the proportion of domestic and international income fiscal year 2013 included net discrete tax benefits of 213 million primarily related to the statute of limitation expirations favorable tax audit resolutions research and development credits and the remeasurement of uncertain tax positions fiscal year 2012 included net discrete tax benefits of 54 million related to the remeasurement of uncertain tax positions and an expiration of the statute of limitations in the united states excluding the impact of the net discrete tax benefits of 213 million for 2013 and 54 million for 2012 the effective tax rates would have been 271 for 2013 compared with 310 for 2012 which reflected a change in the proportion of domestic and international income 

  during the next twelve months it is reasonably possible that favorable tax audit resolutions and expirations of the statutes of limitations could reduce unrecognized tax benefits by 83 million either because our tax positions are sustained on audit because the company agrees to their disallowance or because of the expiration of the statutes of limitations of the 83 million 13 million would not impact tax expense as it would be offset by the reversal of deferred tax assets 

total interest expense including credit facility fees and other bank charges was 209 million in 2013 and 182 million in 2012 interest income was 05 million in 2013 and 04 million in 2012 the increase in interest expense reflected the impact of higher outstanding debt levels partially offset by lower overall average interest rates 

other income and expense in 2013 included 36 million from the reversal of reserves no longer needed in connection with a legal settlement other income in 2012 included foreign currency translation gains of 08 million 

2012 compared with 2011

cost of sales increased by 1122 million  in 2013  compared with 2012  and reflected the impact of higher sales product mix differences and 25 million in severance and facility consolidation expenses the decrease in the cost of sales percentage to 558 from 570 largely reflected the impact of recent acquisitions which carry a lower cost of sales percentage than the average for our other businesses in this segment partially offset by product mix differences selling general and administrative expenses including research and development and bid and proposal expense in 2013 increased by 899 million compared with 2012 and reflected the impact of acquisitions primarily lecroy and reson the lecroy and reson acquisitions represented 777 million of the increase in selling general and administrative expenses which included 275 million in incremental research and development expenses selling general and administrative expenses for 2013  as a percentage of sales increased to 284  compared with 249  for 2012  and reflected higher research and development costs and the lecroy cost structure which has a higher selling general and administrative expense percentage of sales than other instrumentation businesses 

2012 compared with 2011 

our instrumentation segment sales were 8047 million in 2012 compared with sales of 6482 million in 2011 an increase of 241 operating profit was 1460 million in 2012 compared with 1293 million in 2011 an increase of 129 

the 2012 sales change resulted primarily from higher sales of marine instrumentation test and measurement instrumentation and environmental instrumentation the higher sales of 693 million for marine instrumentation products reflected increased sales of interconnect systems used in offshore energy production and also included a total of 330 million in revenue from the acquisitions of varisystems pdm neptec and blueview increased sales of 808 million for test and measurement instrumentation resulted from the acquisition of lecroy the increase in sales of 64 million for environmental instrumentation primarily reflected higher domestic sales of air quality monitoring instrumentation products the increase in operating profit reflected the impact of higher sales improved margins for marine instrumentation partially offset by 68 million in acquisition expenses and 39 million in additional intangible asset amortization related to recent 

acquisitions the incremental operating profit included in the results for 2012 from recent acquisitions was 32 million 

cost of sales increased by 829 million in 2012 compared with 2011 and reflected the impact of higher sales and product mix differences the decrease in the cost of sales percentage to 570 from 580 largely reflected the impact of the lecroy acquisition whose products which carry a lower cost of sales percentage than the average for other products partially offset by product mix differences segment operating profit in 2012 also reflected lifo income of 03 million compared with lifo expense of 05 million in 2011 selling general and administrative expenses for 2012 as a percentage of sales increased to 249 compared with 221 for 2011 and reflected the impact of acquisition related expenses higher research and development costs and the lecroy cost structure which has a higher selling general and administrative expense percentage of sales than other instrumentation businesses 

digital imaging 



our digital imaging segment includes high performance sensors cameras and systems within the visible infrared and xray spectra for use in industrial government and medical applications as well as mems it also includes our sponsored and centralized research laboratories benefiting government programs and businesses

financial condition liquidity and capital resources 

principal capital requirements 

our principal capital requirements are to fund working capital needs capital expenditures voluntary and required pension contributions debt service requirements share repurchases and acquisitions it is anticipated that operating cash flow together with available borrowings under the credit facility described below will be sufficient to meet these requirements and could be used to fund acquisitions in 2014 to support acquisitions we may need to raise additional capital our liquidity is not dependent upon the use of offbalance sheet financial arrangements we have no offbalance sheet financing arrangements that incorporate the use of special purpose or unconsolidated entities 

revolving credit agreement and senior notes 

in march 2013 the company amended its 5500 million credit facility to increase the borrowing capacity to 7500 million and extend the maturity date from february 2016 to march 2018 the other material terms of the credit facility including covenants remain unchanged excluding interest and fees no payments are due under the credit facility until it matures in november 2013 the company amended its 2000 million term loan agreements to extend the maturity dates from october 2015 to march 2019 and to lower the applicable interest rate the other material terms of the term loan agreement including covenants remain unchanged the credit agreements require the company to comply with various financial and operating covenants including maintaining certain consolidated leverage and interest coverage ratios borrowings under our credit facility and term loans are at variable rates which are at our option tied to a eurocurrency rate equal to libor london interbank offered rate plus an applicable rate or a base rate as defined in our credit agreements eurocurrency rate loans may be denominated in us dollars or an alternative currency as defined in the agreement eurocurrency or libor based loans under the facility typically have terms of one two three or six months and the interest rate for each such loan is subject to change if the loan is continued or converted following the applicable maturity date the company has not drawn any loans with a term longer than three months under the credit facility base rate loans have interest rates that primarily fluctuate with changes in the prime rate interest rates are also subject to change based on our consolidated leverage ratio as defined in the credit agreement the credit facility also provides for facility fees that vary between 0125 and 030 of the credit line depending on our consolidated leverage ratio as calculated from time to time 

longterm debt consisted of the following in millions   



the company also has 123 million  in capital leases of which 14 million  is current at december 29 2013  teledyne had 146 million  in outstanding letters of credit 

the credit agreements require the company to comply with various financial and operating covenants including maintaining certain consolidated leverage and interest coverage ratios as well as minimum net worth levels and limits on acquired debt at december 29 2013  the company was in compliance with these covenants and we had a significant amount of margin between required financial covenant ratios and our actual ratios currently we do not believe our ability to undertake additional debt financing if needed is reasonably likely to be materially impacted by debt restrictions under our credit agreements subject to our complying with required financial covenants listed in the table below 

at december 29 2013  the required financial covenant ratios and the actual ratios were as follows   



 available borrowing capacity under the 7500 million credit facility which is reduced by borrowings and outstanding letters of credit was 6620 million  at december 29 2013  teledyne also has a 50 million uncommitted credit line which permits credit extensions up to 50 million plus an incremental 20 million solely for standby letters of credit this credit line is utilized as needed for periodic cash needs no amounts are outstanding under this facility at december 29 2013  the maximum amount that could be borrowed under our 7500 million credit facility as of december 29 2013  while still remaining in compliance with our consolidated leverage ratio covenant was 6620 million  

permanently reinvested earnings 

we consider the earnings of material nonus subsidiaries to be indefinitely invested outside the united states on the basis of estimates that future domestic cash generation will be sufficient to meet future domestic cash requirements at december 29 2013  the amount of undistributed foreign earnings was 1280 million we have not recorded a deferred tax liability of approximately 312 million related to the 1280 million of undistributed foreign earnings should we decide to repatriate the foreign earnings we would need to adjust our income tax provision in the period we determined that the earnings will no longer be indefinitely invested outside the united states 

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our expected cash outflows resulting from financial contracts and commitments at december 29 2013  we have not included information on our normal recurring purchases of materials for use in our operations these amounts are generally consistent from year to year closely reflect our levels of production and are not longterm in nature in millions 



  

 

unrecognized tax benefits of 354 million are not included in the table above because 45 million is offset by deferred tax assets and the remainder cannot be reasonably estimated to be settled in cash due to a lack of prior settlement history 

at december 29 2013  we are not required to make any cash contributions to the domestic qualified pension plan for 2014 teledyne expects to make a £15 million contribution to a foreignbased pension plan in 2014 our minimum funding requirements after 2014 as set forth by erisa are dependent on several factors as discussed under “accounting for pension 

plans” in the critical accounting policies section of this management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation estimates beyond 2014 have not been provided due to the significant uncertainty of these amounts which are subject to change until the company’s pension assumptions can be updated at the appropriate times in addition certain pension contributions are eligible for future recovery through the pricing of products and services to the us government under certain government contracts therefore the amounts noted are not necessarily indicative of the impact these contributions may have on our liquidity we also have payments due under our other postretirement benefit plans these plans are not required to be funded in advance but are pay as you go see further discussion in note 12 of the notes to consolidated financial statements teledyne intends to continue to monitor and manage its defined pension benefit plans obligation and may take additional actions in the future 

operating activities 

in 2013  net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations was 2041 million  compared with 1895 million  in 2012  and 2195 million  in 2011  the higher cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations in 2013 compared with 2012 reflected lower cash contributions to the domestic pension plan and higher net income partially offset by higher income tax payments the 2013 net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations amount includes voluntary cash contributions of 830 million to the domestic pension plan compared with 928 million in voluntary cash contributions to the domestic pension plan for 2012 and 690 million in voluntary cash contributions to the domestic pension plan for 2011 the lower cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations in 2012 compared with 2011 reflected the impact of the timing of accounts receivable collections and higher cash contributions to the domestic pension plan partially offset by lower income tax payments 

free cash flow cash from operating activities from continuing operations less capital expenditures was 1315 million  in 2013  compared with 1242 million  in 2012  and 1778 million  in 2011  adjusted free cash flow eliminates the impact of pension contributions on a net of tax basis and was 1829 million  in 2013 compared with 1845 million  in 2012  and 2218 million  in 2011

balance sheet changes 

the changes in the following selected components of teledyne’s balance sheet are discussed below in millions 



the higher balances in accounts receivable inventories goodwill and acquired intangible assets were impacted by the acquisitions made in 2013  the increase in other longterm liabilities reflects deferred tax liabilities related to the noncash reduction to stockholders’ equity for the pension and postretirement plans partially offset by lower pension liabilities in 2013 due to pension plan assets gains and pretax pension contributions the domestic pension plan amounts recognized in the consolidated balance sheets changed from an unfunded pension liability to a prepaid pension asset this also impacted the balance of accumulated other comprehensive loss which reflects a noncash adjustment in 2013 of 1080 million the higher balances in property plant and equipment also reflected the impact of acquisitions made in 2013  acquisitions as well as capital spending partially offset by depreciation longterm debt decreased and reflected cash flow applied against debt partially offset by the impact of funds used for acquisitions in 2013 and pension contributions 

investing activities 

net cash used in investing activities included capital expenditures as presented below in millions 



during 2014 we plan to invest approximately 770 million  in capital expenditures principally to upgrade capital equipment reduce manufacturing costs implement an enterprise resource planning software system and introduce new products commitments at december 29 2013  for capital expenditures were approximately 129 million

at yearend 2013  we had 6620 million  of available committed credit under the 7500 million credit facility which can be utilized as needed for daily operating and periodic cash needs including acquisitions teledyne also has a 50 million uncommitted credit line which permits credit extensions up to 50 million plus an incremental 20 million solely for standby letters of credit this credit line is utilized as needed for periodic cash needs there were no outstanding funding advances under the uncommitted credit line at december 29 2013  total debt at yearend 2013  includes 2500 million  outstanding in senior notes 2000 million  in term loans 742 million  outstanding under the 7500 million credit facility and 160 million  in other debt the company also has 123 million  outstanding under capital leases of which 14 million  is current at yearend 2013  teledyne had 146 million  in outstanding letters of credit

other matters 

income taxes 

our income tax expense deferred tax assets and liabilities and reserves for unrecognized tax benefits reflect management’s best assessment of estimated current and future taxes to be paid we are subject to income taxes in both the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions significant judgments and estimates are required in determining the consolidated income tax expense 

the company’s effective tax rate for 2013  was 177  compared with 287  for 2012  and 329  for 2011  fiscal years 2013  2012  and 2011  included net discrete tax benefits of 213 million  54 million  and 24 million  respectively these relate primarily to the remeasurement of uncertain tax positions including expirations of the statute of limitations and favorable resolution of tax matters and increased federal tax credits for research and development excluding these items the company’s effective tax rates for fiscal years 2013  2012  and 2011  would have been 271  310  and 340  respectively the lower 2013 effective tax rate compared with the 2012 effective tax rate excluding the net discrete tax benefits primarily reflected increased federal tax credits for research and development a lower state effective tax rate and a change in the portion of foreign and domestic income based on the company’s history of operating earnings expectations of future operating earnings and potential tax planning strategies management believes that it is possible that some portion of deferred taxes will not be realized as a future tax benefit and therefore has recorded a valuation allowance deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amount in the financial statements which will result in taxable or deductible amounts in the future in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets within the jurisdiction from which they arise we consider all available positive and negative evidence including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities projected future taxable income taxplanning strategies and results of recent operations in projecting future taxable income we begin with historical results adjusted for the results of discontinued operations and incorporate assumptions about the amount of future state federal and foreign pretax operating income adjusted for items that do not have tax consequences the assumptions about future taxable income require significant judgment and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses in evaluating the objective evidence that historical results provide we consider three years of cumulative operating income 

costs and pricing 

inflationary trends in recent years have been moderate current inventory costs the increasing costs of equipment and other costs are considered in establishing sales pricing policies the company emphasizes cost containment in all aspects of its business 

hedging activities market risk disclosures 

teledyne transacts business in various foreign currencies and has international sales and expenses denominated in foreign currencies subjecting the company to foreign currency risk the company’s primary objective is to protect the united states dollar value of future cash flows and minimize the volatility of reported earnings following the acquisition of dalsa the company began to utilize foreign currency forward contracts to reduce the volatility of cash flows primarily related to forecasted revenue and expenses denominated in canadian dollars these contracts are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges 

the effectiveness of the cash flow hedge contracts excluding time value is assessed prospectively and retrospectively on a monthly basis using regression analysis as well as using other timing and probability criteria to receive hedge accounting treatment all hedging relationships are formally documented at the inception of the hedges and must be highly effective in offsetting changes to future cash flows on hedged transactions the effective portion of the cash flow hedge contracts’ gains or losses resulting from changes in the fair value of these hedges is initially reported net of tax as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income  “ aoci ”  in stockholders’ equity until the underlying hedged item is 

reflected in our consolidated statements of income at which time the effective amount in accumulated other comprehensive income is reclassified to cost of sales in our consolidated statements of income the company expects to reclassify a loss of approximately 14 million over the next 12 months based on the year end 2013 exchange rate 

in the event that the gains or losses in aoci are deemed to be ineffective the ineffective portion of gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value if any is reclassified to other income and expense in the event that the underlying forecasted transactions do not occur or it becomes remote that they will occur within the defined hedge period the gains or losses on the related cash flow hedges will be reclassified from aoci to other income and expense during the current reporting period all forecasted transactions occurred and therefore there were no such gains or losses reclassified to other income and expense as of december 29 2013  teledyne had foreign currency forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges to buy canadian dollars and to sell us dollars totaling 707 million  and these contracts had a negative fair value of 12 million  these foreign currency forward contracts have maturities ranging from march 2014 to february 2015 

in addition the company utilizes foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate foreign exchange rate risk associated with foreigncurrencydenominated monetary assets and liabilities including intercompany receivables and payables and as of december 29 2013  teledyne had foreign currency contracts of this type in the following currency pairs in millions 



these contracts had a negative fair value of 07 million  at december 29 2013  the gains and losses on these derivatives which are not designated as hedging instruments under asc 815 derivatives and hedging are intended to at a minimum partially offset the transaction gains and losses recognized in earnings all derivatives are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value as discussed below the accounting for gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value depends on the use of the derivative and whether it is designated and qualifies for hedge accounting teledyne does not use foreign currency forward contracts for speculative or trading purposes 

notwithstanding our efforts to mitigate portions of our foreign currency exchange rate risks there can be no assurance that our hedging activities will adequately protect us against the risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations a hypothetical 10 appreciation of the us dollar from its value at december 29 2013  would decrease the fair value of our foreign currency forward contracts associated with our cash flow hedging activities by 71 million  a hypothetical 10 depreciation of the us dollar from its value at december 29 2013  would increase the fair value of our foreign currency forward contracts associated with our cash flow hedging activities by 71 million  

borrowings under our credit facility are at fixed rates that vary with the term and timing of each loan under the facility loans under the facility typically have terms of one two three or six months and the interest rate for each such loan is subject to change if the loan is continued or converted following the applicable maturity date interest rates are also subject to change based on our debt to earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization ratio as of december 29 2013  we had 742 million  outstanding indebtedness under our 7500 million credit facility any borrowings under the company’s revolving credit line are based on a fluctuating market interest rate and consequently the fair value of any outstanding debt should not be affected materially by changes in market interest rates a 100 basis point increase in interest rates would result in an increase in annual interest expense of approximately 07 million  assuming the 742 million  in debt was outstanding for the full year 

we believe that adequate controls are in place to monitor any hedging activities our primary exposure to market risk relates to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates we periodically evaluate these risks and have taken measures to mitigate these risks we own assets and operate facilities in countries that have been politically stable

some of the company’s products are subject to specified warranties and the company provides for the estimated cost of product warranties we regularly assess the adequacy of our preexisting warranty liabilities and adjust amounts as necessary based on a review of historic warranty experience with respect to the applicable business or products as well as the length and actual terms of the warranties which are typically one year the product warranty reserve is included in current accrued liabilities and other longterm liabilities on the balance sheet changes in the company’s product warranty reserve are as follows in millions 



critical accounting policies 

the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with united states generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the notes to the financial statements some of those judgments can be subjective and complex and therefore actual results could differ materially from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions our critical accounting policies are those that are reflective of significant judgment complexity and uncertainty and may potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions we have identified the following as critical accounting policies revenue recognition accounting for pension plans accounting for business combinations goodwill and other longlived assets and accounting for income taxes for additional discussion of the application of these and other accounting policies see note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition 

commercial sales and sales from us government fixedprice type contracts are generally recorded as shipments are made or as services are rendered revenue related to a product or service is recognized when products are shipped to the customer or services have been rendered in accordance with terms of an agreement of sale under which title and risk of loss have been transferred collectability is reasonably assured and pricing is fixed or determinable the company’s typical terms of sale are fob shipping point and as such the company primarily records revenue for product sales upon shipment for the very small percentage of sales where title and risk of loss passes at point of delivery the company recognizes revenue upon delivery to the customer assuming all other criteria for revenue recognition are met for contracts that require the company to warehouse certain goods revenue is recognized when all risks of loss is borne by the customer and all other criteria for revenue recognition are met if any significant obligation to the customer with respect to a sales transaction remains to be fulfilled following shipment typically involving acceptance by the buyer revenue recognition is deferred until such obligations have been fulfilled following shipment the company does not offer substantial sales incentives and credits to customers accruals for sales returns and other allowances are provided at the time revenue is recognized based upon past experience a small percentage of our revenues involve multiple deliverables which require us to determine the fair value of each deliverable and then allocate the total arrangement consideration among the separate deliverables based on the relative fair value percentages also extended or noncustomary warranties do not represent a significant portion of our revenue however when our revenue 

arrangements include an extended or noncustomary warranty provision the revenue is deferred and recognized over the extended warranty coverage period 

for certain fixedprice type contracts that require substantial performance over a long time period generally one or more years revenues are recorded under the percentageofcompletion method  “ poc ”  we measure the extent of progress toward completion using the unitsofdelivery method costtocost method or upon attainment of scheduled performance milestones which could be time event or expense driven occasionally invoices are submitted to and paid by the customer under a contractual agreement which has a different time schedule than the related revenue recognition sales under costreimbursement contracts usually from the us government are recorded as allowable costs are incurred and fees are earned the percentage of company sales recognized using the poc method has been decreasing and was 321  in 2013  367  in 2012  and 394  in 2011  due to the increase in our commercial business which does not typically utilize the poc method 

the development of cost of sales percentages used to record costs under certain fixedprice type contracts and fees under certain costreimbursement type contracts accounted for under the poc method of accounting requires management’s judgment to make reasonably dependable cost estimates for the design manufacture and delivery of products and services generally over a long time period since certain fixedprice and costreimbursement type contracts extend over a long period of time the impact of revisions in cost and revenue estimates during the progress of work may adjust the current period earnings on a cumulative catchup basis this method recognizes in the current period the cumulative effect of the changes on current and prior quarters for fixedprice contracts if the current contract estimate indicates a loss a provision is made for the total anticipated loss in the period that it becomes evident contract cost and revenue estimates for significant contracts are generally reviewed and reassessed quarterly these types of contracts and estimates are most frequently related to our sales to the us government or sales to other defense contractors for ultimate sale to the us government changes in estimates related to contracts accounted for under the poc method are recorded using the cumulative catchup method of accounting the net effect of these favorable and unfavorable changes in estimates were expense of 18 million  in 2013  and 12 million  in 2012  and 03 million  of income in 2011  the aggregate effects of these favorable and unfavorable changes in estimates in 2013  2012  and 2011  were 214 million  180 million  and 47 million  of favorable operating income and 232 million  192 million  and 44 million  of unfavorable operating income respectively we do not believe that any discrete event or adjustments to an individual contract within the aggregate changes in contract estimates for 2013  2012  or 2011  was material to the consolidated statements of income for such annual periods 

accounting for pension plans 

teledyne has a defined benefit pension plan covering substantially all us employees hired before january 1 2004 or approximately 20  of teledyne’s active employees as of january 1 2004 new hires participate in a defined contribution plan in connection with recent acquisitions the company assumed responsibility for several smaller foreignbased benefit pension plans the benefit obligation for the domestic defined benefit pension plan totaled 7689 million at december 29 2013 and the fair value of the net plan assets were 9862 million at december 29 2013 the benefit obligation for the foreignbased pension plans totaled 603 million at december 29 2013 and the fair value of the net plan assets were 522 million at december 29 2013 the company’s accounting for its defined benefit pension plan requires that amounts recognized in financial statements be determined on an actuarial basis rather than as contributions are made to the plan a significant element in determining the company’s pension income or expense is the expected return on plan assets as well as the assumed discount rate on pension liabilities the company has assumed based upon the types of securities the plan assets are invested in and the longterm historical returns of these investments that the longterm expected return on pension assets will be 825  in 2014 for its domestic pension plan and the assumed discount rate will be 54  in 2014 for its domestic pension plan the company’s longterm expected return on pension assets used in 2013  was 825 for its domestic pension plans and the assumed discount rate used in 2013  was 44 the actual rate of return on pension assets was 196   in 2013  and 139 in 2012  for its domestic pension plan if the actual rate of return on pension assets is above the projection the company may be able to reduce its contributions to the pension trust if the actual rate of return on pension assets is below the projection the company may be required to make additional contributions to the pension trust the company made voluntary pretax cash contributions of 830 million  to its domestic pension benefit plan in 2013  and made a voluntary pretax cash contribution of 928 million  in 2012  before recovery from the us government the assumed longterm rate of return on assets is applied to the marketrelated value of net plan assets at the end of the previous year the marketrelated value of plan assets is a smoothed value where investment gains and losses have been smoothed over five years this produces the expected return on plan assets that is included in the annual pension income or expense calculation for the current year the cumulative difference between this expected return and the actual return on plan assets is deferred and amortized into pension income or expense over future periods at yearend 2013  the company has a 1332 million  noncash reduction to stockholders’ equity and a longterm additional liability of 2140 million  related to its pension plans at yearend 2012  the company had a 2571 million  noncash reduction to stockholders’ equity and a longterm additional liability of 4186 million  related to its pension plans see note 12 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional pension disclosures 

differences in the discount rate and expected longterm rate of return on assets within the indicated range would have had the following impact on 2013  pension expense in millions 



see note 12 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional pension disclosures 

accounting for business combinations goodwill acquired intangible assets and other longlived assets 

the results for all acquisitions are included in the company’s consolidated financial statements from the date of each respective acquisition business acquisitions are accounted for under the purchase method by assigning the purchase price to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at their fair values and the excess of the purchase price over the amounts assigned is recorded as goodwill purchased intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives adjustments to fair value assessments are recorded to goodwill over the purchase price allocation period 

goodwill and acquired intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized we review goodwill and acquired indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable the company also performs an annual impairment test in the fourth quarter of each year we would test goodwill and acquired indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment between annual tests if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce our enterprise fair value below its book value these events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate including a significant sustained decline in an entity’s market value legal factors operating performance indicators competition sale or disposition of a significant portion of the business or other factors based on the annual impairment test completed in the fourth quarter of 2013  the company recorded a 12 million asset impairment related to acquired intangible assets no impairment of goodwill was indicated 

for goodwill impairment testing the company estimates the fair value of the reporting units using a discounted cash flow model based on our best estimate of amounts and timing of future revenues and cash flows and our most recent business and strategic plans and compares the estimated fair value to the carrying value of the reporting unit including goodwill the discounted cash flow model requires judgmental assumptions about projected revenue growth future operating margins discount rates and terminal values there are inherent uncertainties related to these assumptions and managements judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill impairment while the company believes it has made reasonable estimates and assumptions to calculate the fair value of its reporting units it is possible a material change could occur if actual results are not consistent with management’s estimates and assumptions goodwill may be overstated and a charge would need to be taken against net earnings 

as of december 29 2013  the company had 30 reporting units for goodwill impairment testing the carrying value of goodwill included in the company’s individual reporting units ranges from 02 million to 2291 million the company’s analysis in 2013 indicated that in all instances the fair value of the company’s reporting units exceeded their carrying values and consequently did not result in an impairment charge the excess of the estimated fair value over the carrying value expressed as a percentage of carrying value of the respective reporting unit for each of the company’s reporting units as of the fourth quarter of 2013 the annual testing date ranged from approximately 83 to 2604 

changes in these projections could affect the estimated fair value of certain of the company’s reporting units and could result in a goodwill impairment charge in a future period in order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations used in the goodwill impairment test the company applied a hypothetical 10 decrease to the fair values of each reporting unit and compared those values to the reporting unit carrying values based on this sensitivity analysis the company did not identify any goodwill impairment charges 

the impairment test for indefinitelived intangibles other than goodwill primarily trademarks and trade names consists of a comparison of the fair value of the indefinitelived intangible asset to the carrying value of the asset as of the impairment testing date the company estimates the fair value of its indefinitelived intangibles using a discounted cash flow model based on our best estimate of amounts and timing of future revenues and cash flows and our most recent business and strategic plans and compares the estimated fair value to the carrying value of the asset the estimated fair values exceed the carrying value for each of the company’s indefinitelived intangible assets as of the fourth quarter of 2013  the annual testing date except for the 12 million asset impairment related to an acquired intangible asset in 2013 

accounting for income taxes 

income tax expense and deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect management’s assessment of actual future taxes to be paid on items reflected in the financial statements significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes uncertainty exists regarding tax positions taken in previously filed tax returns still under examination and positions expected to be taken in the current year and future returns deferred tax assets and liabilities arise due to differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and tax carryforwards although we believe our income tax expense and deferred tax assets and liabilities are reasonable no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome will not be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals to the extent that the final tax outcome is different than the amounts recorded such differences will impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made the provision for income taxes includes the impact of uncertain tax benefits that are considered appropriate as well as the related net interest 

significant judgment is required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets in assessing the need for a valuation allowance we consider all available evidence including past operating results estimates of future taxable income and the feasibility of tax planning strategies in the event that we change our determination as to the amount of deferred tax assets that can be realized we will adjust our valuation allowance with a corresponding impact to the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made 

our effective tax rates differ from the us statutory rate primarily due to the tax impact of net discrete tax benefits including prior year research and development tax credits state taxes tax audit settlements and non us subsidiaries taxed at rates less than the 35 us statutory rate the effective tax rate was 177  287  and 329  in 2013  2012  and 2011  respectively 

we record uncertain tax positions on the basis of a twostep process whereby 1 we determine whether it is more likely than not that the tax positions will be sustained on the basis of the technical merits of the position and 2 for those tax positions that meet the morelikelythannot recognition threshold we recognize the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50 percent likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement with the related tax authority 

the following presents a rollforward of our unrecognized tax benefits in millions 



we recognized tax benefits for interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits of 22 million  within the provision for income taxes in our statements of operations for 2013 compared with expense of 27 million  for 2012 interest and penalties in the amount of 34 million in 2013 and 58 million in 2012 were recognized in the statement of financial position 

as of december 29 2013  we estimated that 309 million of unrecognized tax benefits if resolved in our favor would positively impact the effective tax rate and therefore be recognized as additional tax benefits in our income statement since the 354 million of unrecognized tax benefits would be offset by 45 million in deferred tax assets 

we file income tax returns in the united states federal jurisdiction and in various states and foreign jurisdictions the company has substantially concluded on all us federal income tax matters for all years through 2009 california income tax matters for all years through 2006 and canadian income tax matters for all years through 2005 the company is currently under audit in california for tax periods 2007 through 2009 the company does not believe that the resolution of any of the audits will have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations substantially all other material state local and foreign income tax matters have been concluded for years through 2008 

the company anticipates the total unrecognized tax benefit for various federal and state tax items may be reduced by 83 million due to the expiration of statutes of limitation and settlements with tax authorities for various federal state and canadian tax issues in the next 12 months 

recent accounting pronouncements 

in july 2012 the financial accounting standards board  “ fasb ”  issued accounting guidance on the testing of indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment the guidance allows entities to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine the likelihood of an impairment for an indefinitelived intangible asset and whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative impairment assessment currently required this guidance is effective for annual and interim impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after september 15 2012 teledyne’s adoption of these provisions effective december 31 2012 did not have an impact on our financial position or results of operations 

in july 2013 the fasb issued accounting guidance related to the presentation of an unrecognized tax benefit when a net operating loss carryforward  “nol”  a similar tax loss or a tax credit carryforward exists under the guidance an entity will be required to present an unrecognized tax benefit as a reduction of a deferred tax asset for a nol or tax credit carryforward whenever the nol or tax credit carryforward would be available to reduce the additional taxable income or tax due if the tax position is disallowed an entity is required to apply the amendments prospectively for annual reporting periods beginning after december 15 2013 the company is currently evaluating the guidance but does not anticipate that the implementation of this guidance will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements 

safe harbor cautionary statement regarding forwardlooking information 

this management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation contains forwardlooking statements as defined in the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 directly and indirectly relating to earnings growth opportunities product sales capital expenditures pension matters stock option compensation expense the credit facility interest expense severance and relocation costs stock repurchases taxes and strategic plans all statements made in this management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation that are not historical in nature should be considered forwardlooking actual results could differ materially from these forwardlooking statements many factors could change the anticipated results including disruptions in the global economy changes in demand for products sold to the defense electronics instrumentation digital imaging energy exploration and production commercial aviation semiconductor and communications markets funding continuation and award of government programs and cuts to defense spending resulting from future deficit reduction measures including potential automatic cuts to defense spending that have been triggered by the budget control act of 2011 as amended by the bipartisan budget act of 2013 increasing fuel costs could negatively affect the markets of our commercial aviation businesses lower oil and natural gas prices as well as instability in the middle east or other oil producing regions and new regulations or restrictions relating to energy production including with respect to hydraulic fracturing could negatively affect our businesses that supply the oil and gas industry in addition financial market fluctuations affect the value of our pension assets 

changes in the policies of us and foreign governments could result over time in reductions and realignment in defense or other government spending and further changes in programs in which the company participates 

while teledyne’s growth strategy includes possible acquisitions we cannot provide any assurance as to when if or on what terms any acquisitions will be made acquisitions involve various inherent risks such as among others our ability to integrate acquired businesses retain customers and achieve identified financial and operating synergies there are additional risks associated with acquiring owning and operating businesses outside of the united states including those arising from us and foreign government policy changes or actions and exchange rate fluctuations 

while we believe our control systems are effective there are inherent limitations in all control systems and misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and may not be detected 

additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in the forwardlooking statements is contained beginning on page 13 of this form 10k under the caption “risk factors cautionary statement as to forwardlooking statements” forwardlooking statements are generally accompanied by words such as “estimate” “project” “predict” “believes” or “expect” that convey the uncertainty of future events or outcomes we assume no obligation to publicly update or revise any forwardlooking statements whether as a result of new information or otherwise

customers 

we have hundreds of customers in the various industries we serve no commercial customer accounted for more than 10 of our total sales during 2012 2011 or 2010 our largest commercial customer a customer of our instrumentation segment accounted for 34 29 and 35 of total sales in 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively 

sales to international customers accounted for approximately 39  of total sales in 2012  compared with 36  in 2011  and 29  in 2010  in 2012  we sold products to customers in over 100 foreign countries approximately 90 percent of our sales to foreign customers were made to customers in 24 foreign countries the 2012  top five countries for international sales were the united kingdom norway china germany and japan and constituted approximately 19 of our total sales 

approximately 32  36  and 44  of our total sales for 2012  2011  and 2010  respectively were derived from contracts with agencies of and prime contractors to the us government information on our sales to the us government including direct sales as a prime contractor and indirect sales as a subcontractor is as follows in millions 



our principal us government customer is the us department of defense these sales represented 26  29  and 34  of our total sales for 2012  2011  and 2010  respectively in both 2012  and 2011 our largest program with the us government was the systems development and operations support contract with nasas marshall space flight center which represented 19 of our total sales in both years in 2010 our largest program with the us government was the systems engineering and technical assistance contract with the space and missile defense command and it represented 34 of then total sales 

as described on pages 13 through 15 there are risks associated with doing business with the us government in 2012  approximately 59  of our us government prime contracts and subcontracts were fixedprice type contracts compared to 60  in 2011  and 54  in 2010  under these types of contracts we bear the inherent risk that actual performance cost may exceed the fixed contract price such contracts are typically not subject to renegotiation of profits if we fail to anticipate technical problems estimate costs accurately or control costs during performance additionally us government contracts are subject to termination by the us government at its convenience without identification of any default when contracts are terminated for convenience we typically recover costs incurred or committed settlement expenses and profit on work completed prior to termination we had six us government contracts terminated for convenience in 2012  compared to seven in 2011  and two in 2010  

our total backlog of confirmed orders was approximately 9525 million  at december 30 2012  compared with 9446 million  at january 1 2012  and 8638 million  at december 31 2010  we expect to fulfill 99  of such backlog of confirmed orders during 2013 

raw materials and suppliers 

generally our businesses have experienced minimal fluctuations in the supply of raw materials but not without some price volatility while some of our businesses provide services for those businesses that sell hardware and product a portion of the value that we provide is labor oriented such as design engineering assembly and test activities in manufacturing our 

products we use our own production capabilities and also third party suppliers and subcontractors including international sources some of the items we purchase for the manufacture of our products including certain gyro components for some marine navigation applications certain magnets and helix wire for our traveling wave tubes and certain infrared detectors substrates as well as certain scintillator materials use in the production of our xray detectors are purchased from limited or single sources including international sources due to technical capability price and other factors while over the years we have not experienced much difficulty in procuring raw materials components subassemblies and other supplies required in our manufacturing processes continuing disruption in the global economy and financial markets could trigger increased pricing and otherwise affect our suppliers as well as our ability to procure some supplies 

sales and marketing 

our sales and marketing approach varies by segment and by products within our segments a shared fundamental tenet is the commitment to work closely with our customers to understand their needs with an aim to secure preferred supplier and longerterm relationships 

our segments use a combination of internal sales forces distributors and commissioned sales representatives to market and sell our products and services our teledyne instruments companies and other businesses have been working over the years to consolidate or share internal sales and servicing efforts several teledyne businesses have been marketing and selling products collaboratively to similar customers to promote “onestop” shopping under singular “brand” names including teledyne oil  gas teledyne marine teledyne nuclear teledyne water quality and teledyne microwave solutions 

products are also advertised in appropriate trade journals and by means of various websites to promote our products and other capabilities our personnel regularly participate in relevant trade shows and professional associations 

many of our government contracts are awarded after a competitive bidding process in which we seek to emphasize our ability to provide superior products and technical solutions in addition to competitive pricing 

through teledyne technologies international corp and other subsidiaries the company has established offices in foreign countries to facilitate international sales for various businesses locations include brazil china france germany italy japan malaysia singapore south korea switzerland and the united arab emirates 

competition 

we believe that technological capabilities and innovation and the ability to invest in the development of new and enhanced products are critical to obtaining and maintaining leadership in our markets and the industries in which we compete although we have certain advantages that we believe help us compete effectively in our markets each of our markets is highly competitive because of the diversity of products sold and the number of markets we serve we encounter a wide variety of competitors our businesses vigorously compete on the basis of quality product performance and reliability technical expertise price and service many of our competitors have and potential competitors could have greater name recognition a larger installed base of products more extensive engineering manufacturing marketing and distribution capabilities and greater financial technological and personnel resources than we do 

  

research and development 

our research and development efforts primarily involve engineering and design related to improving products and developing new products and technologies in the same or similar fields we spent a total of 3642 million  in 2012 3157 million  in 2011 and 3199 million  in 2010 on research and development and bid and proposal costs customerfunded research and development most of which was attributable to work under contracts with the us government represented approximately 64  of total research and development costs for 2012 compared with 68  in 2011 and 81  in 2010 

in 2012 we incurred 1316 million  in companyfunded research and development and bid and proposal costs we expect the level of companyfunded research and development and bid and proposal costs to be approximately 1571 million in 2013 

intellectual property 

while we own and control various intellectual property rights including patents trade secrets confidential information trademarks trade names and copyrights which in the aggregate are of material importance to our business we believe that our business as a whole is not materially dependent upon any one intellectual property or related group of such properties we own several hundred active patents and are licensed to use certain patents technology and other intellectual property rights owned and controlled by others similarly other companies are licensed to use certain patents technology and other intellectual property rights owned and controlled by us 

patents patent applications and license agreements will expire or terminate over time by operation of law in accordance with their terms or otherwise we do not expect the expiration or termination of these patents patent applications and license agreements to have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

employees 

we consider our relations with our employees to be good our total current workforce consists of approximately 9630 employees of which approximately 7200 employees are located in the united states

risk factors cautionary statement as to forwardlooking statements 

the following text highlights various risks and uncertainties associated with teledyne these factors could materially affect “forwardlooking statements” within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 that we may from time to time make including forwardlooking statements contained in “item 1 business” and “item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” of this form 10k and in teledynes 2012 annual report to stockholders it is not possible for management to predict all such factors and new factors may emerge additionally management cannot assess the impact of each such factor on teledyne or the extent to which any factor or combination of factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forwardlooking statements 

  

a new global recession continued economic uncertainty in europe or an economic downturn in china may adversely affect us 

if another global recession emerges if economic uncertainty in europe continues or worsens or if economic growth in china substantially slows we may experience declines in revenues profitability and cash flows from reduced orders payment 

delays collection difficulties increased price pressures for our products increased risk of excess and obsolete inventories or other factors caused by the economic problems of customers if negative conditions in the global credit markets prevent our customers access to credit or render them insolvent orders for our products may decrease which would result in lower revenue likewise if our suppliers face challenges in obtaining credit in selling their products or otherwise in operating their businesses or remaining solvent they may become unable to offer the materials we use to manufacture our products these events could adversely impact our ability to manufacture affected products and could also result in reductions in our revenue increased price competition and increased operating costs which could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we develop and manufacture products for customers in the energy exploration and production markets domestic and international commercial aerospace markets the semiconductor industry consumer electronics and the automotive industry each of which has been cyclical and suffered from fluctuating market demands a cyclical downturn in these markets may materially affect future operating results 

in addition we sell products and services to customers in industries that are sensitive to the level of general economic activity and consumer spending habits and in more mature industries that are sensitive to capacity adverse economic conditions affecting these industries may reduce demand for our products and services which may reduce our revenues profits or production levels some of our businesses serve industries such as power generation and petrochemical refining which may be negatively impacted by reductions in global capital expenditures and manufacturing capacity 

our dependence on revenue from government contracts subjects us to many risks 

our revenue from government contracts depends on the continued availability of funding from the us government and accordingly we have the risk that funding for our existing contracts may be canceled or diverted to other uses or delayed 

we perform work on a number of contracts with the department of defense and other agencies and departments of the us government including subcontracts with government prime contractors sales under contracts with the us government as a whole including sales under contracts with the department of defense as prime contractor or subcontractor represented approximately 32  of our total revenue in 2012 as compared with 36  in 2011 and 44  in 2010 performance under government contracts has inherent risks that could have a material effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

government contracts are conditioned upon the continuing availability of congressional appropriations and the failure of congress to appropriate funds for programs in which we participate could negatively affect our results of operations the failure by congress to approve budgets on a timely basis could delay procurement of our services and products and cause us to lose future revenues the us governments inability to complete its budget process or to fund government operations pursuant to a continuing resolution may result in a us government shutdown which could result in a material loss of revenues for us us defense spending is expected to decline in some areas over the next few years a continued emphasis on federal deficit and debt reduction could lead to a decrease in overall defense spending the continued war on terrorism and a winding down of the iraq and afghanistan wars also could result in a diversion of funds from programs in which teledyne participates budgetary concerns could result in future contracts being awarded more on price than on other competitive factors and smaller defense budgets could result in more intense competition on programs which could result in lower revenues and profits 

the sequestration provision of the budget control act of 2011 would impose 500 billion of defense cuts over nine years starting in fiscal year 2013 which represents approximately 9 percent of planned defense funding over the period if sequestration is triggered the fiscal year 2013 defense budget could be lowered by as much as 40 to 50 billion or approximately 9 percent how these reductions would be implemented has not been defined congress recently extended the deadline for resolving sequestration to march 1 2013 we are unable to predict the impact that sequestration or other defense spending cuts would have on funding for defense programs in which we participate however the reductions could have a material adverse impact on our business if they are implemented in addition uncertainty related to ongoing fiscal debates in congress and the threat of sequestration if it continues to be unresolved could result in our government and defense contractor customers delaying orders or payments or reducing spending on programs in which we participate 

continued defense spending does not necessarily correlate to continued business for us because not all of the programs in which we participate or have current capabilities may be provided with continued funding changes in policy and budget priorities by the president his administration and our congress for various defense and nasa programs could continue to impact our engineered systems and aerospace and defense electronics segments for example changes in national space policy that affect nasas budget have occurred there have also been significant reductions in missile defense budgets we anticipate continuing scrutiny of those budgets to impact our revenues our engineered systems segment may be further impacted by delays in production funding on the joint airtosurface standoff missile “jassm” program and a possible reduction of continued production runs under the harpoon missile program the timing of program cycles can also affect our results of operations for a particular quarter or year it is not uncommon for the department of defense to delay the timing of awards for major programs for six to twelve months or more beyond the original projected timeframe reductions and delays in research and development funding by the us government may continue to impact our revenues as the defense advanced research projects agency referred to as darpa reviews its programs aimed to enhance technologically us military capabilities and national security changes to the darpa research and technology development programs in which we participate could occur finally various department of defense initiatives such as the emphasis on insourcing positions to the government and anticipated reductions or cancellations of existing programs could negatively impact our engineered systems segment 

our participation in government programs may decrease or be subject to renegotiation as those programs evolve over time 

the us government has been placing emphasis on small business quotas and increasing small business contract set asides and minimum work percentages in some cases prime contractors are required to reduce participation by large subcontractors like teledyne in order to fill small business quotas and be responsive to proposals and bids as a result our engineered systems segment could be significantly impacted 

over time and for a variety of reasons programs can evolve and affect the extent of our participation for example teledyne brown engineering incs groundbased midcourse defense program was negatively impacted by both the nominal end date of development activity and the change in focus of the current administration relative to missile defense 

we have been a significant participant in nasa programs primarily through our engineered systems segment and through teledyne scientific company the current administration introduced significant changes to the national space policy including the cancellation of the nasas constellation program which includes ares launch vehicles the administration plans to utilize commercial launch vehicles for crew and cargo iss expeditions and develop a nasa heavy lift launch vehicle for space exploration as a result of these changes we have been attempting to transition our business to meet the needs of the new policy and programs with the further understanding that the existing international space station will continue to be fully functional and supported and that the us will continue investment in human space flight failure to transition our business successfully could result in reduced sales in addition delayed funding and lack of clear focus and support for nasas new space policy could negatively impact our business 

our contracts with the us government are subject to termination rights that could adversely affect us 

most of our us government contracts are subject to termination by the us government either at its convenience or upon the default of the contractor termination for convenience provisions provide only for the recovery of costs incurred or committed settlement expenses and profit on work completed prior to termination termination for default clauses impose liability on the contractor for excess costs incurred by the us government in reprocuring undelivered items from another source we had six us government contracts terminated for convenience in 2012 compared with seven in 2011 and two in 2010 no contracts were terminated for default during such threeyear period 

we may lose money or generate less than expected profits on our fixedprice government contracts and we may lose money if we fail to meet certain prespecified targets in government contracts 

there is no guarantee that us government contracts will be profitable a number of our us government prime contracts and subcontracts are fixedprice type contracts  59  of our total us government contracts were fixedprice in 2012 60  in 2011 and 54  in 2010 under these types of contracts we bear the inherent risk that actual performance cost may 

exceed the fixed contract price under such contracts we must absorb cost overruns notwithstanding the difficulty of estimating all of the costs we will incur in performing these contracts we cannot assure that our contract loss provisions in our financial statements will be adequate to cover all actual future losses we may lose money on some contracts if we fail to meet these estimates 

our business is subject to government contracting regulations and our failure to comply with such laws and regulations could harm our operating results and prospects 

we like other government contractors are subject to various audits reviews and investigations including private party “whistleblower” lawsuits relating to our compliance with federal and state laws more routinely the us government may audit the costs we incur on our us government contracts including allocated indirect costs such audits could result in adjustments to our contract costs any costs found to be improperly allocated to a specific contract will not be reimbursed and such costs already reimbursed would need to be refunded we have recorded contract revenues based upon costs we expect to realize on final audit in a worst case scenario should a business or division involved be charged with wrongdoing or should the us government determine that the business or division is not a “presently responsible contractor” that business or division and conceivably our company as a whole could be temporarily suspended or in the event of a conviction could be debarred for up to three years from receiving new government contracts or governmentapproved subcontracts in addition we could expend substantial amounts defending against such charges and in damages fines and penalties if such charges were proven or were to result in negotiated settlements 

united states and global responses to terrorism the end of the war in iraq and the winding down of war in afghanistan continuing turmoil in middle eastern countries mexican border town violence concerns regarding nuclear proliferation and the safety of nuclear energy potential epidemics financial issues facing airlines and volatile energy prices increase uncertainties with respect to many of our businesses and may adversely affect our business and results of operations 

united states and global responses to terrorism the end of war in iraq and the winding down of war in afghanistan continuing turmoil in middle eastern countries mexican border town violence and nuclear proliferation concerns increase uncertainties with respect to us and other business and financial markets and could adversely affect our business and operations 

air travel declines have occurred after terrorist attacks and heightened security alerts as well as after the h1n1 virus sars and bird flu scares while travel by our sales and service personnel to various regions have been affected by such factors additional declines in air travel resulting from such factors and other factors could adversely affect the financial condition of many of our commercial airline and aircraft manufacturer customers and in turn could adversely affect our aerospace and defense electronics segment in addition a prolonged virus epidemic or pandemic or the threat thereof could result in worker absences lower productivity voluntary closure of our offices and manufacturing facilities disruptions in our supply chain travel restrictions on our employees and other disruptions to our businesses moreover health epidemics may force local health and government authorities to mandate the temporary closure of our offices and manufacturing facilities 

deterioration of financial performance of airlines could result in a reduction of discretionary spending for upgrades of avionics and inflight communications equipment which would adversely affect our aerospace and defense electronics segment 

higher oil prices could adversely affect commercial airlinerelated customers of our aerospace and defense electronics segment conversely lower oil prices could decrease oil exploration and petrochemical refining activities and hinder our marine and other instrumentation businesses in addition instability in the middle east or other oilproducing regions could adversely affect expansion plans of the oil and gas industry customers of our instrumentation and cable solutions businesses 

the fukushima daiichi nuclear incident in 2011 created uncertainty for our us nuclear market customers for new nuclear power plant construction this uncertainty could have an impact on investments in the nuclear market including investments associated with building enriched uranium plants which could have an adverse impact on our engineered systems segment 

acquisitions involve inherent risks that may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

our growth strategy includes acquisitions acquisitions involve various inherent risks such as 

 • the potential loss of key personnel of an acquired business 

 15 

• the distraction of management resulting from the need to integrate acquired businesses 

• increased competition for acquisition targets which may increase acquisition costs 

 • production delays associated with consolidating acquired facilities and manufacturing operations 

 • unanticipated changes in business and economic conditions affecting an acquired business 

  

while we conduct financial and other due diligence in connection with our acquisitions and generally seek some form of protection including indemnification from a seller and sometimes an escrow of a portion of the purchase price to cover potential issues such acquired companies may have weaknesses or liabilities that are not accurately assessed or brought to our attention at the time of the acquisition further indemnities or escrows may not fully cover such matters particularly matters identified after a closing 

as they have over the last few years acquisitions may also change the nature and level of various risks faced by teledyne for example the dalsa acquisition in 2011 and again the lecroy acquisition in 2012 increased the percentage of sales attributable to commercial customers as opposed to the us government these acquisitions coupled with our acquisitions of additional canadabased companies optech and varisystems also increased the percentage of revenues and expenses that arise from international sources and our consequently our exposure to us and foreign policy changes and exchange rate fluctuations additionally both dalsas and lecroys businesses have been more capital intensive than other teledyne businesses increasing teledynes capital requirements 

under sec rules teledyne must issue a report on managements assessment of the effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting the sec permits a limited timebased exclusion for acquisitions to give a company an opportunity to evaluate more fully the internal controls of acquired companies and correct deficiencies and institute new or additional internal controls our 2012 managements report specifically excludes from its scope and coverage our 2012 acquisitions of lecroy blueview varisystems pdm neptec and the majority interest in the parent company of optech allowing us additional time to evaluate existing internal controls and implement additional controls as appropriate with regard to future acquisitions we can provide no assurance that we will be able to provide a report that contains no significant deficiencies or material weaknesses with respect to these acquired companies or other acquisitions 

in connection with our acquisitions including ones which we do not complete we may incur significant transaction costs we are required to expense as incurred such transaction costs which may have an adverse impact on our quarterly financial results 

we are subject to the risks associated with international sales which could harm our business or results of operations 

during 2012 sales to international customers accounted for approximately 39  of our total revenues as compared to 36  in 2011 and 29  in 2010 we anticipate that future sales to international customers will continue to account for a significant and increasing percentage of our revenues particularly since business and growth plans for many teledyne businesses focus on sales outside of the united states including to emerging markets such as china and brazil the total 2012 top five countries for international sales were united kingdom norway china germany and japan constituting 19 of our total sales the 2011 dalsa acquisition and the 2012 lecroy acquisition each has contributed to greater international sales risks associated with international sales include 

 any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition exchange rate fluctuations may negatively affect the cost of our products to international customers and therefore reduce our competitive position with the 2011 acquisition of canadabased dalsa and the 2012 acquisitions of the majority interest in the parent company of optech and varisystems also canadabased volatility in the value of the canadian dollar relative to the 

us dollar or other foreign currencies could adversely affect the business operations and the financial condition of our digital imaging segment 

sales of our products and services internationally are subject to us and local government regulations and procurement policies and practices including regulations relating to importexport control violations of export control rules could result in suspension of our ability to export items from one or more businesses or the entire corporation depending on the scope of the suspension this could have a material effect on our ability to perform certain international contracts 

among other things we are subject to the us foreign corrupt practices act or fcpa which generally prohibits us companies and their intermediaries from bribing foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or keeping business or otherwise obtaining favorable treatment further in 2011 the united kingdom also implemented the uk bribery act which raised the bar for antibribery law enforcement and compliance relative to the fcpa any determination that we had violated the fcpa the uk bribery act or equivalent antibribery and corruption laws in countries in which we do business could result in sanctions that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations while we have procedures and compliance programs in place and conduct fcpa and other trainings we cannot provide assurance that our internal controls will always protect us from misconduct by our employees agents or business partners 

we face risks related to sales through distributors and other third parties that we do not control which could harm our business 

we sell a portion of our products through third parties such as distributors valueadded resellers and oems collectively “distributors” using third parties for distribution exposes teledyne to many risks including competitive pressure concentration credit risk and compliance risks we may rely on one or more key distributors for a product and the loss of these distributors could reduce our revenue distributor may face financial difficulties including bankruptcy which could harm our collection of accounts receivables and financial results violations of the fcpa or similar antibribery laws by distributors or other third party intermediaries could have a material impact on our business failing to manage risks related to our use of distributors may reduce sales increase expenses and weaken our competitive position 

our indebtedness and any failure to comply with our covenants that apply to our indebtedness could materially and adversely affect our business 

as of december 30 2012 we had 5439 million in total outstanding indebtedness this indebtedness included 2500 million in senior unsecured notes issued and sold in a private placement transaction in september 2010 2000 million in term loans obtained in october 2012 790 million under our 5500 million credit facility and 148 million in other debt our indebtedness could harm our business by among other things reducing the funds available to make new strategic acquisitions or reducing our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and market conditions our indebtedness exposes us to interest rate risk since a portion of our debt obligations are at variable rates our indebtedness could also have a material adverse effect on our business by increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions or a downturn in our business general adverse economic and industry conditions or a downturn in our business could result in our inability to repay this indebtedness in a timely manner we may also amend our current credit facility or enter into new credit facility we may also elect to raise other forms of debt capital depending on financial market and economic conditions 

product liability claims product recalls and field service actions could have a material adverse effect on our reputation business results of operations and financial condition and we may have difficulty obtaining product liability and other insurance coverage 

as a manufacturer and distributor of a wide variety of products including monitoring instruments products used in offshore oil and gas production products used in commercial aviation and medical devices our results of operations are susceptible to adverse publicity regarding the quality or safety of our products in part product liability claims challenging the safety of our products may result in a decline in sales for a particular product which could adversely affect our results of operations this could be the case even if the claims themselves are proven untrue or settled for immaterial amounts 

while we have general liability and other insurance policies concerning product liabilities we have selfinsured retentions or deductibles under such policies with respect to a portion of these liabilities awarded damages could be more than our accruals we could incur losses above the aggregate annual policy limit as well we cannot assure that for 2013 and in future years insurance carriers will be willing to renew coverage or provide new coverage for product liability 

product recalls can be expensive and tarnish our reputation and have a material adverse effect on the sales of our products 

we have been joined among a number of defendants often over 100 in lawsuits alleging injury or death as a result of exposure to asbestos also because of the prominent “teledyne” name we may continue to be mistakenly joined in lawsuits involving a company or business that was not assumed by us as part of our 1999 spinoff to date we have not incurred 

material liabilities in connection with these lawsuits however our historic insurance coverage including that of its predecessors may not fully cover such claims and the defense of such matters coverage typically depends on the year of purported exposure and other factors nonetheless we intend to vigorously defend our position against these claims 

certain gas generators historically manufactured by teledyne energy systems inc contained a sealed wetted asbestos component while the company has transitioned to a replacement material had placed warning labels on its products and took care in handling of this discontinued material by employees there is no assurance that the company will not face product liability or workers compensation claims involving this component 

our teledyne brown engineering incs laboratory in knoxville tennessee performs radiological analyses errors and omissions in analyses may occur our insurance coverage or indemnities may not be adequate to cover potential problems associated with faulty radiological analyses 

teledyne brown engineering inc and other teledyne companies manufacture components for customers in the nuclear power market including utilities and certain governmental entities certain liabilities associated with such products are covered by the price anderson act and other statutory and common law defenses and we have received indemnities from some of our customers however there is no assurance we will not face product liability claims related to such products or that our exposure will not exceed the amounts for which we have liability coverage or protection 

we cannot assure that we will not have additional product liability claims or that we will not recall any additional products 

our pension expense and the value of our pension assets are affected by factors outside of our control including the performance of plan assets the stock market interest rates and actuarial experience 

we have a defined benefit qualified pension plan covering most of our us employees hired prior to 2004 or approximately 22 of our active employees the value of the combined pension assets is currently less than our pension benefit obligation the accounting rules applicable to our qualified pension plan require that amounts recognized in the financial statements be determined on an actuarial basis rather than as contributions are made to the plan two significant elements in determining our pension income or pension expense are the expected return on plan assets and the discount rate used in projecting pension benefit obligations declines in the stock market and lower rates of return could increase required contributions to our qualified pension plan our investment strategy may not produce the expected returns if the credit financial or stock markets deteriorate any decreases or increases in market interest rates will affect the discount rate assumption used in projecting pension benefit obligations in 2012 in an effort to reduce the risks associated with our current and future domestic pension obligation we amended the pension plan to change the rate at which pension benefits accrue after february 29 2012 and offered and made lump sum payments to certain participants in the plan whose employment with teledyne had terminated in 2012 2011 and 2010 we have made voluntary pretax cash contributions totaling 1988 million to the domestic pension plan if and to the extent decreases in our pension assets are not offset by voluntary contributions recovered through future asset returns mitigated by an increase in the rate at which the benefit obligation is discounted or other actions our required cash contributions and pension expense could increase under the plans for additional discussion of pension matters see the discussion under “item 7 managements discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition” and notes 2 and 12 to notes to consolidated financial statements 

our future financial results could be adversely impacted by asset impairment charges 

under current accounting guidance we are required to test annually both acquired goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment based upon a fair value approach rather than amortizing them over time we have chosen to perform our annual impairment reviews of goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year we also are required to test goodwill for impairment between annual tests if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce our enterprise fair value below its book value these events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate including a significant sustained decline in an entitys market value legal factors operating performance indicators competition sale or disposition of a significant portion of the business or other factors if the fair market value is less than the carrying value including goodwill we could be required to record an impairment charge the valuation of reporting units requires judgment in estimating future cash flows discount rates and estimated product life cycles in making these judgments we evaluate the financial health of the business including such factors as industry performance changes in technology and operating cash flows as we have grown through acquisitions the amount of goodwill and net acquired intangible assets is significant compared with our total assets as a result the amount of any annual or interim impairment could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our reported financial results for the period in which the charge is taken we also may be required to record an earnings charge or incur unanticipated expenses if as a result of a change in strategy or other reason we were to determine the value of other assets had been impaired 

we may not have sufficient resources to fund all future research and development and capital expenditures or possible acquisitions 

in order to remain competitive we must make a substantial investment in research and development of new or enhanced products and continuously upgrade our process technology and manufacturing capabilities in september 2006 we acquired rockwell scientific company llc a provider of research and development services primarily in the areas of electronics optics information sciences and materials technologies and in 2011 and in 2012 we acquired dalsa and lecroy respectively each of which had historically made significant investments in research and development relative to total revenues with teledyne scientific company in our portfolio we have been actively promoting and funding joint research and development projects with other teledyne businesses including teledyne brown engineering inc teledyne reynolds inc and our teledyne oil  gas businesses and more recently dalsa and lecroy additionally some of our businesses are actively pursuing governmental support and funding for some of their research and development initiatives including dalsa with respect to its cmos image sensor development efforts nonetheless we may be unable to fund all of our research and development and capital investment needs or possible acquisitions our ability to raise additional capital will depend on a variety of factors some of which will not be within our control including the existence of bank and capital markets investor perceptions of us our businesses and the industries in which we operate and general economic conditions failure to successfully raise needed capital on a timely or costeffective basis could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition in addition if we fail to accurately predict future customer needs and preferences or fail to produce viable technologies we may invest heavily in research and development of products that do not lead to significant revenue which would adversely affect our profitability 

we may be unsuccessful in our efforts to increase our participation in new markets 

we intend to both adapt our existing technologies and develop new products to expand into new market segments we may be unsuccessful in accessing these and other new markets if our products do not meet our customers requirements as a result of changes in either technology and industry standards or because of actions taken by our competitors 

limitations in customer funding for applied research and development and technology insertion projects and government support for research and development expenditures may reduce our ability to apply our ongoing investments in some market areas 

  we may be unable to successfully introduce new and enhanced products in a timely and costeffective manner which could harm our growth and prospects 

our operating results depend in part on our ability to introduce new and enhanced products on a timely basis in order to improve our product development capabilities we purchased the research center that is now teledyne scientific company in 2006 and in 2011 we purchased dalsa which has access to a wellequipped mems research and development center successful product development and introduction depend on numerous factors including our ability to anticipate customer and market requirements changes in technology and industry standards our ability to differentiate our offerings from offerings of our competitors and market acceptance we may not be able to develop and introduce new or enhanced products in a timely and costeffective manner or to develop and introduce products that satisfy customer requirements 

our new products also may not achieve market acceptance or correctly address new industry standards and technological changes we may also lose any technological advantage to competitors if we fail to develop new products in a timely manner 

additionally new products may trigger increased warranty costs as such products are tested further by actual usage accelerated entry of new products to meet heightened market demand and competitive pressures may cause additional warranty costs as development and testing time periods might be accelerated or condensed 

technological change and evolving industry and regulatory standards could cause some of our products or services to become obsolete or noncompetitive 

the markets for some of our products and services are characterized by rapid technological development evolving industry standards changes in customer requirements and new product introductions and enhancements a faster than anticipated change in one or more of the technologies related to our products or services or in market demand for products or services based on a particular technology could result in faster than anticipated obsolescence of certain of our products or services and could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition currently accepted industry and regulatory standards are also subject to change which may contribute to the obsolescence of our products or services 

we may not be able to reduce the costs of our products to satisfy customers cost reduction mandates which could harm our sales or margins 

more and more customers continue to seek price reductions of our products while we continually work to reduce our manufacturing and other costs of our products without affecting product quality and reliability there is no assurance that we will be able to do so and do so in a timely manner to satisfy the pricing pressures of our customers cost reductions of raw materials and other components used in our products may be beyond our control depending on market credit and economic conditions customers may seek lower cost products from china and other developing countries where manufacturing costs are lower 

the airline industry is heavily regulated and if we fail to comply with applicable requirements our results of operations could suffer 

governmental agencies throughout the world including the us federal aviation administration or the faa prescribe standards and qualification requirements for aircraft components including virtually all commercial airline and general aviation products specific regulations vary from country to country although compliance with faa requirements generally satisfies regulatory requirements in other countries if any material authorization or approval qualifying us to supply our products is revoked or suspended then the sale of the product would be prohibited by law which would have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

from time to time the faa or equivalent regulatory agencies in other countries propose new regulations or changes to existing regulations which are usually more stringent than existing regulations if these proposed regulations are adopted and enacted we may incur significant additional costs to achieve compliance which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

increasing competition could reduce the demand for our products and services 

each of our markets is highly competitive many of our competitors have and potential competitors could have greater name recognition a larger installed base of products more extensive engineering manufacturing marketing and distribution capabilities and greater financial technological and personnel resources than we do new or existing competitors may also develop new technologies that could adversely affect the demand for our products and services industry acquisition and consolidation trends particularly among aerospace and defense contractors have adversely impacted demand for our aerospace and defense related engineering services as large prime contractors insource increased amounts of major acquisition programs and also require significant expansion in small business participation to meet government contracting goals lowcost competition from china and other developing countries could also result in decreased demand for our products increasing competition could reduce the volume of our sales or the prices we may charge which would negatively impact our revenues smaller defense budgets both in the united states and europe could result in additional competition for new and existing defense programs 

we sell products to customers in industries that may again undergo rapid and unpredictable changes which could adversely affect our operations results or production levels 

we develop and manufacture products for customers in industries that have undergone rapid changes in the past including the semiconductor and the telecommunications industries in 2009 dalsa experienced a significant decline in demand for its products for the semiconductor and electronics inspection industries these industries or others that we serve may exhibit rapid changes in the future and may adversely affect our operating results or our production levels or both 

our business and financial results could be adversely affected by conditions and other factors associated with our suppliers 

some items we purchase for the manufacture of our products are purchased from limited or single sources of supply due to technical capability price and other factors for example dalsa has a single source of supply for ccd and cmos semiconductor wafers used to assemble image sensors and xray panel products lecroy currently outsources a portion of its research and development activities to a third party engineering firm in malaysia where it may be more difficult for us to enforce our intellectual property rights we have also outsourced from time to time the manufacturing of certain parts components subsystems and even finished products to single or limited sources including international sources disruption of these sources could cause delays or reductions in shipments of our products or increases in our costs which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or operations international sources possess additional risks some of which are similar to those described above in regard to international sales with any continuing disruption in the global economy and financial markets some of our suppliers may also continue to face issues gaining access to sufficient credit and materials to maintain their businesses which could reduce the availability of some components and to the extent such suppliers are single source suppliers could adversely affect our ability to continue to manufacture and sell our products continuing economic pressure on suppliers may also trigger increased pricing or workforce reductions or reduced workweeks possibly creating longer lead times 

to obtain needed components for our products 

some of our commercial product lines may have one or a limited number of customers the loss of which could adversely affect our business or financial results 

while no commercial customer accounted for more than 10 of our total sales during 2012 2011 and 2010 and we have hundreds of customers in the various industries that we serve certain product lines may have one or a few key customers the loss of which could adversely affect our business or financial results teledynes largest commercial customer a customer of our instrumentation segment accounted for 34 29 and 35 of total sales in 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively 

newer products such as our xray panel products may initially be more heavily dependent on a singular or limited number of customers until market acceptance is obtained or due to contractual terms similarly some older product lines may be more heavily dependent on a singular or limited number of customers in either such case the loss of such customer or customers could adversely affect our business or financial results 

compliance with increasing environmental and climate change regulations as well as the effects of potential environmental liabilities could have a material adverse financial effect on us 

we like other industry participants are subject to various federal state local and international environmental laws and regulations we may be subject to increasingly stringent environmental standards in the future particularly as greenhouse gas emissions and climate change regulations and initiatives increase future developments administrative actions or liabilities relating to environmental and climate change matters could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition additionally environmental regulations imposed on its customers including hydraulic fracturing moratoriums could continue to adversely affect the business of varisystems inc acquired in 2012 

our manufacturing operations could expose us to material environmental liabilities and companies we acquire may have environmental liabilities that are not accurately assessed or brought to our attention at the time of the acquisition 

for additional discussion of environmental matters see the discussion under the caption “other matters  environmental” of “item 7 managements discussion and analysis of results of operation and financial condition” and note 15 to notes to consolidated financial statements 

the us environmental protection agency announced that greenhouse gases “ghgs” threaten the public health and welfare of the american people epa also maintains that ghg emissions from onroad vehicles contribute to that threat epas endangerment finding covers emissions of six greenhouse gases epas efforts to limit ghg emissions could adversely affect our us manufacturing operations increase prices for energy fuel and transportation require us to accommodate changes in parameters such as the way parts are manufactured and may in some cases require us to redesign of certain products this could lead to increased costs which we may not be able to recover from customers delays in product shipments and loss of market share to competitors 

our inability to attract and retain key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our future success 

our future success depends to a significant extent upon the continued service of our executive officers and other key management and technical personnel and on our ability to continue to attract retain and motivate qualified personnel we also have a maturing work force while we have engaged in succession planning the loss of the services of one or more of our key employees or our failure to attract retain and motivate qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we may not be able to sell exit or reconfigure businesses that we determine no longer meet with our growth strategy 

consistent with our strategy to emphasize growth in our core markets we continually evaluate our businesses to ensure that they are aligned with our strategy this review led to the decision to sell our general aviation piston engine businesses which sale was completed in april 2011 in 2012 as a result of our review and declines in our electronic manufacturing services businesses we determined to close our teledyne microelectronics technologies facility in marina del rey california and began to relocate several of its product lines to other teledyne locations 

our ability to dispose of exit or reconfigure businesses that may no longer be aligned with our growth strategy will depend on many factors including the terms and conditions of any asset purchase and sale agreement as well as industry business and economic conditions we cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to sell nonstrategic businesses on terms that are acceptable to us or at all also if the sale of any nonstrategic business cannot be consummated or is not practical alternative courses of action including relocation of product lines or closure may not be available to us or may be more costly than anticipated 

natural and manmade disasters could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

several of our facilities as a result of their locations could be subject to a catastrophic loss caused by earthquakes hurricanes tornados floods ice storms or other natural disasters many of our production facilities and our headquarters are located in california and thus are in areas with above average seismic activity and may also be at risk of damage in wildfires teledyne dalsas facility in quebec has in the past been impacted by severe ice storms in addition we have manufacturing facilities in the southeastern united states and texas that have been threatened and struck by major hurricanes in october 2012 newly acquired lecroy and other teledyne facilities incurred business interruptions and were without power for several days as a result of hurricane sandy our facilities in alabama florida nebraska tennessee and virginia have also been threatened by tornados on june 1 2012 a tornado caused substantial damage to and interrupted business at our teledyne hastings instruments facility in hampton virginia on april 27 2011 tornados caused substantial damage in huntsville alabama while teledyne brown engineerings main facility in huntsville alabama incurred minimal building damage and business interruption the facility was without power for several days if any of our california facilities including our california headquarters were to experience a catastrophic earthquake or wildfire loss or if any of our alabama florida louisiana nebraska tennessee or texas facilities were to experience a catastrophic hurricane storm tornado or other natural disaster or if dalsas facilities in quebec experience longterm loss of electrical power such event could disrupt our operations delay production shipments and revenue and result in large expenses to repair or replace the facility or facilities while teledyne has property insurance to partially reimburse it for losses caused by windstorm and earth movement such insurance would not cover all possible losses in addition our existing disaster recovery and business continuity plans including those relating to our information technology systems may not be fully responsive to or minimize losses associated with catastrophic events 

the environmental disaster triggered by the deepwater horizon rig explosion and oil spill in 2010 resulted in a moratorium on offshore oil and gas production in the gulf of mexico that adversely affected the results of operations of some of our teledyne oil and gas businesses although such adverse impact was offset in part by the products we manufacture that supported wellcapping and environmental cleanup efforts new environmental regulations enacted in the wake of this oil spill have resulted in increased compliance costs to some of our teledyne oil  gas businesses similar future manmade disasters that limit or cease offshore oil and gas production or further exploration in the regions in which we sell our products could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

disasters that do not directly impact us can have an indirect adverse impact on our business for example in 2011 the earthquake in northern japan and the related tsunami and severe flooding in thailand resulted in certain of our customers delaying orders for our products because they were unable to obtain critical supplies from vendors in the impacted areas 

we may not be able to enforce or protect our intellectual property rights which may harm our ability to compete and harm our business 

our ability to enforce and protect our patents copyrights software licenses trade secrets know how and other intellectual property rights is subject to general litigation risks as well as uncertainty as to the enforceability of our intellectual property rights in various countries when we seek to enforce our rights we are often subject to claims that the intellectual property right is invalid is otherwise not enforceable or is licensed to the party against whom we are asserting a claim in addition as our teledyne controls business has experienced our assertion of intellectual property rights often results in the other party seeking to assert alleged intellectual property rights of its own or assert other claims against us if we are not ultimately successful in defending ourselves against these claims in litigation we may not be able to sell a particular product or family of products due to an injunction or we may have to pay damages that could in turn harm our results of operations our inability to enforce our intellectual property rights under these circumstances may harm our competitive position and our business 

our business and operations could suffer in the event of cyber security breaches 

attempts by others to gain unauthorized access to our information technology systems are becoming more sophisticated and are sometimes successful these attempts which might be related to industrial foreign government espionage or activism include covertly introducing malware to our computers and networks performing reconnaissance and impersonating authorized users among other activities we continue to update our infrastructure to protect against security incidents and to prevent their recurrence and company personnel have been tasked to detect and investigate such incidents but it is possible that we might not be aware of an incident or its magnitude and effects the theft unauthorized use or publication of our intellectual property andor confidential business information could harm our competitive position reduce the value of our investment in research and development and other strategic initiatives or otherwise adversely affect our business to the extent that any security breach results in inappropriate disclosure of confidential information of third parties or the government we may incur liability or the loss of security clearances as a result in addition we expect to continue devoting additional resources to the security of our information technology systems 

increases in our effective tax rate may harm our results of operations 

our effective tax rate for 2012 was 287 compared with 329 for 2011 and 309 for 2010 fiscal years 2012 2011 and 2010 included net tax credits of 54 million 24 million and 125 million respectively excluding these items teledynes effective tax rates for 2012 2011 and 2010 would have been 310 340 and 381 respectively while there have been congressional discussion about lowering the corporate tax rate in the us to improve global competitiveness a number of factors may impact our effective tax rates which could reduce our net income including 

 

our financial statements are based on estimates required by gaap and actual results may differ materially from those estimated under different assumptions or conditions 

our financial statements are prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states these principles require our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period for example estimates are used when accounting for items such as asset valuations allowances for doubtful accounts allowance for excess and obsolete inventory depreciation and amortization impairment assessments employee benefits taxes recall and warranty costs aircraft product and general liability and contingencies while we base our estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances at the time made actual results may differ materially from those estimated 

while we believe our internal control systems are effective there are inherent limitations in all control systems and misstatements resulting from error or fraud may occur and may not be detected 

we continue to take action to assure compliance with the internal controls disclosure controls and other requirements of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer cannot guarantee that our internal controls and disclosure controls will prevent all possible errors or all fraud a control system no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met in addition the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefit of controls must be relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no system of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within the company have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake further controls can be circumvented by individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more persons or by management override of the controls the design of any system of controls is also based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions over time a control may be inadequate because of changes in conditions or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate because of inherent limitations in a costeffective control system misstatements resulting from error or fraud may occur and may not be detected 

provisions of our governing documents applicable law and our change in control severance agreements could make an acquisition of teledyne more difficult 

our restated certificate of incorporation our amended and restated bylaws and the general corporation law of the state of delaware contain several provisions that could make the acquisition of control of teledyne in a transaction not approved by our board of directors more difficult we have also entered into change in control severance agreements with 17 members of our management which could have an antitakeover effect these provisions may prevent or discourage attempts to acquire our company 

the market price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly since we became a public company and could continue to do so 

since we became an independent public company on november 29 1999 the market price of our common stock has fluctuated substantially and fluctuations in our stock price could continue among the factors that could affect our stock price are 

 the stock markets in general and the markets for high technology companies in particular have experienced a high degree of volatility that is not necessarily related to the operating performance of these companies we cannot provide assurances as to our stock price

teledyne technologies incorporated provides enabling technologies for industrial growth markets we have evolved from a company that was primarily focused on aerospace and defense to one that serves multiple markets that require advanced technology and high reliability these markets include deepwater oil and gas exploration and production oceanographic research air and water quality environmental monitoring factory automation and medical imaging our products include monitoring instrumentation for marine and environmental applications harsh environment interconnects electronic test and measurement equipment digital imaging sensors and cameras aircraft information management systems and defense electronic and satellite communication subsystems we also supply engineered systems for defense space environmental and energy applications we differentiate ourselves from many of our direct competitors by having a customer and company sponsored applied research center that augments our product development expertise 

strategyoverview 

our strategy continues to emphasize growth in our core markets of instrumentation digital imaging aerospace and defense electronics and engineered systems our core markets are characterized by high barriers to entry and include specialized products and services not likely to be commoditized we intend to strengthen and expand our core businesses with targeted acquisitions and through product development we aggressively pursue operational excellence to continually improve our margins and earnings at teledyne operational excellence includes the rapid integration of the businesses we acquire using complementary technology across our businesses and internal research and development we seek to create new products to grow our company and expand our addressable markets we continue to evaluate our businesses to ensure that they are aligned with our strategy 

consistent with this strategy we made five acquisitions in 2012 and three acquisitions in 2011 as well as one significant divestiture in 2011 our largest acquisition in 2012 lecroy corporation “lecroy” broadened our portfolio of analytical instrumentation with the addition of electronic test and measurement solutions we acquired varisystems inc “varisystems” to expand our portfolio of rugged interconnect solutions we acquired blueview technologies inc “blueview” principally to increase our instrumentation content on auvs and rovs used in oil and gas and marine survey applications through the acquisition of a majority interest in the parent company of optech incorporated “optech” we added 3d imaging capability to our portfolio of visible xray and ultraviolet sensors cameras optechs bathymetric lidar systems used for coastal mapping and shallow water profiling also complement our marine survey sensors and systems the acquisition of the parent company of pdm neptec limited “pdm neptec” expanded our line of harsh environmental marine connectors in 2011 we focused on the expansion of our digital imaging capabilities first with the acquisition of dalsa corporation “dalsa” followed by the acquisitions of a majority interest in nova sensors inc nova sensors and a minority interest investment in optech in 

april 2011 we completed the sale of our general aviation piston engine businesses and consequently classified our aerospace engines and components segment as a discontinued operation 

given the strength of our commercial businesses as well as our strategic acquisitions we were able to achieve record sales and earnings in 2012 in 2012 sales and net income from continuing operations increased by 95 and 139 respectively over 2011 results earnings per share from continuing operations in 2012 increased 136 over 2011 in 2012 sales totaled 21273 million compared with sales of 19419 million in 2011 net income for 2012 excluding our discontinued operations was 1618 million or 433 per diluted share compared with 1421 million or 381 per diluted share in 2011 the increase in revenue included incremental sales from acquisitions of 1807 million our 2012 net income including discontinued operations totaled 1641 million or 439 per diluted share compared to 2552 million or 684 per diluted share in 2011 in addition each business segment experienced higher operating profit growth except for the aerospace and defense electronics segment the operating profit decrease for the aerospace and defense electronics segment primarily reflected the impact of lower sales as well as 17 million of severance and relocation costs within certain electronic manufacturing service products businesses 

with the recent acquisition of lecroy in 2012 and dalsa in 2011 as well as growth in our commercial markets our business mix has continued to change and for 2012 teledynes sales were approximately 68 to commercial customers and 32 to the us government this has changed from about 56 commercial and 44 government in 2010 our international sales also increased to 39 of total sales in 2012 compared to 29 in 2010 we have worked to transform our product portfolio into that of a high technology industrial company that is less dependent on us government business

results of operations 

2012 compared with 2011 

  



  

we reported 2012 sales of 21273 million  compared with sales of 19419 million  for 2011 an increase of 95  net income from continuing operations was 1618 million 433 per diluted share for 2012 compared with net income from continuing operations of 1421 million 381 per diluted share for 2011   an increase of 139 net income for 2012 and 2011 also included net tax credits of 54 million and 24 million respectively net income attributable to teledyne including discontinued operations was 1641 million   439  per diluted share for 2012 compared with 2552 million   684  per diluted share for 2011 on april 19 2011 teledyne completed the sale of its piston engines businesses and recorded a gain on the sale of 1138 million 

the increase in sales in 2012 compared with 2011 reflected substantially higher sales in both the instrumentation and digital imaging segments partially offset by slightly lower sales in both the engineered systems and aerospace and defense electronics segments sales in the instrumentation segment reflected 808 million from the acquisition of lecroy as well as higher sales of both marine and environmental instrumentation products sales of marine products increased by 456 million or 122 and included incremental sales of 80 million from the acquisitions of pdm and blueview the increase in the digital imaging segment reflected 669 million in incremental revenue from recent acquisitions primarily optech nova sensors and dalsa sales in the aerospace and defense electronics segment reflected lower sales for electronic manufacturing service products partially offset by higher sales of 124 million from avionics products and electronic relays as well as greater sales of 153 million from microwave devices and interconnects microwave devices and interconnects sales in 2012 included 250 million in revenue from the february 2012 acquisition of varisystems the decrease in the engineered systems segment revenue reflected lower sales of space and defense programs as well as nuclear programs partially offset by higher sales of energy systems and turbine engines 

the incremental increase in revenue in 2012 from businesses acquired in 2012 and in 2011 was 1807 million 

the increase in segment operating profit and other segment income for 2012 compared with 2011 reflected improved results in each operating segment except for the aerospace and defense electronics segment the increase in operating profit primarily reflected the impact of acquisitions the increase in operating profit also reflected the impact of higher sales for the instrumentation segment the decrease in operating profit in the aerospace and defense electronics segment reflected the impact of lower sales reduced margins as well as 17 million of severance and relocation costs within certain electronic manufacturing service products businesses operating profit included incremental operating profit from acquisitions of 94 million which included acquisition expenses of 71 million and intangible amortization of 53 million lifo income was less than 01 million in 2012 compared with lifo expense of 09 million in 2011 

the table below presents sales and cost of sales by segment and total company 



consolidated cost of sales in total dollars increased by 884 million in 2012 compared with 2011 and primarily reflected 942 million in cost of sales from recent acquisitions and organic sales increases partially offset by sales mix differences cost of sales from recent acquisitions totaled 377 million for the instrumentation segment 399 million for the digital imaging segment and 166 million for the aerospace and defense electronics segment the instrumentation segment cost of sales increase reflected the impact of higher organic sales the aerospace and defense electronics segment reflected the impact of lower organic sales cost of sales as a percentage of sales for 2012 was 648 compared with 665 for 2011 the lower cost of sales percentage reflected the impact of the lecroy and dalsa cost structure which has a lower cost of sales percentage than the overall teledyne cost of sales percentage excluding the impact of recent acquisitions cost of sales as a percentage of sales for 2012 would have been 667 

selling general and administrative expenses including research and development and bid and proposal expense in total dollars were higher in 2012 compared with 2011 the increase reflected the impact of higher sales higher acquired intangible asset amortization of 37 million and higher research and development costs of 288 million corporate administrative expense in 2012 was higher by 30 million compared with 2011 and reflected higher employee compensation and professional fee expenses for 2012 we recorded a total of 80 million in stock option expense of which 24 million was recorded as corporate expense and 56 million was recorded in segment results for 2011 we recorded a total of 58 million in stock option expense of which 21 million was recorded as corporate expense and 37 million was recorded in segment results selling general and administrative expenses for 2012 as a percentage of sales increased to 237 compared with 218 for 2011 and reflected the impact of acquisition related expenses higher research and development costs and the lecroy and dalsa cost structures which have a higher selling general and 

administrative expense percentage than the overall teledyne selling general and administrative expense percentage 

included in operating profit in 2012 was domestic pension expense of 66 million in accordance with us government cost accounting standards “cas” 127 million was recoverable from certain government contracts included in operating profit in 2011 was domestic pension expense of 67 million in accordance with cas 126 million was recoverable from certain government contracts pension expense determined under cas can generally be recovered through the pricing of products and services sold to the us government 

the companys effective tax rate for 2012 was 287 compared with 329 for 2011 the decrease reflected a remeasurement of uncertain tax positions in 2012 as well as a change in the proportion of domestic and international income fiscal year 2012 included tax benefits of 54 million primarily related to the remeasurement of uncertain tax positions and an expiration of the statute of limitations in the united states fiscal year 2011 included tax benefits of 24 million related to research and development tax credits excluding the impact of the 54 million for 2012 and 24 million for 2011 the effective tax rates would have been 310 for 2012 compared with 340 for 2011 

  during the next twelve months it is reasonably possible that tax audit resolutions and expirations of the statutes of limitations could reduce unrecognized tax benefits by 137 million either because our tax positions are sustained on audit because the company agrees to their disallowance or because of the expiration of the statutes of limitations of the 137 million 04 million would not impact tax expense as it would be offset by the reversal of deferred tax assets 

sales under contracts with the us government were approximately 32  of sales in 2012 and 36 of sales in 2011 sales to international customers represented approximately 39  of sales in 2012 and 36 of sales in 2011 

total interest expense including credit facility fees and other bank charges was 182 million in 2012 and 167 million in 2011 interest income was 04 million in 2012 and 05 million in 2011 the increase in interest expense primarily reflected the impact of higher outstanding debt levels partially offset by lower overall average interest rates 

other income and expense in 2012 included foreign currency translation gains of 08 million compared with 20 million for 2011 and a 06 million gain on the purchase of the majority interest in optech other income and expense in 2011 also included 23 million related to the reduction of an environmental reserve determined to be no longer needed and a 45 million pretax charge to write off a minority investment in a private company

sales for 2012 decreased by 102 million which resulted from lower sales of 379 million for electronic manufacturing service products partially offset by 124 million of higher sales from avionics products and electronic relays and 153 million from microwave devices and interconnects microwave devices and interconnects sales in 2012 included 250 million from the 2012 acquisition of varisystems operating profit in 2012 decreased due to the decrease in sales 11 million in amortization of acquisition related intangible assets and 04 million in other acquisition expenses related to the varisystems acquisition operating profit in 2012 also reflected reduced margins as well as 17 million of severance and relocation costs within certain electronic manufacturing service products businesses the incremental operating profit for 2012 from recent acquisitions was 18 million cost of sales for 2012 in total dollars decreased by 154 million compared with 2011 and reflected the impact of lower sales and product mix differences cost of sales as a percentage of sales for 2012 decreased to 670 from 683 in 2011 and reflected increased sales of higher gross margin avionics products decreased sales of lower gross margin electronic manufacturing service products as well as the impact of higher gross margin products from varisystems operating profit included pension expense of 27 million for 2012 compared with 39 million for 2011 pension expense allocated to contracts pursuant to cas was 43 million for 2012 compared with 39 million for 2011 in the first half of 2013 we expect additional severance and relocation costs of approximately 40 million associated with certain electronic manufacturing services businesses 

2011 compared with 2010 

our aerospace and defense electronics segment sales were 6708 million in 2011 compared with sales of 6147 million in 2010 an increase of 91 operating profit was 939 million in 2011 compared with 578 million in 2010 an increase of 625 

the 2011 sales increase resulted from 461 million of higher sales of microwave devices and interconnects as well as increased sales of 241 million from avionics products and electronic relays partially offset by a reduction of 141 million in sales of electronic manufacturing services products the increased sales of microwave devices and interconnects included sales of 257 million from acquisitions as well as higher organic sales the increase in operating profit reflected the impact of higher sales and product mix differences and the absence of the 82 million inventory writedown the incremental operating profit from recent acquisitions was 59 million segment operating profit in 2011 also reflected lifo expense of 03 million compared with lifo expense of 04 million in 2010 operating profit included pension expense of 39 million for 2011 compared with 17 million for 2010 pension expense allocated to contracts pursuant to cas was 39 million for 2011 compared with 25 million for 2010 cost of sales in total dollars increased by 61 million in 2011 compared with 2010 and reflected the increase in sales higher pension expense and product mix differences the cost of sales percentage improved due to the sales mix which had higher sales from our more profitable avionics and interconnects products as well the absence of the 82 million inventory writedown in 2010 

engineered systems 



our engineered systems segment provides innovative systems engineering and integration advanced technology development and manufacturing solutions for defense space environmental and energy applications this segment also designs and manufactures electrochemical energy systems and small turbine engines 

2012 compared with 2011 

our engineered systems segment sales were 3014 million in 2012 compared with sales of 3046 million in 2011 a decrease of 11 operating profit was 285 million in 2012 compared with 281 million in 2011 an increase of 14 

the 2012 sales decrease of 32 million reflected lower sales of 49 million from engineered products and services partially offset by higher sales of 09 million for energy systems and 08 million for turbine engines the sales decrease from engineered products and services primarily reflected lower sales of space and defense programs as well as nuclear programs operating profit in 2012 improved slightly despite the small decrease in sales cost of sales in total dollars for 2012 increased by 03 million compared with 2011 and reflected product mix differences cost of sales as a percentage of sales for 2012 increased to 821 compared with 811 in 2011 and reflected product mix differences operating profit included pension expense of 27 million for 2012 compared with 24 million for 2011 pension expense allocated to contracts pursuant to cas was 84 million for 2012 compared with 87 million for 2011

sales for 2011 reflected lower sales of 337 million from engineered products and services and lower energy systems sales of 23 million partially offset by higher sales of 68 million of turbine engines resulting from increased sales for the jassm program the sales decrease from engineered products and services primarily reflected lower sales of space and defense programs partially offset by higher sales of 90 million for environmental systems and 62 million in sales from acquisitions the lower operating profit in 2011 primarily reflected the impact of lower sales partially offset by the impact of higher margins for turbine engines operating profit included pension expense of 24 million for 2011 compared with 16 million for 2010 pension expense allocated to contracts pursuant to cas was 87 million for 2011 compared with 71 million for 2010 cost of sales in total dollars decreased by 255 million in 2011 compared with 2010 and primarily reflected 

the decrease in sales both cost of sales as a percentage of sales and selling general and administrative expense as a percentage of sales were comparable from year to year 

financial condition liquidity and capital resources 

principal capital requirements 

our principal capital requirements are to fund working capital needs capital expenditures voluntary and required pension contributions debt service requirements and acquisitions including the pending acquisition of reson as it is anticipated that operating cash flow together with available borrowings under the credit facility described below will be sufficient to meet these requirements and could be used to fund some acquisitions in 2013 to support acquisitions we may need to raise additional capital our liquidity is not dependent upon the use of offbalance sheet financial arrangements we have no offbalance sheet financing arrangements that incorporate the use of special purpose entities or unconsolidated entities 

revolving credit agreement and senior notes 

on february 25 2011 teledyne refinanced the then existing 5900 million credit facility by terminating the facility and entering into a new facility that has lender commitments totaling 5500 million that has a termination date of february 25 2016 excluding interest and fees no payments are due under the facility until it matures borrowings under our credit facility are at variable rates which are at our option tied to a eurocurrency rate equal to libor london interbank offered rate plus an applicable rate or a base rate as defined in our credit agreement eurocurrency rate loans may be denominated in us dollars or an alternative currency as defined in the agreement eurocurrency or libor based loans under the facility typically have terms of one two three or six months and the interest rate for each such loan is subject to change if the loan is continued or converted following the applicable maturity date base rate loans have interest rates that primarily fluctuate with changes in the prime rate interest rates are also subject to change based on our consolidated   leverage ratio as defined in the credit agreement the credit agreement also provides for facility fees that vary between 020 and 045 of the credit line depending on our consolidated leverage ratio as calculated from time to time 

on october 22 2012 teledyne entered into 2000 million of term loans that mature in october 2015 the proceeds were applied against the 5500 million revolving credit facility on september 15 2010 the company issued 2500 million in aggregate principal amount of private placement senior notes at par the company used the proceeds of the private placement senior notes to pay down amounts outstanding under the companys then existing 5900 million credit facility 

longterm debt consisted of the following in millions   



the company also has 143 million  in capital leases of which 15 million  is current at december 30 2012 teledyne had 136 million  in outstanding letters of credit 

the credit agreements require the company to comply with various financial and operating covenants including maintaining certain consolidated leverage and interest coverage ratios as well as minimum net worth levels and limits on acquired debt at december 30 2012 the company was in compliance with these covenants and we had a significant amount of margin between required financial covenant ratios and our actual ratios currently we do not believe our ability to undertake additional debt financing if needed is reasonably likely to be materially impacted by debt restrictions under our credit agreements subject to our complying with required financial covenants listed in the table below at december 30 2012 the required financial covenant ratios and the actual ratios were as follows 

  



 available borrowing capacity under the 5500 million credit facility which is reduced by borrowings and outstanding letters of credit was 4586 million  at december 30 2012  teledyne also has a 50 million uncommitted credit line which permits credit extensions up to 50 million plus an incremental 20 million solely for standby letters of credit this credit line is utilized as needed for periodic cash needs no amounts are outstanding under this facility at december 30 2012  the maximum amount that could be borrowed under our 5500 million credit facility as of december 30 2012  while still remaining in compliance with our consolidated leverage ratio covenant was 4586 million  the company may amend the 5500 million credit facility in the first quarter of 2013 to extend the termination date and increase the amount of the facility 

permanently reinvested earnings 

we consider the earnings of nonus subsidiaries to be indefinitely invested outside the united states on the basis of estimates that future domestic cash generation will be sufficient to meet future domestic cash requirements at december 30 2012 the amount of undistributed foreign earnings was 875 million we have not recorded a deferred tax liability of approximately 196 million related to the 875 million of undistributed foreign earnings should we decide to repatriate the foreign earnings we would need to adjust our income tax provision in the period we determined that the earnings will no longer be indefinitely invested outside the united states 

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our expected cash outflows resulting from financial contracts and commitments at december 30 2012  we have not included information on our normal recurring purchases of materials for use in our operations these amounts are generally consistent from year to year closely reflect our levels of production and are not longterm in nature in millions 



  

 

unrecognized tax benefits of 426 million are not included in the table above because 97 million is offset by deferred tax assets and the remainder cannot be reasonably estimated to be settled in cash due to a lack of prior settlement history 

at december 30 2012  we are not required to make any cash contributions to the domestic qualified pension plan for 2012 teledyne made a voluntary pretax contribution to its domestic qualified pension plan of 830 million on january 7 2013 teledyne has no required or scheduled contributions to its foreign pension plans for 2013 our minimum funding requirements after 2012 as set forth by erisa are dependent on several factors as discussed under “accounting for pension plans” in the critical accounting policies section of this managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation estimates beyond 2013 have not been provided due to the significant uncertainty of these amounts which are subject to change until the companys pension assumptions can be updated at the appropriate times in addition certain pension contributions are eligible for future recovery through the pricing of products and services to the us government under certain government contracts therefore the amounts noted are not necessarily indicative of the impact these contributions may have on our liquidity we also have payments due under our other postretirement benefit plans these plans are not required to be funded in advance but are pay as you go see further discussion in note 12 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in addition for covered active salaried employees in the domestic pension plan in 2011 the company approved a plan amendment to change the rate at which pension benefits will accrue after february 29 2012 the pension benefit formula was changed from a “final average pay” calculation to a “career average pay” approach this amendment reduced the pension benefit obligation by 433 million in 2011 teledyne intends to continue to monitor and manage its defined pension benefit plans obligation and may take additional actions in the future 

operating activities 

in 2012 net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations was 1895 million compared with 2195 million in 2011 and 1271 million in 2010 the lower cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations in 2012 reflected the impact of the timing of accounts receivable collections and higher cash contributions to the domestic pension plan partially offset by lower income tax payments the 2012 net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations amount includes voluntary cash contributions of 928 million to the domestic pension plan compared with 690 million in voluntary cash contributions to the domestic pension plan for 2011 the higher net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations for 2011 compared with 2010 reflected the impact of higher net income lower income tax payments of 335 million and lower deferred accounts receivable partially offset by higher pretax pension contributions of 242 million 

free cash flow cash from operating activities from continuing operations less capital expenditures was 1242 million in 2012 compared with 1778 million in 2011 and 961 million in 2010 adjusted free cash flow eliminates the impact of pension contributions on a net of tax basis and was 1845 million compared with 2218 million in 2011 and 1242 million in 2010 



  

 

working capital 

working capital increased to 3375 million  at yearend 2012 compared with 2685 million  at yearend 2011 the increase primarily reflected working capital from recent acquisitions as well as higher accounts receivable due to higher sales late in 2012 compared with the same period of 2011 

balance sheet changes 

the changes in the following selected components of teledynes balance sheet are discussed below in millions 

  

the higher balances in accounts receivable inventories goodwill acquired intangible assets accounts payable and other longterm liabilities were impacted by the acquisitions made in 2012 the higher balances in property plant and equipment also reflected the impact of 2012 acquisitions as well as capital spending partially offset by depreciation the higher balance in account receivable also reflected the impact of higher sales late in 2012 compared with the same period of 2011 longterm debt increased and reflected the impact of funds used for acquisitions in 2012 and pension contributions the accumulated other comprehensive loss increase primarily reflects the noncash adjustment of 494 million related to the increase in the unfunded pension liability in 2012 partially offset by 143 million of foreign currency changes the increase in noncontrolling interest primarily reflects the noncontrolling interest related to the optech purchase 

investing activities 

net cash used in investing activities included capital expenditures as presented below in millions 



during 2013 we plan to invest approximately 900 million in capital expenditures principally to upgrade capital equipment reduce manufacturing costs to implement an enterprise resource planning software system and introduce new 

products commitments at december 30 2012  for capital expenditures were approximately 171 million 

investing activities from continuing operations used cash for acquisitions of 3892 million 3667 million and 679 million in fiscal 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively see “recent acquisitions” the 2011 amount includes 189 million for the minority interest in optech and 32 million for the purchase of the remaining minority interest in energy systems 

teledyne funded the acquisitions primarily from borrowings under its credit facility and cash on hand 

in all acquisitions the results of operations and cash flows are included in our consolidated financial statements from the date of each respective acquisition the dalsa nova sensors and optech acquisitions are part of the digital imaging segment the lecroy blueview and pdm acquisitions are part of the instrumentation segment and varisystems is part of the aerospace and defense electronics segment 

the following table shows the purchase price net of cash acquired goodwill acquired and intangible assets acquired for the acquisitions made in fiscal 2012 and 2011 in millions

on october 22 2012 teledyne entered into 2000 million of term loans that mature in october 2015 the proceeds were applied against the 5500 million revolving credit facility 

on february 25 2011 teledyne refinanced the then existing 5900 million credit facility by terminating the facility and entering into a new facility that has lender commitments totaling 5500 million at yearend 2012 we had 4586 million  of available committed credit under the 5500 million credit facility which can be utilized as needed for daily operating and periodic cash needs including acquisitions excluding interest and fees no payments are due under the amended and restated credit facility until it matures in february 2016 as of february 22 2013 we had 1490 million outstanding under the credit facility this reflects cash flow used in operations which includes the impact of the 830 million pension contribution made in january 2013 

on september 15 2010 the company issued 2500 million in aggregate principal amount of private placement senior notes at par the company used the proceeds of the private placement senior notes to pay down amounts outstanding under the companys then existing 5900 million credit facility

other matters 

income taxes 

our income tax expense deferred tax assets and liabilities and reserves for unrecognized tax benefits reflect managements best assessment of estimated current and future taxes to be paid we are subject to income taxes in both the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions significant judgments and estimates are required in determining the consolidated income tax expense 

the companys effective tax rate for 2012 was 287 compared with 329 for 2011 and 309 for 2010 fiscal years 2012 2011 and 2010 included net tax credits of 54 million 24 million and 125 million respectively these relate primarily to research and development tax credits and expiration of statute of limitations on unrecognized tax benefits excluding these items the companys effective tax rates for fiscal years 2012 2011 and 2010 would have been 310 340 and 381 respectively the lower 2012 effective tax rate compared with the 2011 effective tax rate excluding tax credits primarily reflected a change in the proportion of domestic and international income and foreign research and development tax credits based on the companys history of operating earnings expectations of future operating earnings and potential tax planning strategies it is more likely than not that the deferred income tax assets at december 30 2012 will be realized deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amount in the financial statements which will result in taxable or deductible amounts in the future in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets within the jurisdiction from which they arise we consider all available positive and negative evidence including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities projected future taxable income taxplanning strategies and results of recent operations in projecting future taxable income we begin with historical results adjusted for the results of discontinued operations and incorporate assumptions about the amount of future state federal and foreign pretax operating income adjusted for items that do not have tax consequences the assumptions about future taxable income require significant judgment and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses in evaluating the objective evidence that historical results provide we consider three years of cumulative operating income 

changes in tax laws and rates may affect the recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities and our effective tax rate the american taxpayer relief act of 2012 the “act” was signed into law on january 2 2013 because a change in tax law is accounted for in the period of enactment certain provisions of the act benefiting the companys 2012 us federal taxes including the research and development credit and the subpart f controlled foreign corporation look through exception cannot be recognized in the companys 2012 financial results and instead will be reflected in the companys 2013 financial results we estimate that a benefit of approximately 29 million will be accounted for as a discrete item in our tax provision for the first quarter of 2013 in addition we expect the acts extension for these provisions through the end of 2013 will favorably affect our estimated annual effective tax rate for 2013 by approximately 12 percentage points as compared with 2012 

costs and pricing 

inflationary trends in recent years have been moderate current inventory costs the increasing costs of equipment and other costs are considered in establishing sales pricing policies the company emphasizes cost containment in all aspects of its business 

hedging activities market risk disclosures 

teledyne transacts business in various foreign currencies and has international sales and expenses denominated in foreign currencies subjecting the company to foreign currency risk the companys primary objective is to protect the united states dollar value of future cash flows and minimize the volatility of reported earnings due to the february 2011 acquisition of dalsa the company began to utilize foreign currency forward contracts to reduce the volatility of cash flows primarily related to forecasted revenue and expenses denominated in canadian dollars these contracts are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges 

the effectiveness of the cash flow hedge contracts excluding time value is assessed prospectively and retrospectively on a monthly basis using regression analysis as well as using other timing and probability criteria to receive hedge accounting treatment all hedging relationships are formally documented at the inception of the hedges and must be highly effective in offsetting changes to future cash flows on hedged transactions the effective portion of the cash flow hedge contracts gains or losses resulting from changes in the fair value of these hedges is initially reported net of tax as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income aoci in stockholders equity until the underlying hedged item is reflected in our consolidated statements of income at which time the effective amount in accumulated other comprehensive income is reclassified to cost of sales in our consolidated statements of income the company expects to reclassify a gain of approximately 05 million over the next 12 months based on the year end 2012 exchange rate 

in the event that the gains or losses in aoci are deemed to be ineffective the ineffective portion of gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value if any is reclassified to other income and expense in the event that the underlying forecasted transactions do not occur or it becomes remote that they will occur within the defined hedge period the gains or losses on the related cash flow hedges will be reclassified from aoci to other income and expense during the current reporting period all forecasted transactions occurred and therefore there were no such gains or losses reclassified to other income and expense as of december 30 2012  teledyne had foreign currency forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges to buy canadian dollars and to sell us dollars totaling 517 million and these contracts had a fair value of 08 million these foreign currency forward contracts have maturities ranging from march 2013 to february 2014 

in addition the company utilizes foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate foreign exchange rate risk associated with foreigncurrencydenominated monetary assets and liabilities including intercompany receivables and payables and as of december 30 2012 teledyne had foreign currency contracts of this type in the following currency pairs 



these contracts had a fair value of 01 million at december 30 2012 the gains and losses on these derivatives which are not designated as hedging instruments under asc 815 derivatives and hedging “asc 815” are intended to at a minimum partially offset the transaction gains and losses recognized in earnings under asc 815 all derivatives are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value as discussed below the accounting for gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value depends on the use of the derivative and whether it is designated and qualifies for hedge accounting teledyne does not use foreign currency forward contracts for speculative or trading purposes 

notwithstanding our efforts to mitigate portions of our foreign currency exchange rate risks there can be no assurance that our hedging activities will adequately protect us against the risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations a hypothetical 10 percent appreciation of the us dollar from its value at december 30 2012  would decrease the fair value of our foreign currency forward contracts associated with our cash flow hedging activities by 52 million a hypothetical 10 percent depreciation of the us dollar from its value at december 30 2012  would increase the fair value of our foreign currency forward contracts associated with our cash flow hedging activities by 52 million 

borrowings under our credit facility are at fixed rates that vary with the term and timing of each loan under the facility loans under the facility typically have terms of one two three or six months and the interest rate for each such loan is subject to change if the loan is continued or converted following the applicable maturity date interest rates are also subject to change based on our debt to earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization ratio as of december 30 2012  we had 790 million outstanding indebtedness under our 5500 million credit facility any borrowings under the companys revolving credit line are based on a fluctuating market interest rate and consequently the fair value of any outstanding debt should not be affected materially by changes in market interest rates a 100 basis point increase in interest rates would result in an increase in annual interest expense of approximately 08 million assuming the 790 million in debt was outstanding for the full year 

we believe that adequate controls are in place to monitor any hedging activities our primary exposure to market risk relates to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates we periodically evaluate these risks and have taken measures to mitigate these risks we own assets and operate facilities in countries that have been politically stable

environmental 

we are subject to various federal state local and international environmental laws and regulations which require that we investigate and remediate the effects of the release or disposal of materials at sites associated with past and present operations these include sites at which teledyne has been identified as a potentially responsible party under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act commonly known as superfund and comparable state laws we are currently involved in the investigation and remediation of a number of sites reserves for environmental investigation and remediation totaled 32 million at december 30 2012  and 32 million at january 1 2012 as investigation and remediation of these sites proceed and new information is received the company expects that accruals will be adjusted to reflect new information based on current information we do not believe that future environmental costs in excess of those already accrued will materially and adversely affect our financial condition or liquidity however resolution of one or more of these environmental matters or future accrual adjustments in any one reporting period could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations for that period see also our environmental risk factor disclosure beginning at page 21 

for additional discussion of environmental matters see notes 2 and 15 to the notes to consolidated financial statements 

government contracts 

we perform work on a number of contracts with the department of defense and other agencies and departments of the us government including subcontracts with government prime contractors sales under these contracts with the us government which included contracts with the department of defense were approximately 32 of total sales in 2012 36 of total sales in 2011 and 44 of total sales in 2010 for a summary of sales to the us government by segment see note 13 to the notes to consolidated financial statements sales to the department of defense represented approximately 26 29 and 34 of total sales for 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively see also our government contracts risks factor disclosure beginning at page 13 

performance under government contracts has certain inherent risks that could have a material adverse effect on the companys business results of operations and financial condition government contracts are conditioned upon the continuing availability of congressional appropriations which usually occurs on a fiscal year basis even though contract performance may take more than one year

some of the companys products are subject to specified warranties and the company provides for the estimated cost of product warranties we regularly assess the adequacy of our preexisting warranty liabilities and adjust amounts as necessary based on a review of historic warranty experience with respect to the applicable business or products as well as the length and actual terms of the warranties which are typically one year the product warranty reserve is included in current accrued liabilities and other longterm liabilities on the balance sheet changes in the companys product warranty reserve are as follows in millions 



critical accounting policies 

the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with united states generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the notes to the financial statements some of those judgments can be subjective and complex and therefore actual results could differ materially from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions our critical accounting policies are those that are reflective of significant judgment complexity and uncertainty and may potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions we have identified the following as critical accounting policies revenue recognition accounting for pension plans accounting for business combinations goodwill and other longlived assets and accounting for income taxes for additional discussion of the application of these and other accounting policies see note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition 

commercial sales and sales from us government fixedprice type contracts are generally recorded as shipments are made or as services are rendered revenue related to a product or service is recognized when products are shipped to the customer or services have been rendered in accordance with terms of an agreement of sale under which title and risk of loss have been transferred collectability is reasonably assured and pricing is fixed or determinable the companys typical terms of sale are fob shipping point and as such the company primarily records revenue for product sales upon shipment for the very small percentage of sales where title and risk of loss passes at point of delivery the company recognizes revenue upon delivery to the customer assuming all other criteria for revenue recognition are met for contracts that require the company to warehouse certain goods revenue is recognized when all risks of loss is borne by the customer and all other criteria for revenue recognition are met if any significant obligation to the customer with respect to a sales transaction remains to be fulfilled following shipment typically involving acceptance by the buyer revenue recognition is deferred until such obligations have been fulfilled following shipment the company does not offer substantial sales incentives and credits to customers accruals for sales returns and other allowances are provided at the time revenue is recognized based upon past experience 

for certain fixedprice type contracts that require substantial performance over a long time period generally one or more 

years revenues are recorded under the percentageofcompletion method poc we measure the extent of progress toward completion using the unitsofdelivery method costtocost method or upon attainment of scheduled performance milestones which could be time event or expense driven occasionally invoices are submitted to and paid by the customer under a contractual agreement which has a different time schedule than the related revenue recognition sales under costreimbursement contracts usually from the us government are recorded as allowable costs are incurred and fees are earned the percentage of company sales recognized using the poc method has been decreasing and was 367 in 2012 394 in 2011 and 500 in 2010 due to the increase in our commercial business which does not typically utilize the poc method 

the development of cost of sales percentages used to record costs under certain fixedprice type contracts and fees under certain costreimbursement type contracts accounted for under the poc method of accounting requires managements judgment to make reasonably dependable cost estimates for the design manufacture and delivery of products and services generally over a long time period since certain fixedprice and costreimbursement type contracts extend over a long period of time the impact of revisions in cost and revenue estimates during the progress of work may adjust the current period earnings on a cumulative catchup basis this method recognizes in the current period the cumulative effect of the changes on current and prior quarters for fixedprice contracts if the current contract estimate indicates a loss a provision is made for the total anticipated loss in the period that it becomes evident contract cost and revenue estimates for significant contracts are generally reviewed and reassessed quarterly these types of contracts and estimates are most frequently related to our sales to the us government or sales to other defense contractors for ultimate sale to the us government changes in estimates related to contracts accounted for under the poc method are recorded using the cumulative catchup method of accounting the net effect of these favorable and unfavorable changes in estimates were expense of 12 million in 2012 and 03 million of income in both 2011 and 2010 the aggregate effects of these favorable and unfavorable changes in estimates in 2012 2011 and 2010 were 180 million 47 million and 35 million of favorable operating income and 192 million 44 million and 32 million of unfavorable operating income respectively we do not believe that any discrete event or adjustments to an individual contract within the aggregate changes in contract estimates for 2012 2011 or 2010 was material to the consolidated statements of income for such annual periods 

accounting for pension plans 

the companys accounting for its defined benefit pension plan requires that amounts recognized in financial statements be determined on an actuarial basis rather than as contributions are made to the plan a significant element in determining the companys pension income or expense is the expected return on plan assets as well as the assumed discount rate on pension liabilities the company has assumed based upon the types of securities the plan assets are invested in and the longterm historical returns of these investments that the longterm expected return on pension assets will be 825 in 2013 for its domestic pension plan 64 for its united kingdom based pension plan and 30 for its swiss based pension plan which was part of the lecroy acquisition the assumed discount rate will be 44 in 2013 for its domestic pension plan 42 for its united kingdom based pension plan and 18 for its swiss based pension plan the companys longterm expected return on pension assets used in 2012 was 825 for its domestic pension plans and the assumed discount rate used in 2012 was 66 for its united kingdom based pension plan the companys longterm expected return on pension assets used in 2012 was 64 and the assumed discount rate used in 2012 was 47 for its swiss based pension plan the companys longterm expected return on pension assets used in 2012 was 30 and the assumed discount rate used in 2012 was 20 the actual rate of return on pension assets was 139 in 2012 and a negative 04 in 2011 for its domestic pension plans the actual rate of return on pension assets was 70 in 2012 and a negative 27 in 2011 for its united kingdom based pension plan if the actual rate of return on pension assets is above the projection the company may be able to reduce its contributions to the pension trust if the actual rate of return on pension assets is below the projection the company may be required to make additional contributions to the pension trust the company made voluntary pretax cash contributions of 928 million to its domestic pension benefit plan in 2012 and made a voluntary pretax cash contribution of 830 million on january 7 2013 before recovery from the us government the assumed longterm rate of return on assets is applied to the marketrelated value of plan assets at the end of the previous year the marketrelated value of plan assets is a smoothed value where investment gains and losses have been smoothed over five years this produces the expected return on plan assets that is included in the annual pension income or expense calculation for the current year the cumulative difference between this expected return and the actual return on plan assets is deferred and amortized into pension income or expense over future periods at yearend 2012 the company has a 2571 million noncash reduction to stockholders equity and a longterm additional liability of 4186 million related to its pension plans at yearend 2011 the company had a 2082 million noncash reduction to stockholders equity and a longterm additional liability of 3399 million related to its pension plans see note 12 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional pension disclosures 

differences in the discount rate and expected longterm rate of return on assets within the indicated range would have had the following impact on 2012 pension expense in millions 

see note 12 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional pension disclosures 

accounting for business combinations goodwill acquired intangible assets and other longlived assets 

the company accounts for goodwill and purchased intangible assets under asc 80 in all acquisitions the results are included in the companys consolidated financial statements from the date of each respective acquisition business acquisitions are accounted for under the purchase method by assigning the purchase price to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at their fair values and the excess of the purchase price over the amounts assigned is recorded as goodwill purchased intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives adjustments to fair value assessments are recorded to goodwill over the purchase price allocation period 

goodwill and acquired intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized we review goodwill and acquired indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable the company also performs an annual impairment test in the fourth quarter of each year we would test goodwill for impairment between annual tests if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce our enterprise fair value below its book value these events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate including a significant sustained decline in an entitys market value legal factors operating performance indicators competition sale or disposition of a significant portion of the business or other factors based on the annual impairment test completed in the fourth quarter of 2012 no impairment of goodwill or intangible assets with indefinite lives was indicated 

for goodwill impairment testing the company estimates the fair value of the reporting units using a discounted cash flow model based on our best estimate of amounts and timing of future revenues and cash flows and our most recent business and strategic plans and compares the estimated fair value to the carrying value of the reporting unit including goodwill the discounted cash flow model requires judgmental assumptions about projected revenue growth future operating margins discount rates and terminal values there are inherent uncertainties related to these assumptions and managements judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill impairment while the company believes it has made reasonable estimates and assumptions to calculate the fair value of its reporting units it is possible a material change could occur if actual results are not consistent with managements estimates and assumptions goodwill may be overstated and a charge would need to be taken against net earnings 

as of december 30 2012 the company had 35 reporting units for goodwill impairment testing the carrying value of goodwill included in the companys individual reporting units ranges from 05 million to 2354 million the companys analysis in 2012 indicated that in all instances the fair value of the companys reporting units exceeded their carrying values and consequently did not result in an impairment charge the excess of the estimated fair value over the carrying value expressed as a percentage of carrying value of the respective reporting unit for each of the companys reporting units as of the fourth quarter of 2012 the annual testing date ranged from approximately 38 to 2756 

changes in these projections could affect the estimated fair value of certain of the companys reporting units and could result in a goodwill impairment charge in a future period in order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations used in the goodwill impairment test the company applied a hypothetical 10 decrease to the fair values of each reporting unit and compared those values to the reporting unit carrying values based on this sensitivity analysis the company did not identify any goodwill impairment charges 

the impairment test for indefinitelived intangibles other than goodwill primarily trademarks and trade names consists of a comparison of the fair value of the indefinitelived intangible asset to the carrying value of the asset as of the impairment testing date the company estimates the fair value of its indefinitelived intangibles using a discounted cash flow model based on our best estimate of amounts and timing of future revenues and cash flows and our most recent business and strategic plans and compares the estimated fair value to the carrying value of the asset the estimated fair values significantly exceed the carrying value for each of the companys indefinitelived intangible assets as of the fourth quarter of 2012 the annual testing date 

accounting for income taxes 

income tax expense and deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect managements assessment of actual future taxes to be paid on items reflected in the financial statements significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes uncertainty exists regarding tax positions taken in previously filed tax returns still under examination and positions expected to be taken in the current year and future returns deferred tax assets and liabilities arise due to differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and tax carryforwards although we believe our income tax expense and deferred tax assets and liabilities are reasonable no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome will not be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals to the extent that the final tax outcome is different than the amounts recorded such differences will impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made the provision for income taxes includes the impact of uncertain tax benefits that are considered appropriate as well as the related net interest 

significant judgment is required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets in assessing the need for a valuation allowance we consider all available evidence including past operating results estimates of future taxable income and the feasibility of tax planning strategies in the event that we change our determination as to the amount of deferred tax assets that can be realized we will adjust our valuation allowance with a corresponding impact to the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made 

our effective tax rates differ from the statutory rate primarily due to the tax impact of tax credits including prior year research and development tax credits state taxes tax audit settlements and non us subsidiaries taxed at rates less than 35 the effective tax rate was 287 329 and 309 in 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively 

we record uncertain tax positions on the basis of a twostep process whereby 1 we determine whether it is more likely than not that the tax positions will be sustained on the basis of the technical merits of the position and 2 for those tax positions that meet the morelikelythannot recognition threshold we recognize the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50 percent likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement with the related tax authority 

the following presents a rollforward of our unrecognized tax benefits in millions 



we recognized interest related to unrecognized tax benefits of 27 million  and 17 million  within the provision for income taxes in our statements of operations for fiscal year 2012 and 2011 respectively 

as of december 30 2012 we estimated that 329 million of unrecognized tax benefits if resolved in our favor would positively impact the effective tax rate and therefore be recognized as additional tax benefits in our income statement of the 426 million of unrecognized tax benefits 97 million would be offset by deferred tax assets 

we file income tax returns in the united states federal jurisdiction and in various states and foreign jurisdictions the company has substantially concluded on all us federal income tax matters for all years through 2009 california income tax matters for all years through 2006 and canadian income tax matters for all years through 2003 the company is currently under audit in canada for tax periods 2006 through 2011 and in california for tax years 2007 through 2009 the company does not believe that the resolution of any of the audits will have a material adverse effect on the companys results of operations substantially all other material state local and foreign income tax matters have been concluded for years through 2006 

the company anticipates the total unrecognized tax benefit for various federal and state tax items may be reduced by 137 million due to the expiration of statutes of limitation and settlements with tax authorities for various federal state and canadian tax issues in the next 12 months 

recent accounting pronouncements 

in july 2012 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued new accounting guidance on the testing of indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment the guidance allows entities to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine the likelihood of an impairment for an indefinitelived intangible asset and whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative impairment assessment currently required this guidance is effective for annual and interim impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after september 15 2012 with early adoption permitted the company does not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on teledynes financial position results of operations or cash flows 

in 2011 the fasb issued new disclosure guidance related to the presentation of the statement of comprehensive income the new disclosure guidance requires an entity to present the total of comprehensive income the components of net income and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements teledyne adopted the new presentation requirement effective january 2 2012 teledyne elected the twostatement approach presenting other comprehensive income in a separate statement immediately following the condensed consolidated statements of income 

in 2011 the fasb issued new accounting guidance that amends some fair value measurement principles and disclosure requirements the new guidance provides a consistent definition and measurement of fair value as well as similar disclosure requirements between us gaap and international financial reporting standards it also changes certain fair value measurement principles clarifies the application of existing fair value measurement and expands the disclosure requirements particularly for level 3 fair value measurements teledynes adoption of these new provisions effective january 2 2012 did not have an impact on our financial position or results of operations 

safe harbor cautionary statement regarding forwardlooking information 

this managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation contains forwardlooking statements as defined in the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 directly and indirectly relating to earnings growth opportunities product sales capital expenditures pension matters stock option compensation expense the credit facility interest expense severance and relocation costs taxes and strategic plans all statements made in this managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation that are not historical in nature should be considered forwardlooking actual results could differ materially from these forwardlooking statements many factors could change the anticipated results including disruptions in the global economy changes in demand for products sold to the defense electronics instrumentation digital imaging energy exploration and production commercial aviation semiconductor and communications markets funding continuation and award of government programs and cuts to defense spending resulting from future deficit reduction measures including potential automatic cuts to defense spending that have been triggered by the budget control act of 2011 increasing fuel costs could negatively affect the markets of our commercial aviation businesses lower oil and natural gas prices as well as instability in the middle east or other oil producing regions and new regulations or restrictions relating to energy production including with respect to hydraulic fracturing could negatively affect our businesses that supply the oil and gas industry in addition financial market fluctuations affect the value of our pension assets 

changes in the policies of us and foreign governments could result over time in reductions and realignment in defense or other government spending and further changes in programs in which the company participates 

while teledynes growth strategy includes possible acquisitions we cannot provide any assurance as to when if or on what terms any acquisitions will be made acquisitions involve various inherent risks such as among others our ability to integrate acquired businesses retain customers and achieve identified financial and operating synergies there are additional risks associated with acquiring owning and operating businesses outside of the united states including those arising from us and foreign government policy changes or actions and exchange rate fluctuations 

while we believe our control systems are effective there are inherent limitations in all control systems and misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and may not be detected 

additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in the forwardlooking statements is contained beginning on page 12 of this form 10k under the caption “risk factors cautionary statement as to forwardlooking statements” forwardlooking statements are generally accompanied by words such as “estimate” “project” “predict” “believes” or “expect” that convey the uncertainty of future events or outcomes we assume no obligation to publicly update or revise any forwardlooking statements whether as a result of new information or otherwise

we are active in us space programs having held various roles in the space shuttle program and continuing to play a vital role in the science operations area of the international space station “iss” program we provide 24hourperday payload operations in the iss payload operations and integration center located at nasa’s marshall space flight center we also work on the iss cargo mission contract at the johnson space center as a subcontractor to lockheed martin we are the prime contractor on the marshall space flight center systems development and operations support contract which provides engineering services and hardware development support for a variety of space activities we also have a prime blanket purchase agreement with the marshall space flight center for specialized engineering and program support 

we support the us government’s efforts to clean up dangerous materials and waste we apply sophisticated computer aided engineering design modeling and manufacturing skills to support the us army’s edgewood chemical and biological center we also support the us government in the development of engineered systems design build test and install including the whole system live agent test “wslat” chamber the test chamber will be used at the baker lab in dugway utah to exercise biological warfare agent detectors 

we operate a full service radiological analysis laboratory in knoxville tennessee this laboratory has received certification from the national environmental laboratory accreditation program in five states including utah and texas where the largest commercial radiological waste disposal site resides with its nuclear utilities procurement issues committee certification the laboratory also serves almost 50 of the nuclear power plants in united states we also manage and operate a separation purification and analysis of atmospheric samples laboratory for the us government additionally we provide engineering and manufacturing for customers in the commercial nuclear market our contract with usec inc to manufacture gas centrifuge service modules for the american centrifuge project to support fuel production for commercial nuclear power plants has been suspended since 2009 

  

we manufacture products that are primarily highly engineered and high quality machined and metal fabricated components and assemblies for external customers across the spectrum of our core business base including nasa us department of defense customers and the us department of energy as well as commercial customers through our ukbased operations we manufacture precision machined large components and also manufacture advanced composites for the commercial aviation industry 

energy systems 

we manufacture hydrogenoxygen gas generators used worldwide in electrical power generation plants semiconductor manufacturing optical fiber production chemical processing specialty metals float glass and other industrial processes our sales of hydrogen generators have been primarily in developing countries and domestic applications where delivered merchant gas is not practical we also provide thermoelectric and electrochemical energy technology solutions for use in us government programs 

turbine engines 

we design develop and manufacture small turbine engines primarily used in tactical missiles for military markets our engines power the boeing harpoon and standoff land attack missile systems and we are the sole source provider of engines for the baseline lockheed martin joint airtosurface standoff missile “jassm” we also continue to work on advanced technology for small turbine engines and components for programs sponsored by the us air force research laboratory 

customers 

we have hundreds of customers in the various industries we serve no commercial customer accounted for more than 10 of our total sales during 2011 2010 or 2009 

sales to international customers accounted for approximately 36 of total sales in 2011 compared with 29 in 2010 and 26 in 2009 in 2011 we sold products to customers in over 100 foreign countries approximately 90 percent of our sales to foreign customers were made to customers in 24 foreign countries the 2011 top five countries for international sales were the united kingdom norway china germany and south korea and constituted approximately 17 of our total sales 

approximately 36 44 and 47 of our total sales for 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively were derived from contracts with agencies of and prime contractors to the us government information on the company’s sales to the us government including direct sales as a prime contractor and indirect sales as a subcontractor is as follows in millions 

 

 our principal us government customer is the us department of defense these sales represented 29 34 and 36 of our total sales for 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively in 2011 our largest program with the us government was the systems development and operations support contract with nasa’s marshall space flight center which represented 18 of total sales in both 2010 and 2009 our largest program with the us government was the systems engineering and technical assistance contract with the space and missile defense command and it represented 34 and 41 of then total sales respectively 

as described on pages 14 through 16 there are risks associated with doing business with the us government in 2011 approximately 60 of our us government prime contracts and subcontracts were fixedprice type contracts compared to 54 in 2010 and 50 in 2009 under these types of contracts we bear the inherent risk that actual performance cost may exceed the fixed contract price such contracts are typically not subject to renegotiation of profits if we fail to anticipate technical problems estimate costs accurately or control costs during performance additionally us government contracts are subject to termination by the 

  

us government at its convenience without identification of any default when contracts are terminated for convenience we typically recover costs incurred or committed settlement expenses and profit on work completed prior to termination we had seven us government contracts terminated for convenience in 2011 compared to two in 2010 and seven in 2009 

our total backlog of confirmed orders was approximately 9446 million at january 1 2012 compared with 8638 million at january 2 2011 and 8125 million at january 3 2010 we expect to fulfill 98 of such backlog of confirmed orders during 2012 

raw materials and suppliers 

generally our businesses have experienced minimal fluctuations in the supply of raw materials but not without some price volatility while some of our businesses provide services for those businesses that sell hardware and product a portion of the value that we provide is labor oriented such as design engineering assembly and test activities in manufacturing our products we use our own production capabilities and also third party suppliers and subcontractors including international sources some of the items we purchase for the manufacture of our products including certain gyro components for some marine navigation applications certain magnets and helix wire for our traveling wave tubes and certain infrared detectors substrates are purchased from limited or single sources including international sources due to technical capability price and other factors while over the years we have not experienced much difficulty in procuring raw materials components subassemblies and other supplies required in our manufacturing processes continuing disruption in the global economy and financial markets could trigger increased pricing and otherwise affect our suppliers as well as our ability to procure some supplies 

sales and marketing 

our sales and marketing approach varies by segment and by products within our segments a shared fundamental tenet is the commitment to work closely with our customers to understand their needs with an aim to secure preferred supplier and longerterm relationships 

our segments use a combination of internal sales forces distributors and commissioned sales representatives to market and sell our products and services our teledyne instruments companies and other businesses have been working over the years to consolidate or share internal sales and servicing efforts several teledyne businesses have been marketing and selling products collaboratively to similar customers to promote “onestop” shopping under singular “brand” names including teledyne oil  gas teledyne marine teledyne nuclear teledyne water quality and most recently by teledyne microwave solutions 

products are also advertised in appropriate trade journals and by means of various websites to promote our products and other capabilities our personnel regularly participate in relevant trade shows and professional associations 

many of our government contracts are awarded after a competitive bidding process in which we seek to emphasize our ability to provide superior products and technical solutions in addition to competitive pricing 

through teledyne technologies international corp and other subsidiaries the company has established offices in foreign countries to facilitate international sales for various businesses locations include brazil china france germany japan malaysia singapore and the united arab emirates 

competition 

we believe that technological capabilities and innovation and the ability to invest in the development of new and enhanced products are critical to obtaining and maintaining leadership in our markets and the industries in which we compete although we have certain advantages that we believe help us compete effectively in our markets each of our markets is highly competitive our businesses vigorously compete on the basis of quality product performance and reliability technical expertise price and service many of our competitors have and potential competitors could have greater name recognition a larger installed base of products more extensive engineering manufacturing marketing and distribution capabilities and greater financial technological and personnel resources than we do 

  

research and development 

our research and development efforts primarily involve engineering and design related to improving products and developing new products and technologies in the same or similar fields we spent a total of 3157 million in 2011 3199 million in 2010 and 3748 million in 2009 on research and development and bid and proposal costs customerfunded research and development most of which was attributable to work under contracts with the us government represented approximately 68 of total research and development costs for 2011 compared with 81 in 2010 and 84 in 2009 

in 2011 we incurred 1019 million in companyfunded research and development and bid and proposal costs we expect the level of companyfunded research and development and bid and proposal costs to be approximately 1101 million in 2012 

intellectual property 

while we own and control various intellectual property rights including patents trade secrets confidential information trademarks trade names and copyrights which in the aggregate are of material importance to our business we believe that our business as a whole is not materially dependent upon any one intellectual property or related group of such properties we own several hundred active patents and are licensed to use certain patents technology and other intellectual property rights owned and controlled by others similarly other companies are licensed to use certain patents technology and other intellectual property rights owned and controlled by us 

patents patent applications and license agreements will expire or terminate over time by operation of law in accordance with their terms or otherwise we do not expect the expiration or termination of these patents patent applications and license agreements to have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

employees 

we consider our relations with our employees to be good our total current workforce consists of approximately 8890 employees of which approximately 6810 employees are located in the united states approximately 1020 employees were added with the dalsa acquisition 

executive management 

teledyne’s executive management includes 

 

   

 

   

  

 dr mehrabian and teledyne have entered into a fourth amended and restated employment agreement dated as of january 21 2009 under the agreement we will employ dr mehrabian as the chairman president and chief executive officer through at least december 31 2013 because 12 months notice of nonrenewal had not been given prior to the expiration of the term ended december 31 2011 the agreement automatically renews for a successive one year unless either party gives the other written notice of its election not to renew at least 12 months before the expiration of the current term or any successive renewal terms if notice is given dr mehrabian would then retire on december 31st of the year following the 12th month after receipt of the notice under the agreement dr mehrabian’s annual base salary is 885000 the agreement provides that dr mehrabian is entitled to participate in teledyne’s annual incentive bonus plan “aip” and other executive compensation and benefit programs the agreement provides dr mehrabian with a nonqualified pension arrangement under which teledyne will pay him annually starting six months following his retirement and for a period of 10 years as payments supplemental to any accrued pension under our qualified pension plan an amount equal to 50 of his base compensation as in effect at retirement 

eighteen current members of management have entered into change of control severance agreements the agreements have a threeyear automatically renewing term except as noted below the executive is entitled to severance benefits if 1 there is a change in control of the company and 2 within three months before or 24 months after the change in control either we terminate the executive’s employment for reasons other than cause or the executive terminates the employment for good reason “severance benefits” currently consist of 

 

  

   

  

  

  

  

  

  

 the agreements were amended as of december 31 2008 to defer certain payments for six months following a separation of service to assure compliance with section 409a of the internal revenue code 

on or before february 25 2011 dr mehrabian mr pichelli mr geveden and eight other executives voluntarily agreed to amend and restate their agreements to conform the agreements to prevailing best practices subsequently the company entered into change of control severance agreements which substantially conformed to the amended and restated agreement version with two other executives as compared to the prior agreements as reflected above the amended and restated change in control severance agreements contain four key changes or reductions as follows 

 

  

  

  

 on january 31 2011 teledyne also provided notice to mr kuelbs and mr schnittjer and three other executives who did not agree to sign the amended and restated change in control agreement that it would not extend the term of their agreements which action results in the termination of their existing change in control severance agreement three years from the date of such notice january 31 2014 

  

effective april 22 2009 the company entered into individual indemnification agreements with directors and certain officers and executives of teledyne including those then members of executive management listed above a total of 25 persons have such agreements simply the indemnification agreements provide the directors and executives who are parties to the agreements with a standalone contractual right to indemnification and expense advancement to the greatest extent allowable under delaware law some further details include 

 

  

  

 our indemnification obligations do not cover the following situations 1 where indemnification payments have been made under director’s  officer’s insurance or other indemnification provisions 2 where the claim is based on disgorgement of shortswing profits under section 16b of the exchange act 3 where the claim is based on reimbursement by the indemnitee to the company of a bonus or other incentivebased or equitybased compensation if required under the exchange act eg in connection with a restatement as a result of the company’s noncompliance with the financial reporting requirements required by section 304 of the sarbanesoxley act or 4 where the proceeding is initiated by the indemnitee other than proceedings that are consented to by the board or that the indemnitee initiates against the company to enforce the agreement 

under the indemnification agreements in the event of a change in control or we reduce or do not renew our director’s  officer’s insurance coverage we are required to purchase or cause the acquirer or successor to the company to purchase or maintain a sixyear tail policy subject to a 200 premium cap the agreements continue until the later of i 10 years after the indemnitee ceases to serve as a director or officer and ii one year following the final termination of any proceeding subject to the agreement 

 

tablestart 


 item 1 a risk factors tableend risk factors cautionary statement as to forwardlooking statements 

the following text highlights various risks and uncertainties associated with teledyne these factors could materially affect “forwardlooking statements” within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 that we may from time to time make including forwardlooking statements contained in “item 1 business” and “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” of this form 10k and in teledyne’s 2011 annual report to stockholders it is not possible for management to predict all such factors and new factors may emerge additionally management cannot assess the impact of each such factor on teledyne or the extent to which any factor or combination of factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forwardlooking statements 

  

  

a new global recession continued economic uncertainty in europe or an economic downturn in china may adversely affect us 

if another global recession emerges if economic uncertainty in europe continues or worsens or if economic growth in china substantially slows we may experience declines in revenues profitability and cash flows from reduced orders payment delays collection difficulties or other factors caused by the economic problems of customers if the negative conditions in the global credit markets prevent our customers’ access to credit or render them insolvent orders for our products may decrease which would result in lower revenue likewise if our suppliers face challenges in obtaining credit in selling their products or otherwise in operating their businesses or remaining solvent they may become unable to offer the materials we use to manufacture our products these events could adversely impact our ability to manufacture affected products and could also result in reductions in our revenue increased price competition and increased operating costs which could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

with the acquisition of dalsa corporation the risk profile of teledyne may differ materially from prior years which could materially change teledyne’s results of operations 

on february 12 2011 teledyne completed its largest acquisition to date when it acquired dalsa corporation for an aggregate cash purchase price of 3395 million dalsa headquartered in waterloo ontario canada with key operations in canada as well as the netherlands and japan designs develops manufactures and markets digital imaging products and semiconductors as discussed on pages 17 to 18 while there are risks associated with acquisitions generally including integration risks there are additional risks associated with owning and operating businesses internationally including those arising from us and foreign policy changes and exchange rate fluctuations with this acquisition a greater percentage of teledyne’s revenues and expenses will arise from international sources in addition like other teledyne businesses continued innovation and research and development efforts will be required to maintain teledyne dalsa’s leadership position in digital imaging products and semiconductor production teledyne dalsa’s business also may be more capital intensive than other teledyne businesses increasing teledyne’s capital requirements further teledyne dalsa currently relies on a number of singlepoint of failure pieces of manufacturing equipment or processes within its semiconductor business a catastrophic failure of such equipment or processes could have a material adverse impact on its business additionally with this acquisition a larger percentage of teledyne’s sales are to commercial customers as opposed to the us government 

we sell products and services to customers in industries that are cyclical and sensitive to changes in general economic activity 

we develop and manufacture products for customers in the energy exploration and production markets domestic and international commercial aerospace markets the semiconductor industry consumer electronics and the automotive industry each of which has been cyclical and suffered from fluctuating market demands a cyclical downturn in these markets may materially affect future operating results 

in addition we sell products and services to customers in industries that are sensitive to the level of general economic activity and consumer spending habits and in more mature industries that are sensitive to capacity adverse economic conditions affecting these industries may reduce demand for our products and services which may reduce our revenues profits or production levels some of our businesses serve industries such as power generation and petrochemical refining which may be negatively impacted by reductions in global capital expenditures and manufacturing capacity 

our dependence on revenue from government contracts subjects us to many risks 

our revenue from government contracts depends on the continued availability of funding from the us government and accordingly we have the risk that funding for our existing contracts may be canceled or diverted to other uses or delayed 

we perform work on a number of contracts with the department of defense and other agencies and departments of the us government including subcontracts with government prime contractors sales under contracts with the us government as a whole including sales under contracts with the department of defense as prime contractor or subcontractor represented approximately 36 of our total revenue in 2011 as compared 

  

with 44 in 2010 and 47 in 2009 performance under government contracts has certain inherent risks that could have a material effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

government contracts are conditioned upon the continuing availability of congressional appropriations and that failure of congress to appropriate funds for programs in which we participate could negatively affect our results of operations the failure by congress to approve budgets on a timely basis could delay procurement of our services and products and cause us to lose future revenues the us government’s inability to complete its budget process or to fund government operations pursuant to a continuing resolution may result in a us government shutdown which could result in a material loss of revenues for us as a result of the failure of the joint select committee on deficit reduction super committee to agree on a deficit reduction plan mandatory reductions in defense are required under the budget control act of 2011 the extent and scope of these mandatory reductions are difficult to assess at this time us defense spending is expected to decline in some areas over the next few years an emphasis on federal deficit and debt reduction and the effects of the budget control act could lead to a decrease in overall defense spending the continued war on terrorism and a winding down of the iraq and afghanistan wars also could result in a diversion of funds from programs in which teledyne participates budgetary concerns could result in future contracts being awarded more on price than on other competitive factors and smaller defense budgets could result in more intense competition on programs which could result in lower revenues and profits 

continued defense spending does not necessarily correlate to continued business for us because not all of the programs in which we participate or have current capabilities may be provided with continued funding changes in policy and budget priorities by the president his administration and our congress for various defense and nasa programs could continue to impact our engineered systems and aerospace and defense electronics segments for example changes in national space policy that affect nasa’s budget have occurred there have also been significant reductions in missile defense budgets we anticipate continuing scrutiny of those budgets to impact our revenues our engineered systems segment may be further impacted by delays in production funding on the joint air to surface standoff missile “jassm” program and a possible reduction of continued production runs under the harpoon missile program the timing of program cycles can also affect our results of operations for a particular quarter or year it is not uncommon for the department of defense to delay the timing of awards for major programs for six to twelve months or more beyond the original projected timeframe reductions and delays in research and development funding by the us government may continue to impact our revenues as the defense advanced research projects agency referred to as darpa reviews its programs aimed to enhance technologically us military capabilities and national security changes to the darpa research and technology development programs in which we participate could occur finally various department of defense initiatives such as the emphasis on insourcing positions to the government and anticipated reductions or cancellations of existing programs could negatively impact our engineered systems segment 

our participation in government programs may decrease or be subject to renegotiation as those programs evolve over time 

the us government has been placing emphasis on small business quotas and increasing small business contract set asides and minimum work percentages in some cases prime contractors are required to reduce participation by large subcontractors like teledyne in order to fill small business quotas and be responsive to proposals and bids as a result our engineered systems segment could be significantly impacted 

over time and for a variety of reasons programs can evolve and affect the extent of our participation for example teledyne brown engineering inc’s groundbased midcourse defense program was negatively impacted by both the nominal end date of development activity and the change in focus of the current administration relative to missile defense 

we have been a significant participant in nasa programs primarily through our engineered systems segment and through teledyne scientific company over the past two years the president introduced significant changes to the national space policy the current administration has cancelled nasa’s constellation program which includes ares launch vehicles the current administration plans to utilize commercial launch vehicles for crew and cargo iss expeditions and develop a nasa heavy lift launch vehicle for space exploration as a result 

  

of these changes we will attempt to transition our business to meet the needs of the new policy and programs however failure to transition our business successfully could result in reduced sales in addition delayed funding and lack of clear focus and support for nasa’s new space policy could negatively impact our business 

our contracts with the us government are subject to termination rights that could adversely affect us 

most of our us government contracts are subject to termination by the us government either at its convenience or upon the default of the contractor termination for convenience provisions provide only for the recovery of costs incurred or committed settlement expenses and profit on work completed prior to termination termination for default clauses impose liability on the contractor for excess costs incurred by the us government in reprocuring undelivered items from another source we had seven us government contracts terminated for convenience in 2011 compared to two in 2010 and seven in 2009 

we may lose money or generate less than expected profits on our fixedprice government contracts and we may lose money if we fail to meet certain prespecified targets in government contracts 

there is no guarantee that us government contracts will be profitable a number of our us government prime contracts and subcontracts are fixedprice type contracts 60 of our total us government contracts were fixedprice in 2011 54 in 2010 and 50 in 2009 under these types of contracts we bear the inherent risk that actual performance cost may exceed the fixed contract price under such contracts we must absorb cost overruns notwithstanding the difficulty of estimating all of the costs we will incur in performing these contracts we cannot assure that our contract loss provisions in our financial statements will be adequate to cover all actual future losses we may lose money on some contracts if we fail to meet these estimates 

our business is subject to government contracting regulations and our failure to comply with such laws and regulations could harm our operating results and prospects 

we like other government contractors are subject to various audits reviews and investigations including private party “whistleblower” lawsuits relating to our compliance with federal and state laws should the business or division involved be charged with wrongdoing or should the us government determine that the business or division is not a “presently responsible contractor” that business or division and conceivably our company as a whole could be temporarily suspended or in the event of a conviction could be debarred for up to three years from receiving new government contracts or governmentapproved subcontracts in addition we could expend substantial amounts defending against such charges and in damages fines and penalties if such charges were proven or were to result in negotiated settlements 

united states and global responses to terrorism the end of the war in iraq and the winding down of war in afghanistan the mass protests and turmoil in middle eastern countries mexican border town violence concerns regarding nuclear proliferation and the safety of nuclear energy potential epidemics financial issues facing airlines and volatile energy prices increase uncertainties with respect to many of our businesses and may adversely affect our business and results of operations 

united states’ and global responses to terrorism the announced end of war in iraq and the winding down of war in afghanistan the mass protests and turmoil in middle eastern countries mexican border town violence and nuclear proliferation concerns increase uncertainties with respect to us and other business and financial markets and could adversely affect our business and operations 

air travel declines have occurred after terrorist attacks and heightened security alerts as well as after the h1n1 virus sars and bird flu scares additional declines in air travel resulting from such factors and other factors could adversely affect the financial condition of many of our commercial airline and aircraft manufacturer customers and in turn could adversely affect our aerospace and defense electronics segment in addition a prolonged virus epidemic or pandemic or the threat thereof could result in worker absences lower productivity voluntary closure of our offices and manufacturing facilities disruptions in our supply chain travel restrictions on our employees and other disruptions to our businesses moreover health epidemics may force local health and government authorities to mandate the temporary closure of our offices and manufacturing facilities 

  

deterioration of financial performance of airlines could result in a reduction of discretionary spending for upgrades of avionics and inflight communications equipment which would adversely affect our aerospace and defense electronics segment 

higher oil prices could adversely affect commercial airlinerelated customers of our aerospace and defense electronics segment conversely lower oil prices could decrease oil exploration and petrochemical refining activities and hinder our marine and other instrumentation businesses in addition instability in the middle east or other oilproducing regions could adversely affect expansion plans of the oil and gas industry customers of our instrumentation and cable solutions businesses 

the fukushima daiichi nuclear incident in 2011 created uncertainty for our us nuclear market customers for new nuclear power plant construction this uncertainty could have an impact on investments in the nuclear market including investments associated with building enriched uranium plants which could have an adverse impact on our engineered systems segment 

acquisitions involve inherent risks that may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

our growth strategy includes acquisitions acquisitions involve various inherent risks such as 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 while we conduct financial and other due diligence in connection with our acquisitions and generally seek some form of protection including indemnification from a seller and sometimes an escrow of a portion of the purchase price to cover potential issues such acquired companies may have weaknesses or liabilities that are not accurately assessed or brought to our attention at the time of the acquisition further indemnities or escrows may not fully cover such matters particularly matters identified after a closing 

under sec rules teledyne must issue a report on management’s assessment of the effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting the sec permits a limited timebased exclusion for acquisitions to give a company an opportunity to evaluate more fully the internal controls of acquired companies and correct deficiencies and institute new or additional internal controls our 2011 management’s report specifically excludes from its scope and coverage our 2011 acquisition of a majority interest in nova sensors allowing us additional time to evaluate existing internal controls and implement additional controls as appropriate with regard to future acquisitions we can provide no assurance that we will be able to provide a report that contains no significant deficiencies or material weaknesses with respect to these acquired companies or other acquisitions 

  

in connection with our acquisitions including ones which we do not complete we may incur significant transaction costs we are required to expense as incurred such transaction costs which may have an adverse impact on our quarterly financial results 

we are subject to the risks associated with international sales which could harm our business or results of operations 

during 2011 sales to international customers accounted for approximately 36 of our total revenues as compared to 29 in 2010 and 26 in 2009 we anticipate that future sales to international customers will continue to account for a significant and increasing percentage of our revenues particularly since business and growth plans for many teledyne businesses focus on sales outside of the united states including to emerging markets such as china and brazil the dalsa acquisition also has contributed to greater international sales risks associated with these sales include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition exchange rate fluctuations may negatively affect the cost of our products to international customers and therefore reduce our competitive position with the acquisition of canadabased dalsa volatility in the value of the canadian dollar relative to the us dollar or other foreign currencies could adversely affect the business operations and the financial condition of our digital imaging segment 

sales of our products and services internationally are subject to us and local government regulations and procurement policies and practices including regulations relating to importexport control violations of export control rules could result in suspension of our ability to export items from one or more businesses or the entire corporation depending on the scope of the suspension this could have a material effect on our ability to perform certain international contracts 

among other things we are subject to the us foreign corrupt practices act or fcpa which generally prohibits us companies and their intermediaries from bribing foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or keeping business or otherwise obtaining favorable treatment in particular while we have procedures in place and conduct fcpa training we may be held liable for actions taken by our strategic or local partners even though our partners are not subject to the fcpa further the united kingdom recently implemented the uk bribery act which raises the bar for antibribery law enforcement and compliance relative to the fcpa any determination that we had violated the fcpa the uk bribery act or equivalent antibribery and corruption laws in countries in which we do business could result in sanctions that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our indebtedness could materially and adversely affect our business 

as of january 1 2012 we had 2980 million in total outstanding indebtedness this indebtedness included 2500 million in senior unsecured notes issued and sold in a private placement transaction in september 2010 and 480 million under our 5500 million credit facility that we entered into in february 2011 which does not terminate until february 25 2016 our indebtedness could harm our business by among other things reducing the funds available to make new strategic acquisitions our indebtedness could also have a material adverse effect on our business by increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions or a 

  

downturn in our business general adverse economic and industry conditions or a downturn in our business could result in our inability to repay this indebtedness in a timely manner we may also elect to raise other forms of debt capital depending on financial market and economic conditions 

product liability claims product recalls and field service actions could have a material adverse effect on our reputation business results of operations and financial condition and we may have difficulty obtaining product liability and other insurance coverage 

as a manufacturer and distributor of a wide variety of products including monitoring instruments products used in offshore oil and gas production products used in commercial aviation and medical devices our results of operations are susceptible to adverse publicity regarding the quality or safety of our products in part product liability claims challenging the safety of our products may result in a decline in sales for a particular product which could adversely affect our results of operations this could be the case even if the claims themselves are proven untrue or settled for immaterial amounts 

while we have general liability and other insurance policies concerning product liabilities we have selfinsured retentions or deductibles under such policies with respect to a portion of these liabilities awarded damages could be more than our accruals we could incur losses above the aggregate annual policy limit as well we cannot assure that for 2012 and in future years insurance carriers will be willing to renew coverage or provide new coverage for product liability 

product recalls can be expensive and tarnish our reputation and have a material adverse effect on the sales of our products 

we have been joined among a number of defendants often over 100 in lawsuits alleging injury or death as a result of exposure to asbestos also because of the prominent “teledyne” name we may continue to be mistakenly joined in lawsuits involving a company or business that was not assumed by us as part of our 1999 spinoff to date we have not incurred material liabilities in connection with these lawsuits however our historic insurance coverage including that of its predecessors may not fully cover such claims and the defense of such matters coverage typically depends on the year of purported exposure and other factors nonetheless we intend to defend these claims vigorously 

certain gas generators historically manufactured by teledyne energy systems inc contained a sealed wetted asbestos component while the company has transitioned to a replacement material had placed warning labels on its products and took care in handling of this discontinued material by employees there is no assurance that the company will not face product liability or workers compensation claims involving this component 

our teledyne brown engineering inc’s laboratory in knoxville tennessee performs radiological analyses errors and omissions in analyses may occur our insurance coverage or indemnities may not be adequate to cover potential problems associated with faulty radiological analyses 

teledyne brown engineering inc and other teledyne companies manufacture components for customers in the nuclear power market including utilities and certain governmental entities certain liabilities associated with such products are covered by the price anderson act and other statutory and common law defenses and we have received indemnities from some of our customers however there is no assurance we will not face product liability claims related to such products or that our exposure will not exceed the amounts for which we have liability coverage or protection 

we cannot assure that we will not have additional product liability claims or that we will not recall any additional products 

our pension expenses and the value of our pension assets are affected by factors outside of our control including the performance of plan assets the stock market interest rates and actuarial data 

we have a defined benefit qualified pension plan covering most of our us employees hired prior to 2004 approximately 27 of our employees the value of the combined pension assets is currently less than our accumulated pension benefit obligation the accounting rules applicable to our qualified pension plan require that amounts recognized in the financial statements be determined on an actuarial basis rather than as 

  

contributions are made to the plan two significant elements in determining our pension income or pension expense are the expected return on plan assets and the discount rate used in projecting pension benefit obligations declines in the stock market and lower rates of return could increase required contributions to our qualified pension plan our investment strategy may not be successful if the credit financial or stock markets deteriorate any decreases or increases in market interest rates will affect the discount rate assumption used in projecting pension benefit obligations if and to the extent decreases are not offset by voluntary contributions or asset returns our required cash contributions and pension expense could increase under the plans for additional discussion of pension matters see the discussion under “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition” and notes 2 and 12 to notes to consolidated financial statements 

our future financial results could be adversely impacted by asset impairment charges 

under current accounting guidance we are required to test annually both acquired goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment based upon a fair value approach rather than amortizing them over time we have chosen to perform our annual impairment reviews of goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year we also are required to test goodwill for impairment between annual tests if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce our enterprise fair value below its book value these events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate including a significant sustained decline in an entity’s market value legal factors operating performance indicators competition sale or disposition of a significant portion of the business or other factors if the fair market value is less than the carrying value including goodwill we could be required to record an impairment charge the valuation of reporting units requires judgment in estimating future cash flows discount rates and estimated product life cycles in making these judgments we evaluate the financial health of the business including such factors as industry performance changes in technology and operating cash flows as we have grown through acquisitions the amount of goodwill and net acquired intangible assets is significant compared with our total assets as a result the amount of any annual or interim impairment could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our reported financial results for the period in which the charge is taken we also may be required to record an earnings charge or incur unanticipated expenses if as a result of a change in strategy or other reason we were to determine the value of other assets had been impaired 

we may not have sufficient resources to fund all future research and development and capital expenditures or possible acquisitions 

in order to remain competitive we must make a substantial investment in research and development of new or enhanced products and continuously upgrade our process technology and manufacturing capabilities in september 2006 we acquired rockwell scientific company llc a provider of research and development services primarily in the areas of electronics optics information sciences and materials technologies and in 2011 we acquired dalsa which historically has made significant investments in research and development relative to total revenues with teledyne scientific company in our portfolio we have been more actively promoting and funding joint research and development projects with other teledyne businesses including teledyne brown engineering inc teledyne reynolds inc and our teledyne oil  gas businesses we may be unable to fund all of our research and development and capital investment needs or possible acquisitions our ability to raise additional capital will depend on a variety of factors some of which will not be within our control including the existence of a public offering market investor perceptions of us our businesses and the industries in which we operate and general economic conditions failure to successfully raise needed capital on a timely or costeffective basis could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

we may be unsuccessful in our efforts to increase our participation in certain new markets 

we intend to both adapt our existing technologies and develop new products to expand into new market segments we may be unsuccessful in accessing these and other new markets if our products do not meet our customers’ requirements as a result of changes in either technology and industry standards or because of actions taken by our competitors 

limitations in customer funding for applied research and development and technology insertion projects and government support for research and development expenditures may reduce our ability to apply our ongoing investments in some market areas 

  

we may be unable to successfully introduce new and enhanced products in a timely and costeffective manner which could harm our growth and prospects 

our operating results depend in part on our ability to introduce new and enhanced products on a timely basis in order to improve our product development capabilities we purchased the research center that is now teledyne scientific company in 2006 and in 2011 we purchased dalsa which has access to a wellequipped mems research and development center successful product development and introduction depend on numerous factors including our ability to anticipate customer and market requirements changes in technology and industry standards our ability to differentiate our offerings from offerings of our competitors and market acceptance we may not be able to develop and introduce new or enhanced products in a timely and costeffective manner or to develop and introduce products that satisfy customer requirements 

our new products also may not achieve market acceptance or correctly address new industry standards and technological changes we may also lose any technological advantage to competitors if we fail to develop new products in a timely manner 

additionally new products may trigger increased warranty costs as such products are tested further by actual usage accelerated entry of new products to meet heightened market demand and competitive pressures may cause additional warranty costs as development and testing time periods might be accelerated or condensed 

technological change and evolving industry and regulatory standards could cause certain of our products or services to become obsolete or noncompetitive 

the markets for some of our products and services are characterized by rapid technological development evolving industry standards changes in customer requirements and new product introductions and enhancements a faster than anticipated change in one or more of the technologies related to our products or services or in market demand for products or services based on a particular technology could result in faster than anticipated obsolescence of certain of our products or services and could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition currently accepted industry and regulatory standards are also subject to change which may contribute to the obsolescence of our products or services 

we may not be able to reduce the costs of our products to satisfy customers’ cost reduction mandates which could harm our sales or margins 

more and more customers continue to seek price reductions of our products while we continually work to reduce our manufacturing and other costs of our products without affecting product quality and reliability there is no assurance that we will be able to do so and do so in a timely manner to satisfy the pricing pressures of our customers cost reductions of raw materials and other components used in our products may be beyond our control depending on market credit and economic conditions customers may seek lower cost products from china and other developing countries where manufacturing costs are lower 

the airline industry is heavily regulated and if we fail to comply with applicable requirements our results of operations could suffer 

governmental agencies throughout the world including the us federal aviation administration or the faa prescribe standards and qualification requirements for aircraft components including virtually all commercial airline and general aviation products specific regulations vary from country to country although compliance with faa requirements generally satisfies regulatory requirements in other countries if any material authorization or approval qualifying us to supply our products is revoked or suspended then the sale of the product would be prohibited by law which would have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

from time to time the faa or equivalent regulatory agencies in other countries propose new regulations or changes to existing regulations which are usually more stringent than existing regulations if these proposed regulations are adopted and enacted we may incur significant additional costs to achieve compliance which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

increasing competition could reduce the demand for our products and services 

each of our markets is highly competitive many of our competitors have and potential competitors could have greater name recognition a larger installed base of products more extensive engineering manufacturing marketing and distribution capabilities and greater financial technological and personnel resources than we do new or existing competitors may also develop new technologies that could adversely affect the demand for our products and services industry acquisition and consolidation trends particularly among aerospace and defense contractors have adversely impacted demand for our aerospace and defense related engineering services as large prime contractors insource increased amounts of major acquisition programs and also require significant expansion in small business participation to meet government contracting goals lowcost competition from china and other developing countries could also result in decreased demand for our products increasing competition could reduce the volume of our sales or the prices we may charge which would negatively impact our revenues smaller defense budgets both in the united states and europe could result in additional competition for new and existing defense programs 

we sell products to customers in industries that may again undergo rapid and unpredictable changes which could adversely affect our operations results or production levels 

we develop and manufacture products for customers in industries that have undergone rapid changes in the past for example we manufacture products that serve the semiconductor and telecommunications markets in 2009 dalsa experienced a significant decline in demand for its products for the semiconductor and electronics inspection industries these industries or others that we serve may exhibit rapid changes in the future and may adversely affect our operating results or our production levels or both 

our engineered systems segment manufactures gas centrifuge service modules for usec inc used in the american centrifuge project in may 2010 usec announced that toshiba and babcock and wilcox signed definitive agreements to provide coinvestments of 100 million each in the american centrifuge plant payable in three installments in late july 2010 usec updated its application to the department of energy which triggered the initial investment of 750 million from toshiba and babcock and wilcox however usec has not secured a loan guarantee from the us department of energy and it has not authorized a return to full production failure to secure the loan guarantees would seriously jeopardize usec’s ability to finance and therefore complete the centrifuge project continuation of this project may depend on usec receiving a favorable ruling regarding its loan guarantee application if usec does not receive a favorable ruling future funding on this program could be reduced or eliminated in such an event our engineered systems segment may experience reduced sales 

our business and financial results could be adversely affected by conditions and other factors associated with our suppliers 

some items we purchase for the manufacture of our products are purchased from limited or single sources of supply due to technical capability price and other factors we have also outsourced from time to time the manufacturing of certain parts components subsystems and even finished products to single or limited sources including international sources disruption of these sources could cause delays or reductions in shipments of our products or increases in our costs which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or operations international sources possess additional risks some of which are similar to those described above in regard to international sales with any continuing disruption in the global economy and financial markets some of our suppliers may also continue to face issues gaining access to sufficient credit and materials to maintain their businesses which could reduce the availability of some components and to the extent such suppliers are single source suppliers could adversely affect our ability to continue to manufacture and sell our products continuing economic pressure on suppliers may also trigger increased pricing or workforce reductions or reduced workweeks possibly creating longer lead times to obtain needed components for our products 

compliance with increasing environmental and climate change regulations as well as the effects of potential environmental liabilities could have a material adverse financial effect on us 

we like other industry participants are subject to various federal state local and international environmental laws and regulations we may be subject to increasingly stringent environmental standards in the future particularly as greenhouse gas emissions and climate change regulations and initiatives increase future developments administrative actions or liabilities relating to environmental and climate change matters could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition additionally environmental regulations imposed on its customers including hydraulic fracturing moratoriums could adversely affect the business of recently acquired varisystems inc 

  

our manufacturing operations could expose us to material environmental liabilities and companies we acquire may have environmental liabilities that are not accurately assessed or brought to our attention at the time of the acquisition 

for additional discussion of environmental matters see the discussion under the caption “other matters — environmental” of “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of results of operation and financial condition” and note 15 to notes to consolidated financial statements 

the us environmental protection agency announced that greenhouse gases ghgs threaten the public health and welfare of the american people epa also maintains that ghg emissions from onroad vehicles contribute to that threat epa’s endangerment finding covers emissions of six greenhouse gases epa’s efforts to limit ghg emissions could adversely affect our us manufacturing operations increase prices for energy fuel and transportation require us to accommodate changes in parameters such as the way parts are manufactured and may in some cases require us to redesign of certain products this could lead to increased costs which we may not be able to recover from customers delays in product shipments and loss of market share to competitors 

our inability to attract and retain key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our future success 

our future success depends to a significant extent upon the continued service of our executive officers and other key management and technical personnel and on our ability to continue to attract retain and motivate qualified personnel we also have a maturing work force while we have engaged in succession planning the loss of the services of one or more of our key employees or our failure to attract retain and motivate qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we may not be able to sell or exit on acceptable terms businesses that we determine no longer meet with our growth strategy 

consistent with our strategy to emphasize growth in our core markets we continually evaluate our businesses to ensure that they are aligned with our strategy most recently this review led to the decision to sell our general aviation piston engine businesses which sale was completed in april 2011 

our ability to dispose of or exit businesses that may no longer be aligned with our growth strategy will depend on many factors including the terms and conditions of any asset purchase and sale agreement as well as industry business and economic conditions we cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to sell nonstrategic businesses on terms that are acceptable to us or at all also if the sale of any nonstrategic business cannot be consummated or is not practical alternative courses of action including closure may not be available to us or may be more costly than anticipated 

natural and manmade disasters could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

several of our facilities as a result of their locations could be subject to a catastrophic loss caused by earthquakes hurricanes tornados floods ice storms or other natural disasters many of our production facilities and our headquarters are located in california and thus are in areas with above average seismic activity and may also be at risk of damage in wildfires teledyne dalsa’s facility in quebec has in the past been impacted by severe ice storms in addition we have manufacturing facilities in the southeastern united states and texas that have been threatened and struck by major hurricanes our facilities in alabama florida nebraska and tennessee have also been threatened by tornados on april 27 2011 tornados caused substantial damage in huntsville alabama while teledyne brown engineering’s main facility in huntsville alabama incurred minimal building damage and business interruption the facility was without power for several days if any of our california facilities including our california headquarters were to experience a catastrophic earthquake or wildfire loss or if any of our alabama florida louisiana nebraska tennessee or texas facilities were to experience a catastrophic hurricane storm tornado or other natural disaster or if dalsa’s facilities in quebec experience longterm loss of electrical power such event could disrupt our operations delay production shipments and revenue and result in large expenses to repair or replace the facility or facilities while teledyne has property insurance to partially reimburse it for losses caused by windstorm and earth movement such insurance would not 

  

cover all possible losses in addition our existing disaster recovery and business continuity plans including those relating to our information technology systems may not be fully responsive to or minimize losses associated with catastrophic events 

the environmental disaster triggered by the deepwater horizon rig explosion and oil spill in 2010 resulted in a moratorium on offshore oil and gas production in the gulf of mexico that adversely affected the results of operations of some of our teledyne oil and gas businesses although such adverse impact was offset in part by the products we manufacture that supported wellcapping and environmental cleanup efforts new environmental regulations enacted in the wake of this oil spill have resulted in increased compliance costs to some of our teledyne oil  gas businesses similar future manmade disasters that limit or cease offshore oil and gas production or further exploration in the regions in which we sell our products could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

disasters that do not directly impact us can have an indirect adverse impact on our business for example in 2011 the earthquake in northern japan and the related tsunami and severe flooding in thailand resulted in certain of our customers delaying orders for our products because they were unable to obtain critical supplies from vendors in the impacted areas 

we may not be able to enforce or protect our intellectual property rights which may harm our ability to compete and harm our business 

our ability to enforce our patents copyrights software licenses and other intellectual property rights is subject to general litigation risks as well as uncertainty as to the enforceability of our intellectual property rights in various countries when we seek to enforce our rights we are often subject to claims that the intellectual property right is invalid is otherwise not enforceable or is licensed to the party against whom we are asserting a claim in addition as our teledyne controls business has experienced our assertion of intellectual property rights often results in the other party seeking to assert alleged intellectual property rights of its own or assert other claims against us if we are not ultimately successful in defending ourselves against these claims in litigation we may not be able to sell a particular product or family of products due to an injunction or we may have to pay damages that could in turn harm our results of operations our inability to enforce our intellectual property rights under these circumstances may harm our competitive position and our business 

our business and operations could suffer in the event of cyber security breaches 

attempts by others to gain unauthorized access to our information technology systems are becoming more sophisticated and are sometimes successful these attempts which might be related to industrial foreign government espionage or activism include covertly introducing malware to our computers and networks performing reconnaissance and impersonating authorized users among other activities we continue to update our infrastructure to protect against security incidents and to prevent their recurrence and company personnel have been tasked to detect and investigate such incidents but it is possible that we might not be aware of an incident or its magnitude and effects the theft unauthorized use or publication of our intellectual property andor confidential business information could harm our competitive position reduce the value of our investment in research and development and other strategic initiatives or otherwise adversely affect our business to the extent that any security breach results in inappropriate disclosure of confidential information of third parties or the government we may incur liability or the loss of security clearances as a result in addition we expect to continue devoting additional resources to the security of our information technology systems 

our financial statements are based on estimates required by gaap and actual results may differ materially from those estimated under different assumptions or conditions 

our financial statements are prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states these principles require our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period for example estimates are used when accounting for items such as asset valuations allowances for doubtful accounts depreciation and amortization impairment 

  

assessments employee benefits taxes recall costs aircraft product and general liability and contingencies while we base our estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances at the time made actual results may differ materially from those estimated 

while we believe our internal control systems are effective there are inherent limitations in all control systems and misstatements resulting from error or fraud may occur and may not be detected 

we continue to take action to assure compliance with the internal controls disclosure controls and other requirements of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer cannot guarantee that our internal controls and disclosure controls will prevent all possible errors or all fraud a control system no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met in addition the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefit of controls must be relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no system of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within the company have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake further controls can be circumvented by individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more persons or by management override of the controls the design of any system of controls is also based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions over time a control may be inadequate because of changes in conditions or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate because of inherent limitations in a costeffective control system misstatements resulting from error or fraud may occur and may not be detected 

provisions of our governing documents applicable law and our change in control severance agreements could make an acquisition of teledyne more difficult 

our restated certificate of incorporation our amended and restated bylaws and the general corporation law of the state of delaware contain several provisions that could make the acquisition of control of teledyne in a transaction not approved by our board of directors more difficult we have also entered into change in control severance agreements with 18 members of our management which could have an antitakeover effect these provisions may prevent or discourage attempts to acquire our company 

the market price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly since we became a public company and could continue to do so 

since we became an independent public company on november 29 1999 the market price of our common stock has fluctuated substantially and fluctuations in our stock price could continue among the factors that could affect our stock price are 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

  

  

 the stock markets in general and the markets for high technology companies in particular have experienced a high degree of volatility that is not necessarily related to the operating performance of these companies we cannot provide assurances as to our stock price

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation tableend teledyne technologies incorporated provides enabling technologies for industrial growth markets we have evolved from a company that was primarily focused on aerospace and defense to one that serves multiple markets that require advanced technology and high reliability these markets include deepwater oil and gas exploration and production oceanographic research air and water quality environmental monitoring factory automation and medical imaging our products include monitoring instrumentation for marine and environmental applications harsh environment interconnects digital imaging sensors and cameras aircraft information management systems and defense electronic and satellite communication subsystems we also supply engineered systems for defense space environmental and nuclear applications we differentiate ourselves from many of our direct competitors by having a customer and company sponsored applied research center that augments our product development expertise 

strategyoverview 

our strategy continues to emphasize growth in our core markets of instrumentation digital imaging aerospace and defense electronics and government engineered systems our core markets are characterized by high barriers to entry and include specialized products and services not likely to be commoditized we intend to strengthen and expand our core businesses with targeted acquisitions and through product development we aggressively pursue operational excellence to continually improve our margins and earnings at teledyne operational excellence includes the rapid integration of the businesses we acquire using complementary technology across our businesses and internal research and development we seek to create new products to grow our company and expand our addressable markets we continue to evaluate our businesses to ensure that they are aligned with our strategy 

consistent with this strategy we made two acquisitions and acquired a minority interest investment in the first quarter of 2011 on april 19 2011 we completed the sale of our general aviation piston engine businesses which comprised the former aerospace engines and components segment accordingly our consolidated financial statements have been restated to classify the aerospace engines and components segment as a discontinued operation 

on february 12 2011 the company acquired the stock of dalsa corporation “dalsa” dalsa designs and manufactures digital image capture products primarily consisting of high performance sensors cameras and software for use in industrial scientific medical and professional applications products as well as specialty semiconductors and micro electro mechanical systems “mems” among other things our combined digital imaging technologies should allow us to develop new infrared and visible light products for our respective markets and customers the company acquired dalsa for an aggregate purchase price of 3395 million in cash headquartered in waterloo ontario canada dalsa had annual revenues of cad 2123 million for its fiscal year ended december 2010 dalsa operates within the digital imaging segment 

in addition to the acquisition of dalsa in 2011 the company completed the acquisition of a majority interest in nova sensors “nova” for total consideration of 51 million in cash and a minority interest in optech incorporated “optech” for 189 million nova produces compact shortwave and midwave infrared cameras and operates within the digital imaging segment optech is a laserbased survey and digital imaging company teledyne funded the purchases primarily from borrowings under its credit facility and cash on hand we also bought the remaining minority interest in energy systems for 32 million in 2011 

in 2011 sales totaled 19419 million compared with sales of 16442 million for 2010 our 2011 net income totaled 2552 million or 684 per diluted share compared to 1205 million or 327 per diluted share in 2010 net income for 2011 excluding our discontinued operations was 1421 million or 381 per diluted share compared with 1199 million or 325 per diluted share for 2010 the increase in revenue included incremental sales from acquisitions of 2496 million in addition each business segment experienced higher organic growth except for the engineered systems segment the revenue decrease for the engineered systems segment primarily reflected lower sales from space and defense programs with the recent acquisition of dalsa as well as growth in our commercial markets our business mix has changed and for 2011 teledyne’s sales were split 64 commercial and 36 government this has changed from an approximate 55 commercial and 45 government split ten years ago 

  

in addition to the above events on february 25 2011 we replaced our 5900 million credit facility that was set to expire in july 2011 with a 5500 million credit facility the new facility together with the 2500 million in senior notes issued in september 2010 and operating cash flow will provide teledyne with the ability to fund working capital needs capital expenditures voluntary pension contributions debt service requirements and acquisitions for 2012 

recent acquisitions 

the company spent 3667 million 679 million and 271 million on acquisitions in 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively the acquisitions made in 2011 are described above in 2010 teledyne acquired intelek plc “intelek” for 435 million intelek primarily designs and manufactures electronic systems for satellite and microwave communications and aerospace manufacturing in 2010 teledyne also acquired optimum optical systems inc “optimum” a designer and manufacturer of custom optics and optomechanical assemblies and hafmynd ehf “gavia” a designer and manufacturer of the gavia autonomous underwater vehicle in 2009 the company purchased all of the remaining 141 minority interest in ocean design inc now known as teledyne odi “odi” for 255 million also in 2009 the company purchased the assets of a marine sensor product line for 14 million see note 3 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information about our recent acquisitions see also note 18 to our consolidated financial statements for information about our fiscal year 2012 acquisition of varisystems inc “varisystems”

cost of sales in total dollars was higher in 2011 compared with 2010 and primarily reflected the impact of higher sales cost of sales as a percentage of sales for 2011 was 665 compared with 698 for 2010 the lower cost of sales percentage reflected the impact of the dalsa cost structure which has a lower cost of sales percentage than the overall teledyne cost of sales percentage 

selling general and administrative expenses including research and development and bid and proposal expense in total dollars were higher in 2011 compared with 2010 the increase reflected the impact of higher sales higher acquired intangible asset amortization of 97 million and higher research and development costs of 414 million corporate administrative expense in 2011 was higher by 49 million compared with 2010 and reflected higher employee compensation and professional fee expenses for 2011 we recorded a total of 58 million in stock option expense of which 21 million was recorded as corporate expense and 37 million was recorded in segment results for 2010 we recorded a total of 47 million in stock option expense of which 17 million was recorded as corporate expense and 30 million was recorded in segment results selling general and administrative expenses for 2011 as a percentage of sales increased to 218 compared with 193 for 2010 and reflected the impact of acquisition related expenses higher research and development costs and the dalsa cost structure which has a higher selling general and administrative expense percentage than the overall teledyne selling general and administrative expense percentage 

included in operating profit in 2011 was domestic pension expense of 67 million in accordance with us government cost accounting standards “cas” 126 million was recoverable from certain government contracts included in operating profit in 2010 was domestic pension expense of 48 million in accordance with cas 96 million was recoverable from certain government contracts pension expense determined under cas can generally be recovered through the pricing of products and services sold to the us government 

the company’s effective tax rate for 2011 was 329 compared with 309 for 2010 fiscal years 2011 and 2010 included net tax credits of 24 million and 125 million respectively which were primarily research and development tax credits excluding the net tax credits the effective tax rates for 2011 and 2010 would have been 340 and 381 respectively 

  

during the next twelve months it is reasonably possible that tax audit resolutions and expirations of the statutes of limitations could reduce unrecognized tax benefits by 64 million either because our tax positions are sustained on audit because the company agrees to their disallowance or because of the expiration of the statutes of limitations 

sales under contracts with the us government were approximately 36 of sales in 2011 and 44 of sales in 2010 sales to international customers represented approximately 36 of sales in 2011 and 29 of sales in 2010 

total interest expense including credit facility fees and other bank charges was 167 million in 2011 and 69 million in 2010 interest income was 05 million in 2011 and 04 million in 2010 the increase in interest expense primarily reflected the impact of higher outstanding debt levels and higher overall average interest rates from our new credit facility and our senior notes 

other income in 2011 included income of 23 million related to the reduction of an environmental reserve determined to be no longer needed and a 45 million pretax charge to write off the company’s minority investment in a private company other income in 2011 and in 2010 each included an insurance benefit of 10 million

financial condition liquidity and capital resources 

principal capital requirements 

our principal capital requirements are to fund working capital needs capital expenditures voluntary and required pension contributions debt service requirements and acquisitions including the acquisition of varisystems it is anticipated that operating cash flow together with available borrowings under the credit 

  

facility described below will be sufficient to meet these requirements and could be used to fund some acquisitions in the year 2012 to support acquisitions we may need to raise additional capital our liquidity is not dependent upon the use of offbalance sheet financial arrangements we have no offbalance sheet financing arrangements that incorporate the use of special purpose entities or unconsolidated entities 

revolving credit agreement and senior notes 

teledyne’s amended and restated credit facility had lender commitments totaling 5900 million and was set to expire on july 14 2011 on february 25 2011 teledyne refinanced the then existing 5900 million credit facility by terminating the facility and entering into a new facility that has lender commitments totaling 5500 million the new facility has a termination date of february 25 2016 excluding interest and fees no payments are due under the 5500 million facility until it matures borrowings under our credit facility are at variable rates which are at our option tied to a eurocurrency rate equal to libor london interbank offered rate plus an applicable rate or a base rate as defined in our credit agreement eurocurrency rate loans may be denominated in us dollars or an alternative currency as defined in the agreement eurocurrency or libor based loans under the facility typically have terms of one two three or six months and the interest rate for each such loan is subject to change if the loan is continued or converted following the applicable maturity date base rate loans have interest rates that primarily fluctuate with changes in the prime rate interest rates are also subject to change based on our consolidated leverage ratio as defined in the credit agreement the credit agreement also provides for facility fees that vary between 020 and 045 of the credit line depending on our consolidated leverage ratio as calculated from time to time 

on september 15 2010 the company issued 2500 million in aggregate principal amount of private placement senior notes at par the interest rates for the notes were determined on april 14 2010 the company used the proceeds of the private placement senior notes to pay down amounts outstanding under the company’s then existing 5900 million credit facility 

in 2010 teledyne entered into cash flow hedges of forecasted interest payments associated with the then anticipated issuance of fixed rate debt in the second quarter teledyne terminated the cash flow hedges for a total payment of 06 million which was deferred in accumulated other comprehensive loss and will be reclassified to interest expense through september 2020 as of january 1 2012 the remaining unamortized loss of 05 million was included in accumulated other comprehensive loss in the stockholders’ equity section of the balance sheet 

longterm debt consisted of the following in millions 

 

 the company also has 148 million in capital leases of which 14 million is current at january 1 2012 teledyne technologies had 135 million in outstanding letters of credit 

the credit agreements require the company to comply with various financial and operating covenants including maintaining certain consolidated leverage and interest coverage ratios as well as minimum net worth levels and limits on acquired debt at january 1 2012 the company was in compliance with these covenants and we had a significant amount of margin between required financial covenant ratios and our actual ratios currently we do not believe our ability to undertake additional debt financing if needed is reasonably likely to be materially impacted by debt restrictions under our credit agreements subject to our complying with required financial covenants listed in the table below at january 1 2012 the required financial covenant ratios and the actual ratios were as follows 

  

2500 million private placement notes due 2015 2017 and 2020 

 

 5500 million credit facility expires february 2016 

 

  

  

 available borrowing capacity under the 5500 million credit facility which is reduced by borrowings and outstanding letters of credit was 4885 million at january 1 2012 teledyne also has a 50 million uncommitted credit line which permits credit extensions up to 50 million plus an incremental 20 million solely for standby letters of credit this credit line is utilized as needed for periodic cash needs no amounts are outstanding under this facility at january 1 2012 the maximum amount that could be borrowed under our 5500 million credit facility as of january 1 2012 while still remaining in compliance with our consolidated leverage ratio covenant was 4885 million 

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our expected cash outflows resulting from financial contracts and commitments at january 1 2012 we have not included information on our normal recurring purchases of materials for use in our operations these amounts are generally consistent from year to year closely reflect our levels of production and are not longterm in nature in millions 

 

  

  

  

   

at january 1 2012 we are not required to make any cash contributions to the domestic qualified pension plan for 2012 teledyne made a voluntary pretax contribution to its domestic qualified pension plan of 500 million on january 9 2012 and expects to make an additional 428 million pretax contribution in the third quarter of 2012 teledyne has no required or scheduled contributions to its foreign pension plan for 2012 our minimum funding requirements after 2011 as set forth by erisa are dependent on several factors as discussed under “accounting for pension plans” in the critical accounting policies section of this management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation estimates beyond 2012 have not been provided due to the significant uncertainty of these amounts which are subject to change until the company’s pension assumptions can be updated at the appropriate times in addition certain pension contributions are eligible for future recovery through the pricing of products and services to the us government under certain government contracts therefore the amounts noted are not necessarily indicative of the impact these contributions may have on our liquidity we also have payments due under our other postretirement benefits plans these plans are not required to be funded in advance but are pay as you go see further discussion in note 12 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in addition for covered active salaried employees in 2011 the company approved a plan amendment to change the rate at which pension benefits will accrue on or after march 1 2012 the pension benefit formula will be changed from a “final average pay” calculation to a “career average pay” approach this amendment reduced the pension benefit obligation by 433 million in 2011 teledyne intends to continue to monitor and manage its defined pension benefit plan obligation and may take additional actions in the future 

operating activities 

in 2011 net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations was 2195 million compared with 1271 million in 2010 and 1604 million in 2009 the higher net cash provided for 2011 compared with 2010 reflected the impact of higher net income lower income tax payments of 335 million and lower deferred accounts receivable partially offset by higher pretax pension contributions of 242 million 

the lower net cash provided for 2010 compared with 2009 reflected higher income tax payments of 492 million higher deferred accounts receivable and higher accounts receivable due to timing of sales partially offset by lower pretax pension contributions of 719 million 

free cash flow cash from operating activities from continuing operations less capital expenditures was 1778 million compared with 961 million in 2010 and 1269 million in 2009 adjusted free cash flow eliminates the impact of pension contributions on a net of tax basis and was 2218 million compared with 1242 million in 2010 and 1980 million in 2009 

 

   

  

  

working capital 

working capital decreased to 2685 million at yearend 2011 compared with 3068 million at yearend 2010 the decrease reflected the use of cash on hand at january 2 2011 to pay down longterm debt and a reduction in income taxes payable from year end 2010 

balance sheet changes 

the changes in the following selected components of teledyne’s balance sheet are discussed below in millions 

 

 the higher cash balance in 2010 reflected unused cash proceeds from the private placement of debt in september 2010 the higher balances in inventories property plant and equipment goodwill acquired intangible assets primarily reflect the impact of the dalsa acquisition the higher balances in accrued liabilities short term includes the impact of the dalsa acquisition as well as higher customer advances the higher balances in other longterm liabilities primarily reflect deferred tax balances and other tax reserves related to dalsa the accumulated other comprehensive loss increase primarily reflects the noncash adjustment of 421 million related to the increase in the unfunded pension liability in 2011 and 93 million foreign currency changes 

investing activities 

net cash used in investing activities included capital expenditures as presented below in millions 

capital expenditures

other matters 

income taxes 

the company’s effective tax rate for 2011 was 329 compared with 309 for 2010 and 300 for 2009 fiscal years 2011 2010 and 2009 included net tax credits of 24 million 125 million and 150 million respectively primarily research and development tax credits excluding these items the company’s effective tax rates for fiscal years 2011 2010 and 2009 would have been 340 381 and 391 respectively the lower 2011 effective tax rate compared with the 2010 effective tax rate excluding tax credits primarily reflected a 

  

change in the proportion of domestic and international income and foreign research and development tax credits based on the company’s history of operating earnings expectations of future operating earnings and potential tax planning strategies it is more likely than not that the deferred income tax assets at january 1 2012 will be realized 

costs and pricing 

inflationary trends in recent years have been moderate current inventory costs the increasing costs of equipment and other costs are considered in establishing sales pricing policies the company emphasizes cost containment in all aspects of its business 

hedging activities market risk disclosures 

teledyne transacts business in various foreign currencies and has international sales and expenses denominated in foreign currencies subjecting the company to foreign currency risk the company’s primary objective is to protect the united states dollar value of future cash flows and minimize the volatility of reported earnings due to the february 2011 acquisition of dalsa the company began to utilize foreign currency forward contracts to reduce the volatility of cash flows primarily related to forecasted revenue and expenses denominated in canadian dollars in addition from time to time the company may utilize foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate foreign exchange rate risk associated with foreigncurrencydenominated monetary assets and liabilities including intercompany receivables and payables and as of january 1 2012 teledyne had foreign currency contracts of this type to buy canadian dollars and to sell us dollars totaling 165 million and these contracts had a fair value of 05 million the gains and losses on these derivatives which are not designated as hedging instruments under asc 815 derivatives and hedging “asc 815” are intended to at a minimum partially offset the transaction gains and losses recognized in earnings under asc 815 all derivatives are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value as discussed below the accounting for gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value depends on the use of the derivative and whether it is designated and qualifies for hedge accounting teledyne technologies does not use foreign currency forward contracts for speculative or trading purposes 

in february 2011 teledyne technologies began utilizing foreign currency forward contracts which were designated and qualify as cash flow hedges the effectiveness of the cash flow hedge contracts excluding time value is assessed prospectively and retrospectively on a monthly basis using regression analysis as well as using other timing and probability criteria to receive hedge accounting treatment all hedging relationships are formally documented at the inception of the hedges and must be highly effective in offsetting changes to future cash flows on hedged transactions the effective portion of the cash flow hedge contracts’ gains or losses resulting from changes in the fair value of these hedges is initially reported net of tax as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders’ equity until the underlying hedged item is reflected in our consolidated statements of income at which time the effective amount in accumulated other comprehensive income is reclassified to cost of sales in our consolidated statements of income the company expects to reclassify a loss of approximately 23 million over the next 12 months based on the year end 2011 exchange rate 

in the event that the gains or losses in accumulated other comprehensive income “oci” are deemed to be ineffective the ineffective portion of gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value if any is reclassified to other income and expense in the event that the underlying forecasted transactions do not occur or it becomes remote that they will occur within the defined hedge period the gains or losses on the related cash flow hedges will be reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income to other income and expense during the current reporting period all forecasted transactions occurred and therefore there were no such gains or losses reclassified to other income and expense as of january 1 2012 teledyne had foreign currency forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges to buy canadian dollars and to sell us dollars totaling 607 million and these contracts had a fair value of 20 million these foreign currency forward contracts have maturities ranging from january 2012 to february 2013 

notwithstanding our efforts to mitigate portions of our foreign currency exchange rate risks there can be no assurance that our hedging activities will adequately protect us against the risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations a hypothetical 10 percent appreciation of the us dollar from its value at january 1 2012 would decrease the fair value of our foreign currency forward contracts associated with our cash flow hedging activities by 72 million a hypothetical 10 percent depreciation of the us dollar from its value at january 1 2012 would increase the fair value of our foreign currency forward contracts associated with our cash flow hedging activities by 72 million 

  

borrowings under our credit facility are at fixed rates that vary with the term and timing of each loan under the facility loans under the facility typically have terms of one two three or six months and the interest rate for each such loan is subject to change if the loan is continued or converted following the applicable maturity date interest rates are also subject to change based on our debt to earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization ratio as of january 1 2012 we had 480 million outstanding indebtedness under our 5500 million credit facility any borrowings under the company’s revolving credit line are based on a fluctuating market interest rate and consequently the fair value of any outstanding debt should not be affected materially by changes in market interest rates a 100 basis point increase in interest rates would result in an increase in annual interest expense of approximately 05 million assuming the 480 million in debt was outstanding for the full year 

we believe that adequate controls are in place to monitor any hedging activities our primary exposure to market risk relates to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates we periodically evaluate these risks and have taken measures to mitigate these risks we own assets and operate facilities in countries that have been politically stable 

related party transactions 

on april 12 2011 our chairman president and chief executive officer retired as a director of the bank of new york mellon corporation one of our other directors is currently a director of the bank of new york mellon corporation the bank of new york mellon corporation is the successor to mellon financial corporation following its merger with the bank of new york in 2007 another of our directors was a former chief executive officer of mellon financial corporation all transactions with the bank of new york mellon corporation and its respective affiliates are effected under normal commercial terms and we believe that our relationships with the bank of new york mellon corporation and its respective affiliates are armslength the bank of new york mellon corporation was one of 13 lenders under our prior 5900 million credit facility having committed up to 900 million under the facility the bank of new york mellon corporation is one of 12 lenders under our new 5500 million credit facility having committed up to 450 million under the facility the bank of new york mellon corporation also provides cash management services serves as trustee for the teledyne technologies incorporated pension plan and through its subsidiaries and affiliates provides asset management and transition management services for the pension plan in 2011 mellon investor services llc dba bny mellon shareowner services served as our transfer agent and registrar and as a proxy solicitor for our 2011 annual meeting and also handled administration of our stock options on january 1 2012 bny mellon’s shareowners services business was acquired by computershare 

environmental 

we are subject to various federal state local and international environmental laws and regulations which require that we investigate and remediate the effects of the release or disposal of materials at sites associated with past and present operations these include sites at which teledyne has been identified as a potentially responsible party under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act commonly known as superfund and comparable state laws we are currently involved in the investigation and remediation of a number of sites reserves for environmental investigation and remediation totaled 32 million at january 1 2012 and 52 million at january 2 2011 the decrease from 2010 reflects a 23 million reduction of environmental reserves determined to be no longer needed as investigation and remediation of these sites proceed and new information is received the company expects that accruals will be adjusted to reflect new information based on current information we do not believe that future environmental costs in excess of those already accrued will materially and adversely affect our financial condition or liquidity however resolution of one or more of these environmental matters or future accrual adjustments in any one reporting period could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations for that period see also our environmental risk factor disclosure beginning at page 22 

for additional discussion of environmental matters see notes 2 and 15 to the notes to consolidated financial statements 

government contracts 

we perform work on a number of contracts with the department of defense and other agencies and departments of the us government including subcontracts with government prime contractors sales under these contracts with the us government which included contracts with the department of defense were approximately 

  

36 of total sales in 2011 44 of total sales in 2010 and 47 of total sales in 2009 for a summary of sales to the us government by segment see note 13 to the notes to consolidated financial statements sales to the department of defense represented approximately 29 34 and 36 of total sales for 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively see also our government contracts risks factor disclosure beginning at page 14 

performance under government contracts has certain inherent risks that could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business results of operations and financial condition government contracts are conditioned upon the continuing availability of congressional appropriations which usually occurs on a fiscal year basis even though contract performance may take more than one year 

for information on accounts receivable from the us government see note 5 to the notes to consolidated financial statements 

estimates and reserves 

our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent liabilities on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including those related to product returns and replacements allowance for doubtful accounts inventories intangible assets income taxes warranty obligations pension and other postretirement benefits longterm contracts environmental workers’ compensation and general liability employee dental and medical benefits and other contingencies and litigation we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances at the time the results of which form the basis for making our judgments actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions in some cases such differences may be material see “other matters — critical accounting policies” 

the following table reflects significant reserves and valuation accounts which are estimates and based on judgments as described above at january 1 2012 and january 2 2011 in millions 

reserves and valuation accounts a 

 

  

  

 some of the company’s products are subject to specified warranties and the company provides for the estimated cost of product warranties we regularly assess the adequacy of our preexisting warranty liabilities and adjust amounts as necessary based on a review of historic warranty experience with respect to the applicable business or products as well as the length and actual terms of the warranties which are typically one year the product warranty reserve is included in current accrued liabilities and other longterm liabilities on the balance sheet changes in the company’s product warranty reserve are as follows in millions 

 

   

critical accounting policies 

the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with united states generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the notes to the financial statements some of those judgments can be subjective and complex and therefore actual results could differ materially from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions our critical accounting policies are those that are reflective of significant judgment complexity and uncertainty and may potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions we have identified the following as critical accounting policies revenue recognition accounting for pension plans accounting for business combinations goodwill and other longlived assets and accounting for income taxes for additional discussion of the application of these and other accounting policies see note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition 

commercial sales and sales from us government fixedprice type contracts are generally recorded as shipments are made or as services are rendered occasionally for certain fixedprice type contracts that require substantial performance over a long time period generally one or more years revenues are recorded under the percentageofcompletion method we measure the extent of progress toward completion using the unitsofdelivery method costtocost method or upon attainment of scheduled performance milestones which could be time event or expense driven occasionally invoices are submitted to and paid by the customer under a contractual agreement which has a different time schedule than the related revenue recognition sales under costreimbursement contracts usually from the us government are recorded as allowable costs are incurred and fees are earned 

the development of cost of sales percentages used to record costs under certain fixedprice type contracts and fees under certain costreimbursement type contracts requires management’s judgment to make reasonably dependable cost estimates for the design manufacture and delivery of products and services generally over a long time period since certain fixedprice and costreimbursement type contracts extend over a long period of time the impact of revisions in cost and revenue estimates during the progress of work may adjust the current period earnings on a cumulative catchup basis this method recognizes in the current period the cumulative effect of the changes on current and prior quarters for fixedprice contracts if the current contract estimate indicates a loss a provision is made for the total anticipated loss in the period that it becomes evident contract cost and revenue estimates for significant contracts are generally reviewed and reassessed quarterly these types of contracts and estimates are most frequently related to our sales to the us government or sales to other defense contractors for ultimate sale to the us government the company follows the revenue recognition criteria under accounting standards codification “asc” 60510s991 revenue recognition for our sales to the us government in 2011 2010 and 2009 operating income as a percent of sales did not vary by more than 21 if operating income as a percent of sales to the us government had been higher or lower by 21 in 2011 the company’s operating income would have changed by approximately 142 million 

accounting for pension plans 

the company’s accounting for its defined benefit pension plan requires that amounts recognized in financial statements be determined on an actuarial basis rather than as contributions are made to the plan a significant element in determining the company’s pension income or expense is the expected return on plan assets as well as the assumed discount rate on pension liabilities the company has assumed based upon the types of securities the plan assets are invested in and the longterm historical returns of these investments that the longterm expected return on pension assets will be 825 in 2012 for its domestic pension plan and 66 for its foreign pension plan the assumed discount rate will be 55 in 2012 for its domestic pension plan and 47 for its foreign pension plan the company’s longterm expected return on pension assets used in 2011 was 825 for its domestic pension plans as a result of the sale of the piston engine businesses plan liabilities and assets were remeasured as of the april 19 2011 sale date plan liabilities and expense for the remainder of the year after the sale date were measured using a discount rate of 615 updated from 590 that was used from the beginning of the year through the sale date for its domestic pension plans for its foreign pension plan the company’s longterm expected return on pension assets used in 2011 was 58 and the assumed discount rate 

  

used in 2011 was 54 the actual rate of return on pension assets was a negative 04 in 2011 and a positive return of 123 in 2010 for its domestic pension plans the actual rate of return on pension assets was a negative 27 in 2011 and a positive return of 121 in 2010 for its foreign pension plan if the actual rate of return on pension assets is above the projection the company may be able to reduce its contributions to the pension trust if the actual rate of return on pension assets is below the projection the company may be required to make additional contributions to the pension trust the company made pretax contributions of 690 million to its pension benefit plans in 2011 and made a 500 million pretax contribution on january 9 2012 and currently anticipates making an additional pretax cash contribution of approximately 428 million to its pension benefit plans in the third quarter 2012 before recovery from the us government the assumed longterm rate of return on assets is applied to the marketrelated value of plan assets at the end of the previous year this produces the expected return on plan assets that is included in the annual pension income or expense calculation for the current year the cumulative difference between this expected return and the actual return on plan assets is deferred and amortized into pension income or expense over future periods at yearend 2011 the company has a 2082 million noncash reduction to stockholders’ equity and a longterm additional liability of 3399 million related to its pension plans at yearend 2010 the company had a 1680 million noncash reduction to stockholders’ equity and a longterm additional liability of 2766 million related to its pension plans see note 12 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional pension disclosures 

differences in the discount rate and expected longterm rate of return on assets within the indicated range would have had the following impact on 2011 pension expense in millions 

 

 see note 12 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional pension disclosures 

accounting for business combinations goodwill acquired intangible assets and other longlived assets 

the company accounts for goodwill and purchased intangible assets under asc 80 in all acquisitions the results are included in the company’s consolidated financial statements from the date of each respective acquisition business acquisitions are accounted for under the purchase method by assigning the purchase price to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at their fair values and the excess of the purchase price over the amounts assigned is recorded as goodwill purchased intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives adjustments to fair value assessments are recorded to goodwill over the purchase price allocation period 

goodwill and acquired intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized we review goodwill and acquired indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable the company also performs an annual impairment test in the fourth quarter of each year we would test goodwill for impairment between annual tests if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce our enterprise fair value below its book value these events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate including a significant sustained decline in an entity’s market value legal factors operating performance indicators competition sale or disposition of a significant portion of the business or other factors based on the annual impairment test completed in the fourth quarter of 2011 no impairment of goodwill or intangible assets with indefinite lives was indicated 

for goodwill impairment testing the company estimates the fair value of the reporting units using a discounted cash flow model based on our best estimate of amounts and timing of future revenues and cash flows and our most recent business and strategic plans and compares the estimated fair value to the carrying value of the reporting unit including goodwill the discounted cash flow model requires judgmental assumptions about projected revenue growth future operating margins discount rates and terminal values there are inherent 

  

uncertainties related to these assumptions and management’s judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill impairment while the company believes it has made reasonable estimates and assumptions to calculate the fair value of its reporting units it is possible a material change could occur if actual results are not consistent with management’s estimates and assumptions goodwill may be overstated and a charge would need to be taken against net earnings 

as of january 1 2012 the company had 33 reporting units for goodwill impairment testing the carrying value of goodwill included in the company’s individual reporting units ranges from 04 million to 1697 million the company’s analysis in 2011 indicated that in all instances the fair value of the company’s reporting units exceeded their carrying values and consequently did not result in an impairment charge the excess of the estimated fair value over the carrying value expressed as a percentage of carrying value of the respective reporting unit for each of the company’s reporting units as of the fourth quarter of 2011 the annual testing date ranged from approximately 20 to 1700 

changes in these projections could affect the estimated fair value of certain of the company’s reporting units and could result in a goodwill impairment charge in a future period in order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations used in the goodwill impairment test the company applied a hypothetical 10 decrease to the fair values of each reporting unit and compared those values to the reporting unit carrying values based on this sensitivity analysis the company did not identify any goodwill impairment charges 

the impairment test for indefinitelived intangibles other than goodwill primarily trademarks and trade names consists of a comparison of the fair value of the indefinitelived intangible asset to the carrying value of the asset as of the impairment testing date the company estimates the fair value of its indefinitelived intangibles using a discounted cash flow model based on our best estimate of amounts and timing of future revenues and cash flows and our most recent business and strategic plans and compares the estimated fair value to the carrying value of the asset the estimated fair values significantly exceed the carrying value for each of the company’s indefinitelived intangible assets as of the fourth quarter of 2011 the annual testing date 

accounting for income taxes 

income tax expense and deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect management’s assessment of actual future taxes to be paid on items reflected in the financial statements significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes uncertainty exists regarding tax positions taken in previously filed tax returns still under examination and positions expected to be taken in future returns deferred tax assets and liabilities arise due to differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and tax carryforwards although we believe our income tax expense and deferred tax assets and liabilities are reasonable no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome will not be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals to the extent that the final tax outcome is different than the amounts recorded such differences will impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made the provision for income taxes includes the impact of uncertain tax benefits that are considered appropriate as well as the related net interest 

significant judgment is required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets in assessing the need for a valuation allowance we consider all available evidence including past operating results estimates of future taxable income and the feasibility of tax planning strategies in the event that we change our determination as to the amount of deferred tax assets that can be realized we will adjust our valuation allowance with a corresponding impact to the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made 

our effective tax rates differ from the statutory rate primarily due to the tax impact of the prior year research and development tax credits state taxes tax audit settlements and non us subsidiaries taxed at rates less than 35 the effective tax rate was 329 309 and 300 in 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively 

  

the following presents a rollforward of our unrecognized tax benefits in millions 

 

 we recognized interest related to unrecognized tax benefits of 17 million and 09 million within the provision for income taxes in our statements of operations for fiscal year 2011 and 2010 respectively 

as of january 1 2012 we estimated that the entire balance of unrecognized tax benefits if resolved in our favor would positively impact the effective tax rate and therefore be recognized as additional tax benefits in our income statement 

we file income tax returns in the united states federal jurisdiction and in various states and foreign jurisdictions the company has substantially concluded on all us federal income tax matters for all years through 2007 california income tax matters for all years through 2006 and canadian income tax matters for all years through 2003 substantially all other material state and local and foreign income tax matters have been concluded for years through 2006 

the company anticipates the total unrecognized tax benefit for various federal and state tax items may be reduced by 64 million due to the expiration of statutes of limitation and settlements with tax authorities for various federal state and canadian tax issues in the next 12 months 

recent accounting pronouncements 

in 2011 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued new accounting guidance that amends some fair value measurement principles and disclosure requirements the new guidance states that the concepts of highest and best use and valuation premise are only relevant when measuring the fair value of nonfinancial assets and prohibits the grouping of financial instruments for purposes of determining their fair values when the unit of account is specified in other guidance the guidance is effective for periods beginning on or after december 15 2011 we do not anticipate that this adoption will have a significant impact on our financial position or results of operations 

in 2011 the fasb issued new disclosure guidance related to the presentation of the statement of comprehensive income this guidance eliminates the current option to report other comprehensive income and its components in the consolidated statement of stockholders’ equity the requirement to present reclassification adjustments out of accumulated other comprehensive income on the face of the consolidated statement of income has been deferred the guidance is effective for periods beginning on or after december 15 2011 the adoption will not have any impact on our financial position or results of operations but will impact our financial statement presentation 

in 2011 the fasb issued new accounting guidance that simplifies goodwill impairment tests the new guidance states that a “qualitative” assessment may be performed to determine whether further impairment testing is necessary the guidance is effective for periods beginning on or after december 15 2011 we do not anticipate that this adoption will have a significant impact on our financial position or results of operations 

in december 2010 the fasb issued new accounting guidance which enhances the disclosure requirements and requires description of the nature and amount of any material nonrecurring pro forma adjustments directly attributable to a business combination the company adopted the provision of asu 201029 in fiscal year 2011 since the requirements are disclosure oriented the adoption did not have any impact on the company’s consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

safe harbor cautionary statement regarding forwardlooking data 

this management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation contains forwardlooking statements as defined in the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 directly and indirectly relating to earnings growth opportunities product sales capital expenditures pension matters stock option compensation expense taxes and strategic plans all statements made in this management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation that are not historical in nature should be considered forwardlooking actual results could differ materially from these forwardlooking statements many factors could change the anticipated results including disruptions in the global economy changes in demand for products sold to the defense electronics instrumentation digital imaging energy exploration and production commercial aviation semiconductor and communications markets funding continuation and award of government programs cuts to defense spending resulting from future deficit reduction measures including potential automatic cuts to defense spending that have been triggered by the budget control act of 2011 and risks associated with the integration of dalsa increasing fuel costs could negatively affect the markets of our commercial aviation businesses lower oil and natural gas prices as well as instability in the middle east or other oil producing regions could negatively affect our businesses that supply the oil and gas industry in addition financial market fluctuations affect the value of our pension assets 

global responses to terrorism and other perceived threats increase uncertainties associated with forwardlooking statements about our businesses various responses to terrorism and perceived threats could realign government programs and affect the composition funding or timing of our programs changes in the policies of us and foreign governments could result over time in reductions and realignment in defense or other government spending and further changes in programs in which the company participates including anticipated reductions in the company’s missile defense engineering services and nasa programs 

while teledyne’s growth strategy includes possible acquisitions we cannot provide any assurance as to when if or on what terms any acquisitions will be made acquisitions involve various inherent risks such as among others our ability to integrate acquired businesses retain customers and achieve identified financial and operating synergies there are additional risks associated with acquiring owning and operating businesses outside of the united states including those arising from us and foreign government policy changes or actions and exchange rate fluctuations 

the company continues to take action to assure compliance with the internal controls disclosure controls and other requirements of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 while we believe our control systems are effective there are inherent limitations in all control systems and misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and may not be detected 

additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in the forwardlooking statements is contained beginning on page 13 of this form 10k under the caption “risk factors cautionary statement as to forwardlooking statements” forwardlooking statements are generally accompanied by words such as “estimate” “project” “predict” “believes” or “expect” that convey the uncertainty of future events or outcomes we assume no obligation to publicly update or revise any forwardlooking statements whether as a result of new information or otherwise

principally through teledyne continental motors inc we design develop and manufacture piston engines ignition systems and aftermarket engines and spare parts for general aviation airframe manufacturers and the aftermarket we are one of two primary worldwide original equipment producers of piston aircraft engines for the general aviation marketplace 

 

 11 

 

customers 

 

we have hundreds of customers in the electronics instrumentation digital imaging communications and aerospace and defense electronics industries no commercial customer accounted for more than 10 of our total sales during 2010 2009 or 2008 

 

approximately 44 47 and 44 of our total sales for 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively were derived from contracts with agencies of and prime contractors to the us government our principal us government customer is the us department of defense these sales represented 34 36 and 32 of our total sales for 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively in 2010 2009 and 2008 our largest program with the us government was the systems engineering and technical assistance contract with the space and missile defense command and it represented 34 41 and 38 of total sales respectively information on the company’s sales to the us government including direct sales as a prime contractor and indirect sales as a subcontractor are as follows in millions 

 

 

 

as described on pages 20 through 23 there are risks associated with doing business with the us government in 2010 approximately 54 of our us government prime contracts and subcontracts were fixedprice type contracts compared to 50 in 2009 and 48 in 2008 under these types of contracts we bear the inherent risk that actual performance cost may exceed the fixed contract price such contracts are typically not subject to renegotiation of profits if we fail to anticipate technical problems estimate costs accurately or control costs during performance additionally us government contracts are subject to termination by the us government at its convenience without identification of any default when contracts are terminated for convenience we typically recover costs incurred or committed settlement expenses and profit on work completed prior to termination we had two us government contracts terminated for convenience in 2010 compared to seven in 2009 and five in 2008 

 

our total backlog of confirmed orders was approximately 8638 million at january 2 2011 8125 million at january 3 2010 and 8225 million at december 28 2008 we expect to fulfill 98 of such backlog of confirmed orders during 2011 

 

sales to international customers accounted for approximately 29 of total sales in 2010 compared with 26 in 2009 and 24 in 2008 in 2009 we sold products to customers in over 100 foreign countries approximately 90 percent of our sales to foreign customers were made to customers in 28 foreign countries the 2010 top five countries for international sales which included the united kingdom norway germany china and canada constituted approximately 159 of our total sales 

 

raw materials and suppliers 

 

generally our businesses have experienced minimal fluctuations in the supply of raw materials but not without some price volatility while some of our businesses provide services for those businesses that sell hardware and product a portion of the value that we provide is labor oriented such as design engineering assembly and test activities in manufacturing our products we use our own production capabilities and also third party suppliers and subcontractors including international sources some of the items we purchase for the manufacture of our products including certain gyro components for some marine navigation applications certain magnets and helix wire for our traveling wave tubes and certain infrared detectors substrates are purchased from limited or single sources including international sources due to technical capability price and other factors while over the years we have not experienced much difficulty in procuring raw materials components subassemblies and other supplies required in our manufacturing processes continuing disruption 

in the global economy and financial markets could trigger increased pricing and otherwise affect our suppliers as well as our ability to procure some supplies 

 

sales and marketing 

 

our sales and marketing approach varies by segment and by products within our segments a shared fundamental tenet is the commitment to work closely with our customers to understand their needs with an aim to secure preferred supplier and longerterm relationships 

 

our segments use a combination of internal sales forces distributors and commissioned sales representatives to market and sell our products and services as part of ongoing acquisition integration efforts some of our teledyne instruments companies and other businesses have been working to consolidate or share internal sales and servicing efforts several teledyne businesses have begun marketing and selling products collaboratively to similar customers to promote “onestop” shopping under singular “brand” names including teledyne oil  gas teledyne marine teledyne nuclear and teledyne water quality 

 

products are also advertised in appropriate trade journals and by means of various websites to promote our products and other capabilities our personnel regularly participate in relevant trade shows and professional associations 

 

many of our government contracts are awarded after a competitive bidding process in which we seek to emphasize our ability to provide superior products and technical solutions in addition to competitive pricing 

 

through teledyne technologies international corp and other subsidiaries the company has established offices in foreign countries to facilitate international sales for various businesses 

 

competition 

 

we believe that technological capabilities and innovation and the ability to invest in the development of new and enhanced products are critical to obtaining and maintaining leadership in our markets and the industries in which we compete although we have certain advantages that we believe help us compete effectively in our markets each of our markets is highly competitive our businesses vigorously compete on the basis of quality product performance and reliability technical expertise price and service many of our competitors have and potential competitors could have greater name recognition a larger installed base of products more extensive engineering manufacturing marketing and distribution capabilities and greater financial technological and personnel resources than we do 

 

research and development 

 

our research and development efforts primarily involve engineering and design related to improving products and developing new products and technologies in the same or similar fields we spent a total of 3199 million in 2010 3748 million in 2009 and 3917 million in 2008 on research and development and bid and proposal costs customerfunded research and development most of which was attributable to work under contracts with the us government represented approximately 81 of total research and development costs for 2010 compared with 84 and 84 in 2009 and 2008 respectively 

 

in 2010 we incurred 613 million in companyfunded research and development and bid and proposal costs we expect the level of companyfunded research and development and bid and proposal costs to be approximately 999 million in 2011 

 

intellectual property 

 

while we own and control various intellectual property rights including patents trade secrets confidential information trademarks trade names and copyrights which in the aggregate are of material importance to our business we believe that our business as a whole is not materially dependent upon any one intellectual property or related group of such properties we own several hundred active patents and are licensed to use certain patents technology and other intellectual property rights owned and controlled by others similarly 

other companies are licensed to use certain patents technology and other intellectual property rights owned and controlled by us 

 

patents patent applications and license agreements will expire or terminate over time by operation of law in accordance with their terms or otherwise we do not expect the expiration or termination of these patents patent applications and license agreements to have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

 

employees 

 

overall we consider our relations with our employees to be good our total current workforce consists of approximately 9200 employees this number includes approximately 1000 employees added in connection with our dalsa acquisition and approximately 400 employees who are part of our discontinued operations 

 

the international union of united automobile aerospace and agricultural implement workers of america represents approximately 250 active employees at our teledyne continental motors piston engines manufacturing facility in mobile alabama part of discontinued operations under a collective bargaining agreement that expires by its terms on march 20 2013 this union also represents approximately 10 active employees at the teledyne turbine engines facility in toledo ohio under a collective bargaining agreement that expires on november 8 2014 if the sale of our general aviation piston engines businesses occurs the mobile alabama collective bargaining agreement will be included with the sale 

 

executive management 

 

teledyne’s executive management includes 

 

 14 

 

 

  

dr mehrabian and teledyne have entered into a fourth amended and restated employment agreement dated as of january 21 2009 under the agreement we will employ dr mehrabian as the chairman president and chief executive officer through at least december 31 2012 because 12 months notice of nonrenewal had not been given prior to the expiration of the term ended december 31 2010 the agreement automatically renews for a successive one year unless either party gives the other written notice of its election not to renew at least 12 months before the expiration of the current term or any successive renewal terms if notice is given dr mehrabian would then retire on december 31st of the year following the 12th month after receipt of the notice under the agreement dr mehrabian’s annual base salary is 861000 the agreement provides that dr mehrabian is entitled to participate in teledyne’s annual incentive bonus plan “aip” and other executive compensation and benefit programs the agreement provides dr mehrabian with a nonqualified pension arrangement under which teledyne will pay him annually starting six months following his retirement and for a period of 10 years as payments supplemental to any accrued pension under our qualified pension plan an amount equal to 50 of his base compensation as in effect at retirement 

 

sixteen current members of management have entered into change of control severance agreements the agreements have a threeyear automatically renewing term except as noted below the executive is entitled to severance benefits if 1 there is a change in control of the company and 2 within three months before or 24 months after the change in control either we terminate the executive’s employment for reasons other than cause or the executive terminates the employment for good reason “severance benefits” currently consist of 

 

 16 

 

  

the agreements were amended as of december 31 2008 to defer certain payments for six months following a separation of service to assure compliance with section 409a of the internal revenue code 

 

on or before february 25 2011 dr mehrabian mr pichelli mr geveden and eight other executives voluntarily agreed to amend and restate their agreements to conform the agreements to prevailing best practices as compared to the prior agreements as reflected above the amended and restated change in control severance agreements contain four key changes or reductions as follows 

 

  

on january 31 2011 teledyne also provided notice to messrs kuelbs and schnittjer and three other executives who did not agree to sign the amended and restated change in control agreement that it would not extend the term of their agreements which action results in the termination of their existing change in control severance agreement three years from the date of such notice january 31 2014 

 

effective april 22 2009 the company entered into individual indemnification agreements with directors and certain officers and executives of teledyne including those then members of executive management listed above a total of 25 persons have such agreements simply the indemnification agreements provide the directors and executives who are parties to the agreements with a standalone contractual right to indemnification and expense advancement to the greatest extent allowable under delaware law some further details include 

 

 17 

  

  

  

  

our indemnification obligations do not cover the following situations 

 

  

under the indemnification agreements in the event of a change in control or we reduce or do not renew our director’s  officer’s insurance coverage we are required to purchase or cause the acquirer or successor to the company to purchase or maintain a sixyear tail policy subject to a 200 premium cap the agreements continue until the later of i 10 years after the indemnitee ceases to serve as a director or officer and ii one year following the final termination of any proceeding subject to the agreement

 item 1 a risk factors tableend  

risk factors cautionary statement as to forwardlooking statements 

 

the following text highlights various risks and uncertainties associated with teledyne these factors could materially affect “forwardlooking statements” within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 that we may from time to time make including forwardlooking statements contained in “item 1 business” and “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” of this form 10k and in teledyne’s 2010 annual report to stockholders it is not possible for management to predict all such factors and new factors may emerge additionally management cannot assess 

the impact of each such factor on teledyne or the extent to which any factor or combination of factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forwardlooking statements while teledyne has classified its general aviation piston engines businesses as “discontinued operations” until such divestiture is completed for the purposes of this section teledyne continues to identify the risk factors associated with such discontinued operations as the divestiture is subject to closing conditions there remains a risk that such disposition will not occur or will not occur on the terms previously agreed 

 

with the recently completed acquisition of dalsa corporation and upon completion of the pending divestiture of teledyne’s piston engines businesses the risk profile of teledyne will differ and may differ materially from prior years which could materially change teledyne’s results of operations 

 

on february 12 2011 teledyne completed its largest acquisition to date when it acquired dalsa corporation for approximately cad 337 million taking into account dalsa’s stock options and net cash as of december 31 2010 dalsa headquartered in waterloo ontario canada with key operations in canada as well as the netherlands and japan designs develops manufactures and markets digital imaging products and semiconductors teledyne funded the acquisition by borrowing under its bank credit facility and with cash on hand dalsa’s revenues totaled cad 2123 million for 2010 as discussed on pages 24 to 27 while there are risks associated with acquisitions generally including integration risks there are additional risks associated with owning and operating businesses internationally including those arising from us and foreign policy changes and exchange rate fluctuations in 2011 with this acquisition a greater percentage of teledyne’s revenues and expenses will arise from international sources in addition like other teledyne businesses continued innovation and research and development efforts will be required to maintain teledyne dalsa’s leadership position in digital imaging products and semiconductor production teledyne dalsa’s business also may be more capital intensive than other teledyne businesses increasing teledyne’s capital requirements further teledyne dalsa currently relies on a number of singlepoint of failure pieces of manufacturing equipment or processes within its semiconductor business while it may monitor such equipment and processes including where appropriate maintain redundant equipment spare components or service agreements with equipment manufacturers a catastrophic failure of such equipment or processes could have a material adverse impact on its business 

 

additionally teledyne continues to work to close in the first quarter of 2011 the previously announced divestiture of its general aviation piston engines businesses to technify motor usa ltd a subsidiary of chinabased avic international holding corporation for 1860 million in cash these piston engines businesses comprise teledyne’s discontinued operations formerly teledyne’s aerospace engines and components segment and had 1337 million in revenues in 2010 as discussed on pages 27 to 29 there are risks particular to these businesses that have historically been greater than those faced by other teledyne businesses such as those associated with product liability claims product recalls and insurance coverages the general economic downturn and the lack of availability of credit have tended to adversely impact sales of general aviation aircraft more than sales in some other markets in which we participate when teledyne no longer owns these piston engines businesses such risks should be reduced 

 

with the recently completed acquisition of dalsa and upon completion of the pending divestiture of teledyne’s piston engines businesses teledyne will be transformed into an electronics instrumentation digital imaging and engineering focused company accordingly the risk profile of teledyne will change and may differ materially from prior years among other things as highlighted above teledyne will face more international and business risks and it will no longer face the risks associated with being a manufacturer and seller of general aviation engines and related components a larger percentage of teledyne’s sales will be to commercial customers as opposed to the us government 

 

we sell products and services to customers in industries that are cyclical and sensitive to changes in general economic activity 

 

we develop and manufacture products for customers in the energy exploration and production markets each of which has been cyclical and suffered from fluctuating market demands strong demand and increased prices for oil and natural gas historically has contributed to substantial revenue growth at teledyne geophysical instruments teledyne odi and our other marine businesses a cyclical downturn in these markets 

may materially affect future operating results particularly given our broader range of marine instrumentation businesses acquired since 2003 

 

domestic and international commercial aerospace markets are cyclical in nature historic demand for new commercial aircraft has been related to the stability and health of domestic and international economies if economic conditions do not improve and the credit markets further tighten it may continue to be difficult for the commercial airlines and aircraft leasing companies to obtain credit to buy new airplanes delays or changes in aircraft and component orders could impact the future demand for our teledyne controls and other products and have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

 

many of the oem customers of our discontinued operations are privatelyheld and may not be wellcapitalized over the last several years a few aircraft manufacturing customers of teledyne continental motors have filed for bankruptcy protection while teledyne continental motors tries to monitor its customers’ payment streams and financial wherewithal and avail itself of available prebankruptcy protections among other things such actions may only mitigate losses not prevent them any future credit problems with our customers could result in writeoffs or reimbursements of purported preferential payments and could have a material adverse effect on the business results of operations and financial condition of our discontinued operations 

 

some of our businesses including newly acquired teledyne dalsa are also suppliers to the semiconductor industry which is highly cyclical by nature the semiconductor industry has experienced significant and sometimes prolonged downturns any downturn in the semiconductor industry or any other industry that uses a significant number of semiconductor devices such as consumer electronic products telecommunication devices or computing devices could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results 

 

in addition we sell products and services to customers in industries that are sensitive to the level of general economic activity and consumer spending habits and in more mature industries that are sensitive to capacity adverse economic conditions affecting these industries may reduce demand for our products and services which may reduce our profits or our production levels or both some of our businesses serve industries such as power generation and petrochemical refining which may be negatively impacted by reductions in global capital expenditures and manufacturing capacity 

 

changes in demand in the industries in which we do business also can result in the inventory we carry becoming excess or obsolete further teledyne dalsa relies on a small number of customers in its semiconductor business given this lack of diversity small fluctuations and inventory corrections at the end customer level could negatively impact this acquired company’s operating results as well as that of the digital imaging segment 

 

our dependence on revenue from government contracts subjects us to many risks 

 

our revenue from government contracts depends on the continued availability of funding from the us government and accordingly we have the risk that funding for our existing contracts may be canceled or diverted to other uses or delayed 

 

we perform work on a number of contracts with the department of defense and other agencies and departments of the us government including subcontracts with government prime contractors sales under contracts with the us government as a whole including sales under contracts with the department of defense as prime contractor or subcontractor represented approximately 44 of our total revenue in 2010 as compared with 47 in 2009 and 44 in 2008 performance under government contracts has certain inherent risks that could have a material effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

 

government contracts are conditioned upon the continuing availability of congressional appropriations congress typically appropriates funds for a given program on a fiscalyear basis even though contract performance may take more than one year as a result at the beginning of a major program a contract is typically only partially funded and additional funding is normally committed to the contract by the procuring agency only as congress makes appropriations available for future fiscal years the timing of program cycles can also affect our results of operations for a particular quarter or year it is not uncommon for the department 

of defense to delay the timing of awards for major programs for six to twelve months or more beyond the original projected timeframe 

 

the failure by congress to approve budgets on a timely basis could delay procurement of our services and products and cause us to lose future revenues in years when congress is not able to complete its budget process before the end of the us government’s fiscal year on september 30 congress typically funds government operations pursuant to a continuing resolution when the us government operates under a continuing resolution it may delay funding we expect to receive from customers on work we are already performing and will likely result in new initiatives being delayed or in some cases cancelled the us government’s failure to complete its budget process or to fund government operations pursuant to a continuing resolution may result in a us government shutdown which could result in a material loss of revenues for us 

 

us defense spending is expected to continue to moderate and then decline in some areas over the next few years an emphasis on federal deficit and debt reduction could lead to a decrease in overall defense spending the continued war on terrorism and the iraq and afghanistan wars also could result in a diversion of funds from programs in which teledyne participates in addition continued defense spending does not necessarily correlate to continued business for us because not all of the programs in which we participate or have current capabilities may be provided with continued funding 

 

changes in policy and budget priorities by the president his administration and our congress for various defense and nasa programs could continue to impact our engineered systems and aerospace and defense electronics segments for example changes in national space policy that affect nasa’s budget are likely there have already been significant reductions in missile defense budgets and we anticipate continuing scrutiny of those budgets to impact our revenues our engineered systems segment may be further impacted by delays in production funding on the joint air to surface standoff missile “jassm” program in addition reductions and delays in research and development funding by the us government may continue to impact our revenues as the defense advanced research projects agency referred to as darpa reviews its programs aimed to enhance technologically us military capabilities and national security changes to the darpa research and technology development programs in which we participate could occur finally various department of defense initiatives such as the emphasis on insourcing positions to the government and the planned closure of the joint forces command could negatively impact our engineered systems segment 

 

our aerospace and defense electronics segment provides a variety of products for several military platforms including the f35 joint strike fighter teledyne cml group limited part of our engineered systems segment also provided products for this aircraft development and production of this aircraft is very expensive and there is no guarantee that the department of defense as it balances budget priorities will continue to provide funding to manufacture and support the f35 aircraft or other platforms for which we provide products in 2010 delays in the f35 program were announced in 2009 congress had made the decision to curtail f22a aircraft funding reallocation of funding priorities within the department of defense could also affect repair and spares sales for older military platforms including by way of example sales of our traveling wave tubes for f15 f16 f18 ea6b b52 b1 c130 and u2 aircraft 

 

our participation in government programs may decrease or be subject to renegotiation as those programs evolve over time 

 

the relocation to huntsville alabama of the missile defense agency or mda has resulted in the transfer to the mda of certain missions and functions from the us army space and missile defense command or smdc new leadership at the mda is conducting solicitations that could impact support by our engineered systems segment to the agency for example all mda government engineering support services work is now to be recompeted at the conclusion of each existing contract and several major prime contracts under which we perform such services are nearing the end of their respective periods of performance 

 

the us government has also placed emphasis on organizational conflict of interest or oci as a result requests for proposals in the areas of engineering support testing and operational analysis are restricting bidders from related development and integration work this may require some businesses or subsidiaries of 

teledyne to abstain or withdraw from contract competition if other teledyne businesses may be affected by an oci in particular the mda is reconsidering its policy on oci it is reviewing all oci mitigation plans and may require more rigid mitigatory conditions going forward potentially limiting our participation in certain major mda programs such as groundbased midcourse defense 

 

the us government has been placing emphasis on small business quotas and increasing small business contract set asides and minimum work percentages in some cases prime contractors are required to reduce large subcontractor participation in order to fill small business quotas and be responsive to proposals and bids additionally the general accounting office or gao has issued rulings which favor the interests of small businesses under multiple award indefinite deliveryindefinite quantity or idiq contracts several of the contracts under which we perform engineering support services for mda are of this type and as a result our engineering services business could be significantly impacted 

 

over time and for a variety of reasons programs can evolve and affect the extent of our participation for example teledyne brown engineering inc’s groundbased midcourse defense “gmd” program has been negatively impacted by both the nominal end date of development activity and the change in focus of the current administration relative to missile defense teledyne brown engineering’s revenues for the gmd program declined from approximately 43 million in 2008 to 31 million in 2009 to 14 million in 2010 although mda plans to award a deployment and sustainment contract for gmd we expect that teledyne brown engineering’s revenues under this activity will continue to decline in 2011 this reduction is due to a number of factors including the completion of the current deployment cycle the change in mda focus toward a phased regional deployment defense architecture continued federal government personnel insourcing and increased small business participation requirements in department of defense contracts 

 

we have been a significant participant in nasa programs primarily through our engineered systems segment and through teledyne scientific company our current nasa activities focus on the james webb space telescope payload operation and integration on the international space station iss and concept development engineering services and integration for new nasa launch vehicles during 2010 the president introduced significant changes to the national space policy the president and congress continue to discuss nasa’s future direction although the outcome of these discussions remains uncertain current plans include the cancellation of nasa’s constellation program which includes ares launch vehicles utilization of commercial launch vehicles for crew and cargo iss expeditions and development of a nasa heavy lift launch vehicle for space exploration as a result of these changes we will attempt to transition our business to meet the needs of the new policy and programs however failure to transition our business successfully could result in reduced sales in addition delayed decisions and funding for nasa’s new space policy could negatively impact our business 

 

we may not be successful in bidding for future contracts which would reduce our revenues or slow our growth 

 

we obtain many us government prime contracts and subcontracts through the process of competitive bidding we may not be successful in having our bids awarded in addition we may spend substantial amounts of time money and effort including design development and marketing activities required to prepare bids and proposals for contracts that may not be awarded to us in 2010 we incurred 143 million on bid and proposals costs compared with 137 million in 2009 and 137 million in 2008 

 

our contracts with the us government are subject to termination rights that could adversely affect us 

 

most of our us government contracts are subject to termination by the us government either at its convenience or upon the default of the contractor even when not expressly included in a us government contract courts have validated termination for convenience as a matter of public procurement policy termination for convenience provisions provide only for the recovery of costs incurred or committed settlement expenses and profit on work completed prior to termination termination for default clauses impose liability on the contractor for excess costs incurred by the us government in reprocuring undelivered items 

from another source during 2010 teledyne had two us government contracts terminated for convenience one of which was in our aerospace and defense electronics segment and one of which was in our engineered systems segment we did not have any of our us government contracts terminated for default during 2010 

 

we may lose money or generate less than expected profits on our fixedprice government contracts and we may lose money if we fail to meet certain prespecified targets in government contracts 

 

there is no guarantee that us government contracts will be profitable a number of our us government prime contracts and subcontracts are fixedprice type contracts 54 of our total us government contracts in 2010 50 in 2009 and 48 in 2008 under these types of contracts we bear the inherent risk that actual performance cost may exceed the fixed contract price this is particularly true when the contract is awarded and the price finalized in advance of final completion of design under such contracts we must absorb cost overruns notwithstanding the difficulty of estimating all of the costs we will incur in performing these contracts our failure to anticipate technical problems estimate costs accurately or control costs during performance of a fixedprice contract may reduce profitability or cause a loss we have also experienced some volatility in the pricing of certain raw materials and components underlying our fixedprice contracts such contracts are typically not subject to renegotiation of profits if we fail to anticipate technical problems estimate costs accurately or control costs during performance we cannot assure that our contract loss provisions in our financial statements will be adequate to cover all actual future losses we may lose money on some contracts if we fail to meet these estimates 

 

certain fees under some of our us government contracts are linked to meeting specified technical cost andor schedule targets including development or testing deadlines fees may also be influenced or be dependent on the collective efforts and success of other defense contractors over which we had no or limited control 

 

our business is subject to government contracting regulations and our failure to comply with such laws and regulations could harm our operating results and prospects 

 

we like other government contractors are subject to various audits reviews and investigations including private party “whistleblower” lawsuits relating to our compliance with federal and state laws generally claims arising out of these us government inquiries and voluntary disclosures can be resolved without resorting to litigation however should the business or division involved be charged with wrongdoing or should the us government determine that the business or division is not a “presently responsible contractor” that business or division and conceivably our company as a whole could be temporarily suspended or in the event of a conviction could be debarred for up to three years from receiving new government contracts or governmentapproved subcontracts in addition we could expend substantial amounts defending against such charges and in damages fines and penalties if such charges were proven or were to result in negotiated settlements 

 

united states and global responses to terrorism the iraq and afghanistan wars the mass protests and turmoil in middle eastern countries mexican border town violence nuclear proliferation concerns and potential epidemics increase uncertainties with respect to many of our businesses and may adversely affect our business and results of operations 

 

united states’ and global responses to terrorism the iraq and afghanistan wars the mass protests and turmoil in middle eastern countries mexican border town violence and nuclear proliferation concerns increase uncertainties with respect to us and other business and financial markets several factors associated directly or indirectly with terrorism the iraq afghanistan egypt and middle east situations and perceived nuclear threats and responses may adversely affect us the reaction to iran’s continuing desire to explore nuclear capabilities could adversely affect oil prices and some of our businesses the reaction to egypt permitting iran to sent warships through the suez canal could adversely affect some of our businesses 

 

while some of our businesses that provide products or services to the us government experienced greater demand as a result of increased us government defense spending various responses could realign 

government programs and affect the composition funding or timing of our government programs the president his administration and congress could also further alter government programs government spending could shift to the department of defense or homeland security programs in which we may not participate or may not have current capabilities these decisions could curtail less pressing nondefense programs in which we do participate including department of energy or nasa programs government spending could also shift towards nondefense programs in which we do not currently participate 

 

air travel declines have occurred after terrorist attacks and heightened security alerts as well as after the h1n1 virus sars and bird flu scares additional declines in air travel resulting from such factors and other factors could adversely affect the financial condition of many of our commercial airline and aircraft manufacturer customers and in turn could adversely affect our aerospace and defense electronics segment in addition a prolonged virus epidemic or pandemic or the threat thereof could result in worker absences lower productivity voluntary closure of our offices and manufacturing facilities disruptions in our supply chain travel restrictions on our employees and other disruptions to our businesses moreover health epidemics may force local health and government authorities to mandate the temporary closure of our offices and manufacturing facilities as was done with our mexico operations in 2009 

 

deterioration of financial performance of airlines could result in a reduction of discretionary spending for upgrades of avionics and inflight communications equipment which would adversely affect our aerospace and defense electronics segment 

 

the us government continues to evaluate potential security issues associated with general aviation increased government regulations including but not limited to increased airspace regulations including user fees could lead to an overall decline in air travel and have an adverse affect on our aerospace and defense electronics segment as well as our discontinued operations as happened after the september 11th terrorist attacks reinstatement of flight restrictions would negatively impact the market for general aviation aircraft piston engines and components of our discontinued operations and associated products of teledyne battery products potential reductions in the need for general aviation aircraft maintenance as a result of declines in air travel could also adversely affect our discontinued operations 

 

higher oil prices could adversely affect commercial airlinerelated customers of our aerospace and defense electronics segment higher oil prices could also reduce general aviation air travel negatively affecting our discontinued operations conversely lower oil prices could decrease oil exploration and petrochemical refining activities and hinder our marine and other instrumentation businesses including teledyne geophysical instruments teledyne tss limited teledyne benthos inc teledyne dg o’brien and teledyne odi inc as well as some of our other businesses such as teledyne storm products inc in addition instability in the middle east or other oilproducing regions could adversely affect expansion plans of the oil and gas industry customers of our instrumentation and cable solutions businesses 

 

violence and crime in mexico particularly in border towns where we conduct some manufacturing activities could adversely affect our relays and cable solutions businesses 

 

acquisitions involve inherent risks that may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

 

our growth strategy includes acquisitions acquisitions involve various inherent risks such as 

 

 24 

 

  

while we conduct financial and other due diligence in connection with our acquisitions and generally seek some form of protection including indemnification from a seller and sometimes an escrow of a portion of the purchase price to cover potential issues such acquired companies may have weaknesses or liabilities that are not accurately assessed or brought to our attention at the time of the acquisition further indemnities or escrows may not fully cover such matters particularly matters identified after a closing 

 

we have also acquired several private companies including the 2010 acquisitions of optimum optical systems inc and hafmynd ehf now known as teledyne gavia ehf private companies generally do not have as formal or comprehensive internal controls and compliance systems in place as public companies while we have required various sellers to take certain compliance actions prior to the closing of an acquisition including making voluntary disclosures under various export control laws and regulations and have sought protections in the purchase agreement for such matters there is no assurance that we have identified all issues or will be fully protected from historic liabilities after acquiring a company notwithstanding preclosing due diligence we have discovered issues that required further action including making voluntary disclosures under various defense and export control laws and regulations 

 

while the products and customer base of the companies we have acquired over the years are complementary to some of teledyne’s existing businesses there is no assurance that we will achieve all identified financial operating and marketing synergies we may also experience problems that arise in entering new markets through acquisitions in which we may have little or no experience 

 

in 2011 we expanded our international presence with the acquisition of dalsa which has operations in canada the netherlands japan china and germany as well as the united states additionally in 2010 we expanded our united kingdom presence with the acquisition of intelek plc our united kingdom operations accounted for approximately 5 of total revenues in both 2010 and 2009 compared with 4 in 2008 there are additional risks associated with owning and operating businesses internationally including those arising from us and foreign government policy changes or actions and exchange rate fluctuations further it has been postulated that the united kingdom economy may be recovering more slowly from the 2008 global economic crisis than the economies in the united states and mainland europe 

 

in connection with acquisitions we may consolidate one or more acquired facilities with other teledyne facilities to obtain synergies and costsavings for example in 2009 we consolidated the 2008acquired moorpark cabased operations and assets of demo systems llc principally with teledyne controls el segundo ca we also combined and relocated with minimal disruption the operations of the 2008acquired teledyne impulse and longtime owned teledyne interconnect devices to a new leased facility in san diego ca in addition in 2009 we relocated the principal operations of both 2008acquired teledyne tss limited and teledyne cormon limited to more modern and larger facilities close to their prior locations nonetheless despite planning relocation and consolidation of manufacturing operations has inherent risks as it tends to involve among other things change of personnel application of a new business system software and learning or adaptation of manufacturing processes and techniques as a result production delays at a new operating location may occur 

 

under sec rules teledyne must issue a report on management’s assessment of the effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting the sec permits a limited timebased exclusion for acquisitions to give a company an opportunity to evaluate more fully the internal controls of acquired companies and correct deficiencies and institute new or additional internal controls our 2010 management’s report specifically excludes from its scope and coverage our 2010 acquisitions of intelek plc optimum optical systems inc and hafmynd ehf allowing us additional time to evaluate existing internal controls and implement additional controls as appropriate with regard to future acquisitions we can provide no assurance that we will be able to provide a report that contains no significant deficiencies or material weaknesses with respect to these acquired companies or other acquisitions 

in connection with our acquisitions including ones which we do not complete we may incur significant transaction costs we are required to expense as incurred such transaction costs which may have an adverse impact on our quarterly financial results 

 

we are subject to the risks associated with international sales which could harm our business or results of operations 

 

during 2010 sales to international customers accounted for approximately 29 of our total revenues as compared to 26 in 2009 and 24 in 2008 we anticipate that future sales to international customers will continue to account for a significant and increasing percentage of our revenues particularly since business and growth plans for many teledyne businesses focus on sales outside of the united states including to emerging markets such as china and brazil the dalsa acquisition will also contribute to greater international sales risks associated with these sales include 

 

  

any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition exchange rate fluctuations may negatively affect the cost of our products to international customers and therefore reduce our competitive position if the us dollar strengthens against the british pound sterling or euro our european customers may no longer find our product prices more attractive than european competitors with the acquisition of canadianbased dalsa increases in the value of the canadian dollar relative to the us dollar or other foreign currencies could adversely affect the business operations and the financial condition of our digital imaging segment 

 

sales of our products and services internationally are subject to us and local government regulations and procurement policies and practices including regulations relating to importexport control violations of export control rules could result in suspension of our ability to export items from one or more businesses or the entire corporation depending on the scope of the suspension this could have a material effect on our ability to perform certain international contracts concerns over theft of technology for military uses nuclear proliferation concerns terrorism diversion and other factors have resulted in increased export scrutiny of international sales including some of our marine instruments digital imaging and other products to international customers there has also been increasing export oversight and regulation of sales to china travel restrictions to middle eastern african and other countries may negatively affect continuing international sales or service revenues from such regions there are also us and international regulations relating to investments exchange controls and repatriation of earnings as well as varying currency political and economic risks 

 

among other things we are subject to the us foreign corrupt practices act or fcpa which generally prohibits us companies and their intermediaries from bribing foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or keeping business or otherwise obtaining favorable treatment in particular while we have procedures in place and conduct fcpa training we may be held liable for actions taken by our strategic or local partners even though our partners are not subject to the fcpa further the united kingdom recently adopted but delayed 

implementation of the uk bribery act which raises the bar for antibribery law enforcement and compliance relative to the fcpa any determination that we had violated the fcpa the uk bribery act when implemented or equivalent antibribery and corruption laws in countries in which we do business could result in sanctions that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

our indebtedness could materially and adversely affect our business 

 

as of january 2 2011 we had 2500 million in total outstanding indebtedness which included 2500 million in senior unsecured notes issued and sold in a private placement transaction in september 2010 and no amounts under our prior 5900 million credit facility on february 25 2011 we refinanced our prior 5900 million credit facility that was set to expire in july 2011 and had 2730 million outstanding under our new 5500 million credit facility which does not terminate until february 25 2016 our indebtedness could harm our business by among other things reducing the funds available to make new strategic acquisitions our indebtedness could also have a material adverse effect on our business by increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions or a downturn in our business general adverse economic and industry conditions or a downturn in our business could result in our inability to repay this indebtedness in a timely manner also borrowing rates are higher under our new 5500 million credit facility due to changes in market conditions since our last credit facility was put in place in 2006 a 100 basis point increase in interest rates results in an annual interest expense of approximately 27 million assuming the 2730 million in floating rate debt were outstanding for the full year we may also elect to raise other forms of debt capital depending on financial market and economic conditions 

 

product liability claims product recalls and field service actions could have a material adverse effect on our reputation business results of operations and financial condition 

 

as a manufacturer and distributor of a wide variety of products including aircraft engines which is part of our discontinued operations and subject to divestiture monitoring instruments and medical devices our results of operations are susceptible to adverse publicity regarding the quality or safety of our products in part product liability claims challenging the safety of our products may result in a decline in sales for a particular product which could adversely affect our results of operations this could be the case even if the claims themselves are proven untrue or settled for immaterial amounts 

 

while we have general liability and other insurance policies concerning product liabilities we have selfinsured retentions or deductibles under such policies with respect to a portion of these liabilities for example our current annual selfinsured retention for general aviation aircraft liabilities incurred in connection with products manufactured by teledyne continental motors inc now part of discontinued operations and subject to divestiture is approximately 50 million a decrease from 172 million for the prior annual period our existing aircraft product liability insurance policy expires on may 31 2011 additionally based on facts and circumstances of claims we have not always accrued amounts up to the applicable annual selfinsured retentions awarded damages could be more than our accruals we could incur losses above the aggregate annual policy limit as well 

 

product recalls can be expensive and tarnish our reputation and have a material adverse effect on the sales of our products in 2009 our discontinued operations commenced two product recalls for which pretax charges aggregating 208 million had been recorded to cover estimated costs associated with the recall and replacement of the affected cylinders and lifters 

 

we have been joined among a number of defendants often over 100 in lawsuits alleging injury or death as a result of exposure to asbestos we have not incurred material liabilities in connection with these lawsuits the filings typically do not identify any of our products as a source of asbestos exposure and we have been dismissed from cases for lack of product identification but only after some defense costs have been incurred also because of the prominent “teledyne” name we may be mistakenly joined in lawsuits involving a company or business that was not assumed by us as part of our 1999 spinoff our historic insurance coverage including that of its predecessors may not fully cover such claims and the defense of such matters coverage 

typically depends on the year of purported exposure and other factors nonetheless we intend to defend these claims vigorously congress from time to time has considered tort reform to deal with asbestosrelated claims but to date nothing has materialized 

 

certain gas generators historically manufactured by teledyne energy systems inc contained a sealed wetted asbestos component while the company has transitioned to a replacement material had placed warning labels on its products and took care in handling of this discontinued material by employees there is no assurance that the company will not face product liability or workers compensation claims involving this component 

 

our teledyne brown engineering’s laboratory in knoxville tennessee performs radiological analyses while the laboratory is certified by the department of energy and the nuclear procurement issues committee also known as nupic and has other nuclearrelated certifications and internal quality controls in place errors and omissions in analyses may occur we currently have errors and omissions insurance coverage and nuclear liability insurance coverage that might apply depending on the circumstances we also have sought indemnities from some of our customers our insurance coverage or indemnities however may not be adequate to cover potential problems associated with faulty radiological analyses 

 

teledyne brown engineering inc and other teledyne companies manufacture components for customers in the nuclear power market including utilities and certain governmental entities the components include for example penetration assemblies waste storage canisters and process equipment certain liabilities associated with such products are covered by the price anderson act and other statutory and common law defenses and we have received indemnities from some of our customers however there is no assurance we will not face product liability claims related to such products 

 

we cannot assure that we will not have additional product liability claims or that we will not recall any additional products 

 

we may have difficulty obtaining product liability and other insurance coverages or be subject to increased costs for such coverage 

 

as a manufacturer of a variety of products including aircraft engines used in general aviation aircraft now part of our discontinued operations and subject to divestiture we have general liability and other insurance policies that provide coverage beyond selfinsured retentions or deductibles we cannot assure that for 2011 and in future years insurance carriers will be willing to renew coverage or provide new coverage for product liability especially as it relates to general aviation over the last several years the number of insurance companies providing general aviation product liability insurance coverage has decreased even if such insurance is available we may be required to pay substantially higher prices for coverage andor increase our levels of selfinsured retentions or reserves our current aircraft product liability insurance policy expires on may 31 2011 and has an annual selfinsured retention of approximately 50 million 

 

to offset aircraft product liability insurance costs we continue to work to reduce manufacturing and other costs and also to pass on such insurance costs through price increases on our aircraft engines and spare parts we cannot provide assurances that further cost reduction efforts will prove successful or that customers will accept additional price increases aircraft engines and spare part cost increases coupled with increased costs of insurance for general aviation aircraft owners tend to result in decreasing aftermarket sales of our piston engines and component parts this in turn leaves our discontinued operations more dependent on sales to oems which is more dependent on general economic conditions 

 

for certain electronic components for medical applications that we manufacture such as those that go into cardiac defibrillators we have asked for indemnities from our customers andor to be included under their insurance policies we cannot however provide any assurance that such indemnities or insurance will offset potential liabilities that we may incur as a result of our manufacture of such components additionally while we have been exiting the manufacture of some medical components claims may still arise after such manufacturing ceases 

aside from the uncertainties created by external events that can affect insurance coverages such as the crash of air france flight 447 in the atlantic ocean in june 2009 the american international group inc 2008 failure and bailout the devastating 2005 hurricane season or september 11th events our ability to obtain product liability insurance and the cost for such insurance are affected by our historical claims experience while we have taken steps to improve our claims management process over the last few years we cannot assure that for 2011 and in future years our ability to obtain insurance or the cost for such insurance or the amount of selfinsured retentions reserves or limits will not be negatively impacted by our experience in prior years 

 

our pension expenses and the value of our pension assets are affected by factors outside of our control including the performance of plan assets the stock market interest rates and actuarial data 

 

we have a defined benefit qualified pension plan covering most of our us employees hired prior to 2004 the value of the combined pension assets is currently less than our accumulated pension benefit obligation given our pension plan’s underfunded status in 2004 we began making required cash contributions to our qualified pension plan in 2010 we made pretax cash contributions to our us defined benefit qualified pension plan totaling 370 million all of which was beyond what was required under erisa for 2009 and 2008 pretax cash contributions totaled 1170 million and 587 million respectively in 2011 we currently expect to make a pretax voluntary cash contribution of 370 million plus an additional 320 million pretax voluntary cash contribution if the divestiture of our piston engines businesses is completed the accounting rules applicable to our qualified pension plan require that amounts recognized in the financial statements be determined on an actuarial basis rather than as contributions are made to the plan two significant elements in determining our pension income or pension expense are the expected return on plan assets and the discount rate used in projecting pension benefit obligations declines in the stock market and lower rates of return could increase required contributions to our qualified pension plan any decreases or increases in market interest rates will affect the discount rate assumption used in projecting pension benefit obligations if and to the extent decreases are not offset by voluntary contributions or asset returns our required cash contributions and pension expense could increase under the plans for additional discussion of pension matters see the discussion under “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition” and notes 2 and 12 to notes to consolidated financial statements at the end of 2007 we changed some investment allocations to reduce exposure to deterioration in the subprime mortgage market throughout 2008 and until the latter part of 2009 given market disruptions and volatility we maintained a greater amount in fixed income investments including in us treasury notes to achieve greater stability in our pension assets during the second half of 2009 we began to change our investment strategy to more active management and increase our equity investments due to timing of investment allocation changes we may not have benefited from some upswings in certain investments and in the future we may not benefit from any such upswings to the extent we change investment allocations to meet our current strategy additionally our investment strategy may not be successful if the credit financial or stock markets deteriorate 

 

our future financial results could be adversely impacted by asset impairment charges 

 

under current accounting guidance we are required to test annually both acquired goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment based upon a fair value approach rather than amortizing them over time we have chosen to perform our annual impairment reviews of goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year we also are required to test goodwill for impairment between annual tests if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce our enterprise fair value below its book value these events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate including a significant sustained decline in an entity’s market value legal factors operating performance indicators competition sale or disposition of a significant portion of the business or other factors if the fair market value is less than the carrying value including goodwill we could be required to record an impairment charge the valuation of reporting units requires judgment in estimating future cash flows discount rates and estimated product life cycles in making these judgments we evaluate the financial health of the business including such factors as industry performance changes in technology and operating cash flows as we have grown through acquisitions we have accumulated 5463 million of 

goodwill and have 1139 million of net acquired intangible assets which includes 378 million of indefinitelived intangible assets out of total assets of 15578 million at january 2 2011 as a result the amount of any annual or interim impairment could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our reported financial results for the period in which the charge is taken we also may be required to record an earnings charge or incur unanticipated expenses if as a result of a change in strategy or other reason we were to determine the value of other assets had been impaired 

 

generally accepted accounting principles require that a longlived asset to be disposed of be reported at the lower of its carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell an asset other than goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets is considered impaired when estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset in the event the carrying amount of such asset is not deemed recoverable the asset is adjusted to its estimated fair value fair value is generally determined based upon estimated discounted future cash flows 

 

we may not have sufficient resources to fund all future research and development and capital expenditures or possible acquisitions 

 

in order to remain competitive we must make a substantial investment in research and development of new or enhanced products and continuously upgrade our process technology and manufacturing capabilities in september 2006 we acquired rockwell scientific company llc a provider of research and development services primarily in the areas of electronics optics information sciences and materials technologies with teledyne scientific company in our portfolio we have been more actively promoting and funding joint research and development projects with other teledyne businesses including teledyne brown engineering inc teledyne reynolds inc and our teledyne oil  gas businesses in 2010 we funded 470 million for research and development compared to 451 million in 2009 and 478 million in 2008 our capital expenditures totaled 310 million in 2010 335 million in 2009 and 382 million in 2008 although we believe that anticipated cash flows from operations and available borrowings under our new 5500 million credit facility will be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated working capital research and development and capital investment needs including increased capital spending required by teledyne dalsa we may be unable to fund all of these needs or possible acquisitions our ability to raise additional capital will depend on a variety of factors some of which will not be within our control including the existence of a public offering market investor perceptions of us our businesses and the industries in which we operate and general economic conditions although we successfully issued and sold 2500 million in senior unsecured notes in a private placement transaction in september 2010 we may be unable to successfully raise additional capital if needed failure to successfully raise needed capital on a timely or costeffective basis could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

 

we may be unsuccessful in our efforts to increase our participation in certain new markets 

 

we intend to both adapt our existing technologies and develop new products to expand into new market segments we have been developing new electronic products including highpower solid state microwave devices and tactical military camera systems which are intended to access markets in which teledyne does not currently participate or has limited participation we may be unsuccessful in accessing these and other new markets if our products do not meet our customers’ requirements as a result of changes in either technology and industry standards or because of actions taken by our competitors 

 

limitations in customer funding for applied research and development and technology insertion projects due to the present economic conditions and the significant expenditures in iraq and afghanistan as well as ongoing turmoil in middle eastern countries may reduce our ability to apply our ongoing investments in some market areas for example our engineered systems segment’s development of service oriented architectures for us department of defense applications relies heavily on funding from customers who are actively competing for resources with war driven recapitalization resupply and modernization requirements 

 

teledyne dalsa is reliant on the next generation of job fund which is a grant from a provincial government authority to support research and development expenditures teledyne dalsa is also reliant on 

some government authorities for various tax incentives related to research and development which drive and promote research and development spending changes in the canadian and provincial governments’ policies could inhibit teledyne dalsa’s ability to participate in new markets 

 

as discussed elsewhere herein there has been a downturn in the general aviation market as a direct result of deteriorated economic and credit conditions in the united states and the world generally in addition to our discontinued operations as previously stated this deterioration could further impact battery sales of our aerospace and defense electronics segment while we will try to offset such impact with battery sales to the military and into other applications we may not be able to offset any such impact advanced lithium ion aircraft battery technology could also adversely affect our lead batteries sales and our ability to enter into new oem jet markets 

 

we may be unable to successfully introduce new and enhanced products in a timely and costeffective manner which could harm our growth and prospects 

 

our operating results depend in part on our ability to introduce new and enhanced products on a timely basis successful product development and introduction depend on numerous factors including our ability to anticipate customer and market requirements changes in technology and industry standards our ability to differentiate our offerings from offerings of our competitors and market acceptance we may not be able to develop and introduce new or enhanced products in a timely and costeffective manner or to develop and introduce products that satisfy customer requirements however our involvement through the 2011 acquisition of dalsa in the microelectronic innovation center in bromont quebec canada will provide us with access to a wellequipped mems research and development center which we believe may help to improve our technology development capability 

 

our new products also may not achieve market acceptance or correctly address new industry standards and technological changes as an example we continue to work to develop high power solid state power amplifiers which could replace our traveling wave tubes in some applications and in this field there is a larger base of potential competitors than there is for tube amplifiers as a result it may be more difficult for our solid state power amplifier products to gain market acceptance we may also lose any technological advantage to competitors if we fail to develop new products in a timely manner for example if we fail to timely develop a permanent reservoir monitoring system for deep water applications our growth and prospects in the deep water arena could be hampered 

 

additionally new products may trigger increased warranty costs as such products are tested further by actual usage accelerated entry of new products to meet heightened market demand and competitive pressures may cause additional warranty costs as development and testing time periods might be accelerated or condensed 

 

technological change and evolving industry and regulatory standards could cause certain of our products or services to become obsolete or noncompetitive 

 

the markets for some of our products and services are characterized by rapid technological development evolving industry standards changes in customer requirements and new product introductions and enhancements a faster than anticipated change in one or more of the technologies related to our products or services or in market demand for products or services based on a particular technology could result in faster than anticipated obsolescence of certain of our products or services and could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition for example teledyne reynolds’ high voltage connector business could be negatively impacted by marketplace shifts to lower voltage requirements where the number of competitors is larger most lighting displays in legacy aircraft use illumination devices that require high voltage connectors led backlights which are increasingly being used for aircraft lighting displays have substantially lower voltage requirements 

 

currently accepted industry and regulatory standards are also subject to change which may contribute to the obsolescence of our products or services for example effective july 1 2006 a european directive referred to as rohs or the restriction on hazardous substances directive provided that certain electronic 

products must not contain impermissible levels of lead mercury cadmium hexavalent chromium polybrominated biphenyls or polybrominated diphenyl ethers as a result we must make sure that certain of our electronic products sold into european member states comply with this directive although many of our products are exempt from the european directive we continue to expect that over time component manufacturers may discontinue selling components that have the restricted substances this will in turn require us to accommodate changes in parameters such as the way parts are soldered and may in some cases require redesign of certain products this could lead to increased costs which we may not be able to recover from our customers delays in product shipments and loss of market share to competitors the european union’s 2007adopted registration evaluation authorization and restriction of chemical substance reform legislation commonly referred to as reach which requires registration and selective evaluation of more than 30000 chemical substances that are deemed of high risk to environment health and safety is also expected to have over time an impact on the electronics supply chain similar to the rohs additionally similar laws restricting hazardous substances have been promulgated in various noneuropean countries including china and korea as well as in various us states 

 

revenues of our teledyne test services business which provides testing and certification for products used in nuclear power plants could be negatively impacted in the event of any changes in certification standards by the nuclear regulatory commission 

 

additionally the us environmental protection agency continues to target general aviation fuel as a key contributor to lead in the atmosphere and could try to impose leadfree fuel regulations on general aviation such a change in the fuel standard could have an adverse impact on our discontinued operations including increasing research and development costs in part we have been working to manufacture an engine that uses diesel fuel to address this risk 

 

we may not be able to reduce the costs of our products to satisfy customers’ cost reduction mandates which could harm our sales or margins 

 

more and more customers continue to seek price reductions of our products while we continually work to reduce our manufacturing and other costs of our products without affecting product quality and reliability there is no assurance that we will be able to do so and do so in a timely manner to satisfy the pricing pressures of our customers cost reductions of raw materials and other components used in our products may be beyond our control depending on market credit and economic conditions customers may seek lower cost products from china and other developing countries where manufacturing costs are lower 

 

the airline industry is heavily regulated and if we fail to comply with applicable requirements our results of operations could suffer 

 

governmental agencies throughout the world including the us federal aviation administration or the faa prescribe standards and qualification requirements for aircraft components including virtually all commercial airline and general aviation products as well as regulations regarding the repair and overhaul of aircraft engines specific regulations vary from country to country although compliance with faa requirements generally satisfies regulatory requirements in other countries we include with the products and replacement parts that we sell to our aircraft industry customers documentation certifying that each part complies with applicable regulatory requirements and meets applicable standards of airworthiness established by the faa or the equivalent regulatory agencies in other countries in order to sell our products we and the products we manufacture must also be certified by our individual original equipment manufacturer or oem customers if any material authorization or approval qualifying us to supply our products is revoked or suspended then the sale of the product would be prohibited by law which would have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

from time to time the faa or equivalent regulatory agencies in other countries propose new regulations or changes to existing regulations which are usually more stringent than existing regulations if these proposed regulations are adopted and enacted we may incur significant additional costs to achieve compliance which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

increasing competition could reduce the demand for our products and services 

 

although we believe that we have certain advantages that help us compete in our markets each of our markets is highly competitive many of our competitors have and potential competitors could have greater name recognition a larger installed base of products more extensive engineering manufacturing marketing and distribution capabilities and greater financial technological and personnel resources than we do new or existing competitors may also develop new technologies that could adversely affect the demand for our products and services industry acquisition and consolidation trends particularly among aerospace and defense contractors have adversely impacted demand for our aerospace and defense related engineering services as large prime contractors insource increased amounts of major acquisition programs and also require significant expansion in small business participation to meet government contracting goals lowcost competition from china and other developing countries could also result in decreased demand for our products increasing competition could reduce the volume of our sales or the prices we may charge which would negatively impact our revenues 

 

we sell products to customers in industries that may again undergo rapid and unpredictable changes which could adversely affect our operations results or production levels 

 

we develop and manufacture products for customers in industries that have undergone rapid changes in the past for example we manufacture products and provide manufacturing services to companies that serve telecommunications markets during 2001 many segments of the telecommunications market experienced a dramatic and rapid downturn that resulted in cancellations or deferrals of orders for our products and services this market or others that we serve may exhibit rapid changes in the future and may adversely affect our operating results or our production levels or both we also manufacture products using fuel cell technology which is a market that is not wellestablished and subject to significant change and evolution 

 

our engineered systems segment manufactures gas centrifuge service modules for fluor enterprises inc acting as agent for usec inc used in the american centrifuge project we anticipate increased sales of gas centrifuge service modules in 2011 due to a likely return to full production for the american centrifuge project in may 2010 usec announced that toshiba and babcock and wilcox signed definitive agreements to provide coinvestments of 100 million each in the american centrifuge plant payable in three installments in late july 2010 usec updated its application to the department of energy which triggered the initial investment of 750 million from toshiba and babcock and wilcox in anticipation of a favorable adjudication of its loan application and in light of the investment from the new partners usec began remobilization of the project in early september 2010 however usec has not authorized a return to full production failure to secure the loan guarantees would seriously jeopardize usec’s ability to finance and therefore complete the centrifuge project continuation of this project beyond midyear 2011 may depend on usec receiving a favorable ruling regarding its loan guarantee application if usec does not receive a favorable ruling future funding on this program could be reduced or eliminated in such an event our engineered systems segment may experience reduced sales 

 

our business and financial results could be adversely affected by conditions and other factors associated with our suppliers 

 

some items we purchase for the manufacture of our products including certain gyro components for some marine navigation applications certain magnets and helix wire for our traveling wave tubes and certain infrared detectors substrates are purchased from limited or single sources of supply due to technical capability price and other factors we have also outsourced from time to time the manufacturing of certain parts components subsystems and even finished products to single or limited sources including international sources for example teledyne relays outsources the manufacture of certain relays and relay components to taiwan and india as well as our own facility in mexico teledyne imaging sensors outsources the manufacture of readout integrated circuits for focal plane arrays to a taiwanese foundry disruption of these sources could cause delays or reductions in shipments of our products or increases in our costs which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or operations international sources possess additional risks some of which are similar to those described above in regard to international sales with any continuing 

disruption in the global economy and financial markets some of our suppliers may also continue to face issues gaining access to sufficient credit to maintain their businesses which could reduce the availability of some components and to the extent such suppliers are single source suppliers could adversely affect our ability to continue to manufacture and sell our products continuing economic pressure on suppliers may also trigger increased pricing or workforce reductions or reduced workweeks possibly creating longer lead times to obtain needed components for our products 

 

compliance with increasing environmental and climate change regulations as well as the effects of potential environmental liabilities could have a material adverse financial effect on us 

 

we like other industry participants are subject to various federal state local and international environmental laws and regulations we may be subject to increasingly stringent environmental standards in the future particularly as green house gas emissions and climate change regulations and initiatives increase future developments administrative actions or liabilities relating to environmental and climate change matters could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

 

while we have as part of our overall risk management program an environmental management and compliance program applicable to our operating facilities including a “review and audit” program to monitor compliance where each facility is reviewed and audited by an internal environmental team every three years such program does not eliminate potential environmental liabilities in addition while we conduct environmentalrelated due diligence in acquisitions and generally seek some form of protection including indemnification from a seller companies we acquire may have environmental liabilities that are not accurately assessed or brought to our attention at the time of the acquisition 

 

for additional discussion of environmental matters see the discussion under the caption “other matters — environmental” of “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of results of operation and financial condition” and note 15 to notes to consolidated financial statements 

 

increased environmental regulatory monitoring requirements of the air we breathe and the water we drink could have a favorable effect on the results of operations or financial condition of our instrumentation businesses including the sulfur dioxide carbon monoxide and ozone gas monitoring business of teledyne advanced pollution instrumentation inc the air quality monitoring business of teledyne monitor labs inc the water quality monitoring business of teledyne isco inc and the mercury monitoring business of teledyne leeman labs in contrast the us environmental protection agency’s efforts to limit lead emissions from general aviation gasoline could adversely affect our discontinued operations consequently in part we have been working to manufacture an engine that uses unleaded diesel fuel to address this risk also while our leadacid battery manufacturing facility in redlands ca has scrubbers and other pollution control devices in place additional leadrelated airemission limitations and other requirements could trigger additional expenditures and adversely affect the financial results of our aerospace and defense electronics segment 

 

the us environmental protection agency announced that greenhouse gases ghgs threaten the public health and welfare of the american people epa also maintains that ghg emissions from onroad vehicles contribute to that threat epa’s endangerment finding covers emissions of six greenhouse gases — carbon dioxide methane nitrous oxide hydrofluorocarbons hfc perfluorocarbons pfc and sulfur hexafluoride sf6 epa’s efforts to limit ghg emissions could adversely affect our us manufacturing operations restrictions on carbon dioxide emissions may impact energy fuel and transportation prices restrictions on hfcs pfs and sf6 gases may impact the way these compounds are used and controlled at certain of our facilities this may in turn require us to accommodate changes in parameters such as the way parts are manufactured and may in some cases require redesign of certain products this could lead to increased costs which we may not be able to recover from customers delays in product shipments and loss of market share to competitors 

our inability to attract and retain key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our future success 

 

our future success depends to a significant extent upon the continued service of our executive officers and other key management and technical personnel and on our ability to continue to attract retain and motivate qualified personnel we also have a maturing work force while we have engaged in succession planning the loss of the services of one or more of our key employees or our failure to attract retain and motivate qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

our engineered systems segment has been facing increasing competition for qualified engineering personnel as a result of the department of defense 2005 base realignment and closure also known as brac decisions particularly as positions continue to move to huntsville alabama over the next several years in addition the us secretary of defense announced in 2009 that the department would decrease the use of contractors in support services and increase funding for civil service positions in those areas as a result of this trend our engineered systems segment lost personnel as their jobs were changed from contractor to federal civil service positions this trend may continue in 2011 the engineered systems segment is also losing personnel due to employees pursing vacancies that have been created in various industries as other employees accept employment with the us government 

 

a labor strike or work stoppage could have a material adverse affect on our business 

 

while we believe our overall relations with our employees to be good a labor strike or work stoppage at our unionrepresented or other facilities could have a material adverse effect on us the international union of united automobile aerospace and agricultural implement workers of america represents approximately 250 active employees at our teledyne continental motors piston engine manufacturing facility in mobile alabama under a collective bargaining agreement that expires by its terms on march 20 2013 this union also represents approximately 10 active employees at the teledyne turbine engines facility in toledo ohio under a collective bargaining agreement that expires on november 8 2014 upon expiration of these agreements there can be no assurance that a strike or work stoppage would not occur as teledyne continental motors inc is part of discontinued operations and is subject to divestiture the mobile alabama collective bargaining agreement and the active employees represented thereby will be included with the sale 

 

we may not be able to sell or exit on acceptable terms businesses that we determine no longer meet with our growth strategy 

 

consistent with our growth strategy to focus on markets to expand our profitable niche businesses we continually evaluate our businesses to ensure that they are aligned with our strategy most recently this review led to the decision to sell our general aviation piston engines businesses which sale is expected to close in the 1st quarter of 2011 after the june 2004 acquisition of isco inc we determined that the online process control instrumentation business of its german subsidiary was not aligned with our strategy and in march 2005 we sold this nonstrategic business in 2007 principally because of the decision of a customer to manufacture certain medical products at its facilities in india we closed our contract manufacturing operations in el rubi tijuana mexico and transferred the remaining operations to our la mesa tijuana mexico and our lewisburg tennessee facilities 

 

our ability to dispose of or exit businesses that may no longer be aligned with our growth strategy will depend on many factors including the terms and conditions of any asset purchase and sale agreement as well as industry business and economic conditions we cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to sell nonstrategic businesses on terms that are acceptable to us or at all also if the sale of any nonstrategic business cannot be consummated or is not practical alternative courses of action including closure may not be available to us or may be more costly than anticipated 

natural disasters such as a serious earthquake or wildfire in california a major hurricane in alabama florida or texas or an ice storm in canada as well as manmade environmental disasters such as 2010 gulf of mexico oil spill could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

 

several of our facilities as a result of their locations could be subject to a catastrophic loss caused by earthquakes hurricanes tornados floods ice storms or other natural disasters many of our production facilities and our headquarters are located in california and thus are in areas with above average seismic activity and may also be at risk of damage in wildfires teledyne dalsa’s facility in quebec has in the past been impacted by severe ice storms in addition we have manufacturing facilities in the southeastern united states and texas that have been threatened and struck by major hurricanes our facilities in alabama florida nebraska and tennessee have also been threatened by tornados while teledyne continental motors’ pistonengines manufacturing facility located in mobile alabama which is now part of our discontinued operations and subject to divestiture teledyne geophysical instruments’ facility in houston texas teledyne odi’s facility in daytona beach florida and teledyne odom’s facility in baton rouge louisiana were relatively fortunate with respect to the building damage and business interruption they suffered during the previous hurricane season there can be no assurance that any one of them will be as fortunate in the future if any of our california facilities including our california headquarters were to experience a catastrophic earthquake or wildfire loss or if any of our alabama florida louisiana nebraska tennessee or texas facilities were to experience a catastrophic hurricane storm tornado or other natural disaster such event could disrupt our operations delay production shipments and revenue and result in large expenses to repair or replace the facility or facilities while teledyne has property insurance to partially reimburse it for losses caused by windstorm and earth movement such insurance would not cover all possible losses in addition our existing disaster recovery and business continuity plans including those relating to our information technology systems may not be fully responsive to or minimize losses associated with catastrophic events 

 

the environmental disaster triggered by the deepwater horizon rig explosion and oil spill in 2010 resulted in a moratorium on offshore oil and gas production in the gulf of mexico that adversely affected the results of operations of some of our teledyne oil and gas businesses although such adverse impact was offset in part by the products we manufacture that supported wellcapping and environmental cleanup efforts similar future manmade disasters that limit or cease offshore oil and gas production or further exploration in the regions in which we sell our products could have a material adverse affect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

 

we may not be able to enforce or protect our intellectual property rights which may harm our ability to compete and harm our business 

 

our ability to enforce our patents copyrights software licenses and other intellectual property rights is subject to general litigation risks as well as uncertainty as to the enforceability of our intellectual property rights in various countries when we seek to enforce our rights we are often subject to claims that the intellectual property right is invalid is otherwise not enforceable or is licensed to the party against whom we are asserting a claim in addition as our teledyne controls business has experienced our assertion of intellectual property rights often results in the other party seeking to assert alleged intellectual property rights of its own or assert other claims against us if we are not ultimately successful in defending ourselves against these claims in litigation we may not be able to sell a particular product or family of products due to an injunction or we may have to pay damages that could in turn harm our results of operations our inability to enforce our intellectual property rights under these circumstances may harm our competitive position and our business 

 

our financial statements are based on estimates required by gaap and actual results may differ materially from those estimated under different assumptions or conditions 

 

our financial statements are prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states these principles require our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of 

revenue and expenses during the reporting period for example estimates are used when accounting for items such as asset valuations allowances for doubtful accounts depreciation and amortization impairment assessments employee benefits taxes recall costs aircraft product and general liability and contingencies while we base our estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances at the time made actual results may differ materially from those estimated 

 

while we believe our internal control systems are effective there are inherent limitations in all control systems and misstatements resulting from error or fraud may occur and may not be detected 

 

we continue to take action to assure compliance with the internal controls disclosure controls and other requirements of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer cannot guarantee that our internal controls and disclosure controls will prevent all possible errors or all fraud a control system no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met in addition the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefit of controls must be relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no system of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within the company have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake further controls can be circumvented by individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more persons or by management override of the controls the design of any system of controls is also based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions over time a control may be inadequate because of changes in conditions or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate because of inherent limitations in a costeffective control system misstatements resulting from error or fraud may occur and may not be detected 

 

provisions of our governing documents applicable law and our change in control severance agreements could make an acquisition of teledyne technologies more difficult 

 

our restated certificate of incorporation our amended and restated bylaws and the general corporation law of the state of delaware contain several provisions that could make the acquisition of control of teledyne in a transaction not approved by our board of directors more difficult we have also entered into change in control severance agreements with 16 members of our management which could have an antitakeover effect these provisions may prevent or discourage attempts to acquire our company 

 

the market price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly since our spinoff from ati and could continue to do so 

 

since the spinoff from ati on november 29 1999 the market price of our common stock has ranged from a low of 76875 to a high of 6621 per share during 2010 alone the market price of our common stock ranged from 3534 to 4525 per share at february 25 2011 our closing stock price was 5257 fluctuations in our stock price could continue among the factors that could affect our stock price are

the stock markets in general and the markets for high technology companies in particular have experienced a high degree of volatility that is not necessarily related to the operating performance of these companies we cannot provide assurances as to our stock price

 item 1b unresolved staff comments tableend  

by letter dated february 28 2011 the staff of the division of corporation finance at the securities and exchange commission has informed us that there remains an unresolved comment with respect to the staff’s review of our annual report on form 10k for the fiscal year ended january 3 2010 filed on march 2 2010 the staff believes that each of our business units are operating segments and that any aggregation of operating segments into reportable segments should begin at the business unit level and that our fiscal 2010 form 10k disclosure should reflect this approach we have determined that our reporting business units are aggregated into four reportable segments not including discontinued operations as set forth in this 2010 form 10k after an extensive and careful review including consultation with the audit committee of our board of directors and our external auditors including their national office we believe our determination of operating segments and reportable segments is consistent with applicable accounting literature including accounting standards board accounting standards codification asc 280 — segment reporting we have determined that there is no impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets if impairment testing is performed at the reporting business unit level we will continue to work with the securities and exchange commission to resolve this comment if the sec does not agree with us we may amend and restate our 2010 form 10k to reflect a different reporting segment structure

 item 3 legal proceedings tableend  

from time to time we become involved in various lawsuits claims and proceedings related to the conduct of our business including those pertaining to product liability patent infringement commercial employment and employee benefits while we cannot predict the outcome of any lawsuit claim or proceeding our management does not believe that the disposition of any pending matters is likely to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or liquidity the resolution in any reporting period of one or more of these matters however could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations for that period 

 

in march 2009 cold creek enterprises inc and bob disilva commenced a lawsuit against dalsa corporation and certain related entities in the ontario superior court of justice the claims originate from the interest of mr disilva’s company in dalsa digital camera inc a joint venture entered into in november 2004 and now a discontinued business of dalsa the lawsuit seeks various forms of relief including damages in excess of cad 20 million the lawsuit is being vigorously defended and a counterclaim has been filed against the plaintiff

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation tableend  

teledyne technologies incorporated is a leading provider of sophisticated electronic components and subsystems instrumentation and communications products including defense electronics digital imaging products and software monitoring and control instrumentation for marine environmental and industrial applications harsh environment interconnect products data acquisition and communications equipment for air transport and business aircraft and components and subsystems for wireless and satellite communications we also provide engineered systems and information technology services for defense space environmental and nuclear applications and supply energy generation energy storage and small propulsion products 

 

we serve niche market segments where performance precision and reliability are critical our customers include government agencies aerospace prime contractors energy exploration and production companies major industrial companies and airlines 

 

strategyoverview 

 

our strategy continues to emphasize growth in our core markets of instrumentation digital imaging aerospace and defense electronics and government engineered systems our core markets are characterized by high barriers to entry and include specialized products and services not likely to be commoditized we intend to strengthen and expand our core businesses with targeted acquisitions we aggressively pursue operational excellence to continually improve our margins and earnings at teledyne operational excellence includes the rapid integration of the businesses we acquire over time our goal is to create a set of businesses that are truly superior in their niches we continue to evaluate our businesses to ensure that they are aligned with our strategy 

 

consistent with this strategy we made three acquisitions in 2010 and in december 2010 we entered into an agreement to sell our general aviation piston engines businesses which comprised the former aerospace engines and components segment accordingly our consolidated financial statements have been restated to classify the aerospace engines and components segment as a discontinued operation we expect the sale to close in the first quarter of 2011 pending satisfaction of final closing conditions 

 

in addition for 2010 we realigned and changed the reporting structure of some of our businesses our former electronics and communications segment is now reported as three separate segments instrumentation digital imaging and aerospace and defense electronics the businesses that comprised the energy and power systems segment are now reported as part of the aerospace and defense electronics and the engineered systems segments the battery products business with revenues of 155 million in 2010 is now part of the aerospace and defense electronics segment and the onsite gas and power generation systems and the turbine engine businesses with combined revenues of 539 million in 2010 are now part of the engineered systems segment we have restated our previously reported segment data to reflect this revised segment reporting structure and the classification of the former aerospace engines and components segment as a discontinued operation 

 

in 2010 sales totaled 16442 million compared with sales of 16521 million for 2009 our 2010 net income totaled 1205 million or a record 327 per diluted share compared to 1133 million or 310 per diluted share in 2009 net income for 2010 excluding our discontinued operations was 1199 million or 325 per diluted share compared with 1159 million or 317 per diluted share for 2009 in 2010 a greater proportion of sales and operating profit were derived from sales of marine and environmental instrumentation products of our instrumentation segment and from sales of our microwave devices and interconnect products of our aerospace and defense electronics segment our 2010 record earnings per share was achieved despite lower sales of missile defense engineering services nasa programs gas centrifuge modules and turbine engines related to the joint airtosurface standoff missile “jassm” program of our engineered systems segment in 2011 we expect our business mix to evolve further including as a result of our recent acquisitions we do not expect our engineered systems segment to experience a contraction similar to 2010 

 

in early 2011 we completed the acquisition of dalsa corporation “dalsa” dalsa a canadian company is a designer and manufacturer of digital imaging products as well as semiconductor wafers and components among other things our combined digital imaging technologies should allow us to develop new infrared and visible light products for our respective markets and customers with the recently completed acquisition of dalsa and subject to the divestiture of our general aviation piston engines businesses we will be transformed into an electronics digital imaging instrumentation and engineering focused company 

in addition to the above events on february 25 2011 we replaced our 5900 million credit facility that was set to expire in july 2011 with a 5500 million credit facility the new facility together with the 2500 million in senior notes issued in september 2010 and operating cash flow will provide teledyne with the ability to fund working capital needs capital expenditures voluntary pension contributions debt service requirements and acquisitions for 2011 the anticipated proceeds from the expected sale of our general aviation piston engine businesses will initially be used to repay amounts outstanding under our 5500 million credit facility 

 

recent acquisitions 

 

the following summarizes the acquisitions we made during fiscal years 2010 2009 and 2008 other than the purchase of the assets of a marine sensor product line for 14 million and all of the remaining 141 minority interest in ocean design inc “odi” for 255 million no other acquisitions were made in fiscal year 2009 see note 3 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information about our recent acquisitions see also note 17 to our consolidated financial statements for information about our fiscal year 2011 acquisition of dalsa

we reported 2010 sales of 16442 million compared with sales of 16521 million for 2009 a slight decrease of 05 net income attributable to teledyne technologies was 1205 million 327 per diluted share for 2010 compared with 1133 million 310 per diluted share for 2009 an increase of 64 net income attributable to teledyne technologies excluding discontinued operations was 1199 million 325 per diluted share for 2010 compared with 1159 million 317 per diluted share for 2009 an increase of 34 

 

the decrease in sales in 2010 compared with 2009 reflected lower sales in the engineered systems segment and the digital imaging segment partially offset by higher sales in both the instrumentation segment and in the aerospace and defense electronics segment the decrease in the engineered systems segment reflected lower sales of missile defense engineering services lower sales from nasa programs lower sales of gas centrifuge service modules and lower sales related to the joint airtosurface standoff missile “jassm” turbine engine program partially offset by sales of 63 million from a recent acquisition sales in the instrumentation segment reflected higher sales of marine and environmental instrumentation products sales in the aerospace and defense electronics segment reflected higher sales of microwave devices and interconnects 

and included sales of 159 million from recent acquisitions the incremental increase in revenue in 2010 from businesses acquired since 2009 see “recent acquisitions” table was 253 million 

 

the increase in segment operating profit and other segment income for 2010 compared with 2009 reflected higher operating profit in the instrumentation segment partially offset by lower operating profit in the aerospace and defense electronics segment the engineered systems segment and the digital imaging segment the increase in operating profit in the instrumentation segment was in line with higher sales the decrease in operating profit in the aerospace and defense electronics segment reflected charges of 82 million primarily to correct inventory valuations incorrectly recorded in previous periods at a business unit partially offset by the impact of higher sales the decrease in operating profit in the engineered systems segment reflected the impact of lower sales partially offset by lower pension expense and higher margins operating profit included an incremental operating loss from our 2010 acquisitions of 51 million which included acquisition expenses of 55 million and intangible amortization of 15 million 

 

cost of sales in total dollars was lower in 2010 compared with 2009 and reflected the impact of lower pension expense and cost reductions partially offset by the 82 million charge to correct inventory valuations cost of sales in 2010 included 08 million in lifo expense compared with 22 million of lifo income in 2009 cost of sales as a percentage of sales for 2010 was 698 compared with 713 for 2009 the lower cost of sales percentage reflected the impact of cost reductions product mix and lower pension expense partially offset by the impact of the 82 million inventory writedown 

 

selling general and administrative expenses including research and development and bid and proposal expense in total dollars were higher in 2010 compared with 2009 the 142 million increase was primarily due to higher general and administrative expense the higher general and administrative expense included 67 million in acquisition and disposition related expenses as well as 15 million in intangible asset amortization for recent acquisitions corporate administrative expense in 2010 was higher by 15 million compared with 2009 and reflected higher employee compensation expenses for 2010 we recorded a total of 47 million in stock option expense of which 17 million was recorded as corporate expense and 30 million was recorded in segment results for 2009 we recorded a total of 52 million in stock option expense of which 18 million was recorded as corporate expense and 34 million was recorded in segment results selling general and administrative expenses for 2010 as a percentage of sales increased to 193 compared with 184 for 2009 and reflected the impact of acquisition related expenses 

 

included in operating profit in 2010 was domestic pension expense of 48 million of which 96 million was recoverable in accordance with us government cost accounting standards “cas” from certain government contracts included in operating profit in 2009 was domestic pension expense of 214 million of which 124 million was recoverable in accordance with cas pension expense determined under cas can generally be recovered through the pricing of products and services sold to the us government these amounts do not include pension expense of 04 million in 2010 and 11 million in 2009 now included as part of discontinued operations in addition to the above amounts the company recorded 01 million in pension expense for 2010 related to the foreign pension plan acquired as part of the intelek acquisition 

 

the company’s effective tax rate for 2010 was 309 compared with 300 for 2009 fiscal years 2010 and 2009 included net tax credits of 125 million and 150 million respectively primarily research and development tax credits excluding the net tax credits the effective tax rates for 2010 and 2009 would have been 381 and 391 respectively 

 

during the next twelve months it is reasonably possible that tax audit resolutions and expirations of the statutes of limitations could reduce unrecognized tax benefits by 24 million either because our tax positions are sustained on audit because the company agrees to their disallowance or because of the expiration of the statutes of limitations 

 

sales under contracts with the us government were approximately 44 of sales in 2010 and 47 of sales in 2009 sales to international customers represented approximately 29 of sales in 2010 and 26 of sales in 2009 

total interest expense including credit facility fees and other bank charges was 69 million in 2010 and 51 million in 2009 interest income was 04 million in 2010 and 03 million in 2009 the increase in interest expense in 2010 primarily reflected higher average interest rates partially offset by lower outstanding debt levels 

 

noncontrolling interest in subsidiaries’ earnings reflects the minority ownership interest in odi in 2009 and teledyne energy systems inc in both 2010 and 2009 the lower amount in 2010 primarily reflects the decrease in minority ownership interest in odi due to share purchases by teledyne in 2009 in 2009 teledyne purchased the remaining minority interest in odi 

 

other income and expense in 2010 and 2009 included sublease rental income and royalty income and deferred compensation expense other income in 2010 also includes an insurance benefit of 07 million

the decrease in sales in 2009 compared with 2008 reflected lower sales in each segment due to the general economic downturn in 2009 sales in both the instrumentation segment and in the aerospace and defense electronics segment included the impact of acquisitions made in fiscal 2008 the incremental increase in revenue in 2009 from businesses acquired since 2008 see “recent acquisitions” table in the 

instrumentation segment and in the aerospace and defense electronics segment was 242 million and 161 million respectively 

 

operating profit and other segment income was lower in each segment the decrease in segment operating profit and other segment income for 2009 compared with 2008 reflected the impact of lower sales due to the general economic downturn in 2009 operating profit in both the instrumentation segment and in the aerospace and defense electronics segment included incremental operating profit from acquisitions and related synergies of 12 million and 01 million respectively 

 

cost of sales in total dollars was lower in 2009 compared with 2008 primarily due to lower sales cost of sales in 2009 included 22 million in lifo income compared with 01 million in lifo expense in 2008 cost of sales as a percentage of sales for 2009 was 713 compared with 700 for 2008 the higher cost of sales percentage reflected the impact of lower sales and increased pension expense partially offset by cost reductions made throughout the year 

 

selling general and administrative expenses including research and development and bid and proposal expense in total dollars were lower in 2009 compared with 2008 this 141 million decrease was primarily due to lower sales lower acquired intangible asset amortization of 35 million lower corporate administrative expense and lower stock option expense corporate administrative expense in 2009 was lower by 23 million compared with 2008 and reflected reduced employee compensation and professional fee expenses for 2009 we recorded a total of 52 million in stock option expense of which 18 million was recorded as corporate expense and 34 million was recorded in segment results for 2008 we recorded a total of 72 million in stock option expense of which 25 million was recorded as corporate expense and 47 million was recorded in segment results selling general and administrative expenses for 2009 as a percentage of sales were 184 for both 2009 and 2008

segments 

 

the following discussion of our four segments should be read in conjunction with note 13 to the notes to consolidated financial statements such discussion also reflects the classification of our former aerospace engines and components segment as a discontinued operation 

 

instrumentation 

 

 

 

our instrumentation segment provides monitoring and control instrumentation for marine environmental scientific industrial and defense applications and harsh environment interconnect products 

 

2010 compared with 2009

the 2009 sales decrease of 249 million primarily reflected lower sales of avionics electronic relays and microwave products partially offset by 161 million in revenue from acquisitions sales of interconnect systems also decreased slightly in 2009 operating profit including synergies included 01 million due to the incremental impact of acquisitions segment operating profit was negatively impacted by the decrease in revenue and higher pension expense pension expense was 82 million in 2009 compared with 29 million in 2008 pension expense allocated to contracts pursuant to cas was 24 million in 2009 compared with 19 million for 2008 

 

segment operating profit included 12 million of stock option compensation expense in 2009 compared with 17 million of stock option compensation expense in 2008 segment operating profit in 2009 also reflected lifo income of 17 million compared with lifo income of 07 million in 2008 

 

engineered systems 

 

 

 

our engineered systems segment principally through teledyne brown engineering inc provides innovative systems engineering and integration advanced technology application software development and manufacturing solutions to space military environmental energy chemical biological and nuclear systems and missile defense requirements this segment also designs and manufactures hydrogen gas generators thermoelectric and fuelcell based power sources and small turbine engines 

2010 compared with 2009 

 

our engineered systems segment sales were 3338 million in 2010 compared with sales of 4072 million in 2009 a decrease of 180 operating profit was 304 million in 2010 compared with 313 million in 2009 a decrease of 29 

 

sales for 2010 compared with 2009 primarily reflected lower revenue from engineered products and services as well as turbine engine programs sales of engineered products and services declined 670 million as a result of lower sales of missile defense engineering services nasa programs and gas centrifuge service modules partially offset by 63 million in sales from the acquisition of the cml division of intelek the revenue decline of 115 million in turbine engine programs reflected lower sales of turbine engines for the jassm program fiscal year 2010 included higher sales of 51 million of commercial and government energy systems operating profit for 2010 reflected the impact of lower revenue and disposition related costs of 12 million related to the reduction of organizational conflict of interest business activity partially offset by lower pension expense and higher margins related to the jassm program 

 

segment operating profit included pension expense of 16 million in 2010 compared with 120 million in 2009 pension expense allocated to contracts pursuant to cas was 71 million in 2010 compared with 100 million in 2009 

 

in 2011 we do not expect our engineered systems segment to experience a contraction similar to 2010 while missile defense engineering services and nasa programs are expected to decline sales of gas centrifuge service modules jassm turbine engines and other manufacturing programs are expected to increase 

 

2009 compared with 2008 

 

our engineered systems segment sales were 4072 million in 2009 compared with sales of 4313 million in 2008 a decrease of 56 operating profit was 313 million in 2009 compared with 420 million in 2008 a decrease of 255 

 

sales for 2009 compared with 2008 primarily reflected lower revenue from engineered products and services as well as reduced sales of energy systems sales of engineered products and services declined 143 million primarily as a result of lower sales from missile defense engineering services and nasa programs the revenue decline of 65 million for energy systems reflected lower commercial hydrogen generators partially offset by increased sales of power systems for government applications the revenue decline of 33 million related to turbine engines reflected lower research and development sales operating profit for 2009 reflected the impact of lower revenue and higher pension expense 

 

segment operating profit included pension expense of 120 million in 2009 compared with 53 million in 2008 pension expense allocated to contracts pursuant to cas was 100 million in 2009 compared with 79 million in 2008 operating profit in 2009 reflected a 10 million product replacement reserve for commercial hydrogen generators operating profit in 2008 was favorably impacted by 13 million for environmental reserves no longer needed due to a final settlement 

 

financial condition liquidity and capital resources 

 

principal capital requirements 

 

our principal capital requirements are to fund working capital needs capital expenditures voluntary and required pension contributions debt service requirements and acquisitions including the acquisition of dalsa it is anticipated that operating cash flow together with available borrowings under the credit facility described below will be sufficient to meet these requirements and could be used to fund some acquisitions in the year 2011 to support acquisitions we may need to raise additional capital our liquidity is not dependent upon the use of offbalance sheet financial arrangements we have no offbalance sheet financing arrangements that incorporate the use of special purpose entities or unconsolidated entities 

revolving credit agreement and senior notes 

 

teledyne’s amended and restated credit facility had lender commitments totaling 5900 million and was set to expire on july 14 2011 excluding interest and fees no payments were due under the amended and restated credit facility until it matured on february 25 2011 we refinanced the 5900 million credit facility by terminating the facility and entering into a new facility that has lender commitments totaling 5500 million the new facility has a termination date of february 25 2016 as of february 25 2011 we had 2730 million outstanding on the new facility the new facility requires the company to comply with various financial and operating covenants including maintaining certain consolidated leverage and interest coverage ratios excluding interest and fees no payments are due under the 5500 million facility until it matures borrowings under our credit facility are at variable rates which are at our option tied to a eurocurrency rate equal to libor london interbank offered rate plus an applicable rate or a base rate as defined in our credit agreement eurocurrency rate loans may be denominated in us dollars or an alternative currency as defined in the agreement eurocurrency or libor based loans under the facility typically have terms of one two three or six months and the interest rate for each such loan is subject to change if the loan is continued or converted following the applicable maturity date base rate loans have interest rates that primarily fluctuate with changes in the prime rate interest rates are also subject to change based on our consolidated leverage ratio as defined in the credit agreement the credit agreement also provides for facility fees that vary between 020 and 045 of the credit line depending on our consolidated leverage ratio as calculated from time to time 

 

on september 15 2010 taking advantage of favorable longterm borrowing rates the company issued 2500 million in aggregate principal amount of private placement senior notes at par the notes consist of 750 million of 404 senior notes due september 15 2015 1000 million of 474 senior notes due september 15 2017 and 750 million of 530 senior notes due september 15 2020 the interest rates for the notes were determined on april 14 2010 the company used the proceeds of the private placement senior notes to pay down amounts outstanding under the company’s then existing 5900 million credit facility 

 

the credit agreements require the company to comply with various financial and operating covenants including maintaining certain consolidated leverage and interest coverage ratios as well as minimum net worth levels and limits on acquired debt at january 2 2011 the company was in compliance with these covenants and we had a significant amount of margin between required financial covenant ratios and our actual ratios currently we do not believe our ability to undertake additional debt financing if needed is reasonably likely to be materially impacted by debt restrictions under our credit agreements subject to our complying with required financial covenants listed in the table below at january 2 2011 the required financial covenant ratios and the actual ratios were as follows 

 

5900 million credit facility expires july 2011 — terminated february 25 2011 

 

 

 

2500 million private placement notes due 2015 2017 and 2020 

 

 

5500 million credit facility expires february 2016 if it had been in effect 

 

 

 

 

  

available capacity under the now terminated 5900 million credit facility was 5893 million at january 2 2011 the maximum amount that could be borrowed under our credit facility as of january 2 2011 while still remaining in compliance with our consolidated leverage ratio covenant was 4232 million 

 

in the first and second quarters of 2010 teledyne entered into cash flow hedges of forecasted interest payments associated with the then anticipated issuance of fixed rate debt the objective of these cash flow hedges was to protect against the risk of changes in the interest payments attributable to changes in the designated benchmark which is the libor interest rate leading up to the fixed rate on the anticipated issuance of fixed rate debt being locked the notional amount of the debt hedged was 1500 million in the second quarter concurrent with the interest rates being determined on the fixed rate debt teledyne terminated the cash flow hedges for a total payment of 06 million since the cash flow hedges were considered effective changes in the fair value of the hedge contract as of the termination date were deferred in accumulated other comprehensive loss amounts deferred in accumulated other comprehensive loss will be reclassified to interest expense over the same period of time that interest expense is recognized on the borrowings beginning september 15 2010 as of january 2 2011 the remaining unamortized loss of 06 million was included in accumulated other comprehensive loss in the stockholders’ equity section of the balance sheet 

 

contractual obligations 

 

the following table summarizes our expected cash outflows resulting from financial contracts and commitments at january 2 2011 we have not included information on our normal recurring purchases of 

materials for use in our operations these amounts are generally consistent from year to year closely reflect our levels of production and are not longterm in nature in millions 

 

 

 

 

  

at january 2 2011 we are not required to make any cash contributions to the domestic qualified pension plan for 2011 teledyne expects to make a voluntary pretax contribution to its domestic qualified pension plan of approximately 370 million in the first quarter of 2011 and expects to make an additional 320 million pretax contribution provided the sale of the former aerospace engines and components segment is completed teledyne has no required or scheduled contributions to its foreign pension plan for 2011 based on current assumptions and expected contributions to be made in 2011 we would not have a minimum qualified pension plan funding requirement as set forth by erisa in 2012 our minimum funding requirements after 2010 are dependent on several factors as discussed under “accounting for pension plans” in the critical accounting policies section of this management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation estimates beyond 2011 have not been provided due to the significant uncertainty of these amounts which are subject to change until the company’s pension assumptions can be updated at the appropriate times in addition certain pension contributions are eligible for future recovery through the pricing of products and services to the us government under certain government contracts therefore the amounts noted are not necessarily indicative of the impact these contributions may have on our liquidity we also have payments due under our other postretirement benefits plans these plans are not required to be funded in advance but are pay as you go see further discussion in note 12 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

 

operating activities 

 

in 2010 net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations was 1271 million compared with 1604 million in 2009 and 1202 million in 2008 

 

the lower net cash provided for 2010 compared with 2009 reflected higher income tax payments of 492 million higher deferred accounts receivable and higher accounts receivable due to timing of sales partially offset by lower pretax pension contributions of 719 million 

 

the higher net cash provided for 2009 compared with 2008 reflected lower income tax payments of 342 million the incremental cash contribution from acquisitions made in 2008 and improved working capital management partially offset by higher pretax pension contributions of 583 million 

free cash flow cash from operating activities from continuing operations less capital expenditures was 1242 million compared with 1980 million in 2009 and 1177 million in 2008 

 

 

 

 

  

working capital 

 

working capital increased to 3068 million at yearend 2010 compared with 2425 million at yearend 2009 the increase in working capital reflected the higher cash balances and higher accounts receivables the higher cash balance reflects unused cash proceeds from the private placement of debt in september 2010 the higher accounts receivables balance reflects higher deferred accounts receivable and timing of sales 

 

balance sheet changes 

 

the changes in the following selected components of teledyne’s balance sheet are discussed below in millions 

 

 

 

the higher cash balance reflects unused cash proceeds from the private placement of debt in september 2010 the higher balance in accounts receivable reflected higher deferred accounts receivable and timing of sales the decrease in longterm deferred income taxes was primarily due to the pension contributions in 2010 the increase in goodwill reflected current year acquisitions the increase in acquired intangible assets primarily reflected current year acquisitions partially offset by amortization the increase in longterm debt and capital lease obligations primarily reflected issuance of 2500 million of private placement debt partially offset by cash used for acquisitions and the repayment of the amended and restated credit facility the accrued pension obligation decreased primarily as a result of pension contributions and a decrease in the unfunded pension liability in 2010 due to the increase in pension assets during the year resulting from positive market returns partially offset by the inclusion of the intelek defined benefit pension plan that the company assumed responsibility for in connection with the acquisition of intelek 

investing activities 

 

net cash used in investing activities included capital expenditures as presented below in millions 

 

capital expenditures 

 

 

 

during 2011 we plan to invest approximately 500 million to 550 million in capital expenditures principally to upgrade capital equipment reduce manufacturing costs and introduce new products commitments at january 2 2011 for capital expenditures were approximately 56 million 

 

investing activities from continuing operations used cash for acquisitions of 679 million 271 million and 2849 million in fiscal 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively see “recent acquisitions” table we received 04 million in 2008 from the sale of assets 

 

teledyne funded the acquisitions primarily from borrowings under its credit facility and cash on hand 

 

in all acquisitions the results of operations and cash flows are included in our consolidated financial statements form the date of each respective acquisition each of the acquisitions is part of the instrumentation segment except the optimum intelek storm filtronic judson and demo acquisitions storm filtronic and demo are part of the aerospace and defense electronics segment intelek is part of the aerospace and defense electronics segment except for the cml division of intelek which is part of the engineered systems segment optimum and judson are part of the digital imaging segment 

 

the following table shows the purchase price goodwill acquired and intangible assets acquired for the acquisitions made in fiscal 2010 and 2008 in millions 

 

 

 

 

  

 

 

 

  

except for the gavia storm and demo acquisitions goodwill resulting from the acquisitions made in fiscal 2010 and 2008 will be deductible for tax purposes

teledyne’s amended and restated credit facility had lender commitments of 5900 million and was set to expire in july 2011 at yearend 2010 we had 5893 million of available committed credit under the credit facility which can be utilized as needed for daily operating and periodic cash needs including acquisitions excluding interest and fees no payments were due under the amended and restated credit facility until it matures borrowings under this credit facility were at variable rates which were at our option tied to a eurodollar base rate equal to libor london interbank offered rate plus an applicable rate or a base rate as 

defined in our credit agreement libor based loans under the facility typically had terms of one two three or six months and the interest rate for each such loan is subject to change if the loan is continued or converted following the applicable maturity date base rate loans had interest rates that primarily fluctuate with changes in the prime rate interest rates were also subject to change based on our debt to earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization “ebitda” ratio the credit agreement also provided for facility fees that vary between 010 and 025 of the credit line depending on our consolidated leverage ratio as calculated from time to time as noted earlier on february 25 2011 we refinanced the 5900 million credit facility by terminating the facility and entering into a new facility that has lender commitments totaling 5500 million the new facility has a termination date of february 25 2016 as of february 25 2011 we had 2730 million outstanding on the new facility

the credit agreements require the company to comply with various financial and operating covenants including maintaining certain consolidated leverage and interest coverage ratios as well as minimum net worth levels and limits on acquired debt we also have a 50 million uncommitted credit line which permits credit extensions up to 50 million plus an incremental 65 million solely for standby letters of credit there were no outstanding funding advances under the uncommitted credit line at january 2 2011 total debt at yearend 2010 includes 2500 million outstanding in senior notes no amounts were outstanding under the now terminated 5900 million credit facility at yearend 2010 the company also has 173 million outstanding under capital leases of which 20 million is current at yearend 2010 teledyne had 122 million in outstanding letters of credit 

 

in 2009 teledyne repurchased 36239 shares of teledyne common stock for 08 million under this nowexpired program no shares were repurchased in 2010 

 

pension and postretirement plans 

 

as of january 1 2004 nonunion new hires participate in an enhanced defined contribution plan as opposed to the company’s existing defined benefit pension plan the plan was closed to all union new hires as of february 20 2007 teledyne anticipates making pretax cash contributions of approximately 370 million to its domestic pension plan in 2011 before recovery from the us government and expects to make an additional pretax cash contribution of 320 million provided the sale of the former aerospace engines and components segment is completed in connection with the acquisition of intelek the company assumed responsibility for a defined benefit pension plan based in the united kingdom covering certain employees of intelek the plan was closed to new members in january 2000 and ceased further service accruals to members in september 2002 

 

other matters 

 

income taxes 

 

the company’s effective tax rate for 2010 was 309 compared with 300 for 2009 and 368 for 2008 fiscal years 2010 2009 and 2008 included net tax credits of 125 million 150 million and 33 million respectively primarily research and development tax credits excluding these items the company’s effective tax rates for fiscal years 2010 2009 and 2008 would have been 381 391 and 385 respectively based on the company’s history of operating earnings expectations of future operating earnings and potential tax planning strategies it is more likely than not that the deferred income tax assets at january 2 2011 will be realized 

costs and pricing 

 

inflationary trends in recent years have been moderate current inventory costs the increasing costs of equipment and other costs are considered in establishing sales pricing policies the company emphasizes cost containment in all aspects of its business 

 

hedging activities market risk disclosures 

 

in the first and second quarters of 2010 teledyne entered into cash flow hedges of forecasted interest payments associated with the then anticipated issuance of fixed rate debt the objective of these cash flow hedges was to protect against the risk of changes in the interest payments attributable to changes in the designated benchmark which is the libor interest rate leading up to the fixed rate on the anticipated issuance of fixed rate debt being locked the notional amount of the debt hedged was 1500 million in the second quarter concurrent with the interest rates being determined on the fixed rate debt teledyne terminated the cash flow hedges for a total payment of 06 million except for the cash flow hedges we have not entered into any derivative financial instruments such as futures contracts options and swaps forward foreign exchange contracts or interest rate swaps and futures during 2010 or 2009 we had no derivative financial instruments outstanding at january 2 2011 we believe that adequate controls are in place to monitor any hedging activities our primary exposure to market risk relates to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates we periodically evaluate these risks and have taken measures to mitigate these risks we own assets and operate facilities in countries that have been politically stable also our foreign risk management objectives are geared towards stabilizing cash flow from the effects of foreign currency fluctuations most of our sales are denominated in us dollars which mitigates the effect of exchange rate changes borrowings under our credit facility are at fixed rates that vary with the term and timing of each loan under the facility loans under the facility typically have terms of one two three or six months and the interest rate for each such loan is subject to change if the loan is continued or converted following the applicable maturity date interest rates are also subject to change based on our debt to earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization ratio however as of january 2 2011 we had no outstanding indebtedness under our amended and restated credit facility any borrowings under the company’s revolving credit line are based on a fluctuating market interest rate and consequently the fair value of any outstanding debt should not be affected materially by changes in market interest rates on february 25 2011 we refinanced the 5900 million credit facility by terminating the facility and entering into a new facility that has lender commitments totaling 5500 million the new facility has a termination date of february 25 2016 as of february 25 2011 we had 2730 million outstanding on the new facility

until its expiration in november 2009 bny mellon shareowner services was the rights agent under our shareholder rights plan 

 

environmental 

 

we are subject to various federal state local and international environmental laws and regulations which require that we investigate and remediate the effects of the release or disposal of materials at sites associated with past and present operations these include sites at which teledyne has been identified as a potentially responsible party under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act commonly known as superfund and comparable state laws we are currently involved in the investigation and remediation of a number of sites reserves for environmental investigation and remediation totaled 52 million at january 2 2011 and 30 million at january 3 2010 the increase from 2009 reflects environmental liabilities assumed in the intelek acquisition as investigation and remediation of these sites proceed and new information is received the company expects that accruals will be adjusted to reflect new information based on current information we do not believe that future environmental costs in excess of those already accrued will materially and adversely affect our financial condition or liquidity however resolution of one or more of these environmental matters or future accrual adjustments in any one reporting period could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations for that period see also our environmental risk factor disclosure beginning at page 34 

 

for additional discussion of environmental matters see notes 2 and 15 to the notes to consolidated financial statements 

 

government contracts 

 

we perform work on a number of contracts with the department of defense and other agencies and departments of the us government including subcontracts with government prime contractors sales under these contracts with the us government which included contracts with the department of defense were approximately 44 of total sales in 2010 47 of total sales in 2009 and 44 of total sales in 2008 for a summary of sales to the us government by segment see note 13 to the notes to consolidated financial statements sales to the department of defense represented approximately 34 36 and 32 of total sales for 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively see also our government contracts risks factor disclosure beginning at page 20 

 

performance under government contracts has certain inherent risks that could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business results of operations and financial condition government contracts are conditioned upon the continuing availability of congressional appropriations which usually occurs on a fiscal year basis even though contract performance may take more than one year 

 

for information on accounts receivable from the us government see note 5 to the notes to consolidated financial statements 

 

estimates and reserves 

 

our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent liabilities on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including those related to product returns and replacements allowance for doubtful accounts inventories intangible assets income taxes warranty obligations pension and other postretirement benefits longterm contracts environmental workers’ compensation and general liability employee dental and medical benefits and other contingencies and litigation we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances at the time the results of which form the basis for making our judgments actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions 

or conditions in some cases such differences may be material see “other matters — critical accounting policies” 

 

the following table reflects significant reserves and valuation accounts which are estimates and based on judgments as described above at january 2 2011 and january 3 2010 in millions 

 

reserves and valuation accounts a 

 

 

 

 

  

some of the company’s products are subject to specified warranties and the company provides for the estimated cost of product warranties we regularly assess the adequacy of our preexisting warranty liabilities and adjust amounts as necessary based on a review of historic warranty experience with respect to the applicable business or products as well as the length and actual terms of the warranties which are typically one year the product warranty reserve is included in current accrued liabilities and other longterm liabilities on the balance sheet changes in the company’s product warranty reserve are as follows in millions 

 

 

 

critical accounting policies 

 

the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with united states generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the notes to the financial statements some of those judgments can be subjective and complex and therefore actual results could differ materially from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions our critical accounting policies are those that are reflective of significant judgment complexity and uncertainty and may potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions we have identified the following as critical accounting policies revenue recognition accounting for pension plans accounting for business combinations goodwill and other longlived assets and accounting for income taxes for additional discussion of the application of these and other accounting policies see note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

 

revenue recognition 

 

commercial sales and sales from us government fixedprice type contracts are generally recorded as shipments are made or as services are rendered occasionally for certain fixedprice type contracts that require substantial performance over a long time period generally one or more years revenues are recorded under the percentageofcompletion method we measure the extent of progress toward completion using the 

unitsofdelivery method costtocost method or upon attainment of scheduled performance milestones which could be time event or expense driven occasionally invoices are submitted to and paid by the customer under a contractual agreement which has a different time schedule than the related revenue recognition sales under costreimbursement contracts usually from the us government are recorded as allowable costs are incurred and fees are earned 

 

the development of cost of sales percentages used to record costs under certain fixedprice type contracts and fees under certain costreimbursement type contracts requires management’s judgment to make reasonably dependable cost estimates for the design manufacture and delivery of products and services generally over a long time period since certain fixedprice and costreimbursement type contracts extend over a long period of time the impact of revisions in cost and revenue estimates during the progress of work may adjust the current period earnings on a cumulative catchup basis this method recognizes in the current period the cumulative effect of the changes on current and prior quarters for fixedprice contracts if the current contract estimate indicates a loss a provision is made for the total anticipated loss in the period that it becomes evident contract cost and revenue estimates for significant contracts are generally reviewed and reassessed quarterly these types of contracts and estimates are most frequently related to our sales to the us government or sales to other defense contractors for ultimate sale to the us government the company follows the revenue recognition criteria under accounting standards codification “asc” 60510s991 revenue recognition for our sales to the us government in 2010 2009 and 2008 operating income as a percent of sales did not vary by more than 15 if operating income as a percent of sales to the us government had been higher or lower by 15 in 2010 the company’s operating income would have changed by approximately 129 million 

 

accounting for pension plans 

 

the company’s accounting for its defined benefit pension plan requires that amounts recognized in financial statements be determined on an actuarial basis rather than as contributions are made to the plan a significant element in determining the company’s pension income or expense is the expected return on plan assets as well as the assumed discount rate on pension liabilities the company has assumed based upon the types of securities the plan assets are invested in and the longterm historical returns of these investments that the longterm expected return on pension assets will be 825 in 2011 for its domestic pension plan and 66 for its foreign pension plan the assumed discount rate will be 59 in 2011 for its domestic pension plan and 54 for its foreign pension plan the company’s longterm expected return on pension assets used in 2010 was 825 and the assumed discount rate used in 2010 was 625 for its domestic pension plans the company’s longterm expected return on pension assets used in 2010 was 64 and the assumed discount rate used in 2010 was 56 for its foreign pension plan the actual rate of return on pension assets was123 in 2010 and 125 in 2009 for its domestic pension plans the actual rate of return on pension assets was 121 in 2010 for its foreign pension plan if the actual rate of return on pension assets is above the projection the company may be able to reduce its contributions to the pension trust if the actual rate of return on pension assets is below the projection the company may be required to make additional contributions to the pension trust the company made pretax contributions of 370 million to its pension benefit plans in 2010 and currently anticipates making an pretax cash contribution of approximately 370 million to its pension benefit plans in 2011 before recovery from the us government and expects to make an additional pretax cash contribution of 320 million provided the sale of the former aerospace engines and components segment is completed the assumed longterm rate of return on assets is applied to the marketrelated value of plan assets at the end of the previous year this produces the expected return on plan assets that is included in the annual pension income or expense calculation for the current year the cumulative difference between this expected return and the actual return on plan assets is deferred and amortized into pension income or expense over future periods at yearend 2010 the company has a 1680 million noncash reduction to stockholders’ equity and a longterm additional liability of 2766 million related to its pension plans at yearend 2009 the company had a 1602 million noncash reduction to stockholders’ equity and a longterm additional liability of 2636 million related to its pension plans see note 12 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional pension disclosures 

differences in the discount rate and expected longterm rate of return on assets within the indicated range would have had the following impact on 2010 pension expense 

 

 

 

see note 12 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional pension disclosures 

 

accounting for business combinations goodwill acquired intangible assets and other longlived assets 

 

the company accounts for goodwill and purchased intangible assets under asc 80 in all acquisitions the results are included in the company’s consolidated financial statements from the date of each respective acquisition business acquisitions are accounted for under the purchase method by assigning the purchase price to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at their fair values and the excess of the purchase price over the amounts assigned is recorded as goodwill purchased intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives adjustments to fair value assessments are recorded to goodwill over the purchase price allocation period 

 

goodwill and acquired intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized we review goodwill and acquired indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable the company also performs an annual impairment test in the fourth quarter of each year we would test goodwill for impairment between annual tests if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce our enterprise fair value below its book value these events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate including a significant sustained decline in an entity’s market value legal factors operating performance indicators competition sale or disposition of a significant portion of the business or other factors based on the annual impairment test completed in the fourth quarter of 2010 no impairment of goodwill or intangible assets with indefinite lives was indicated 

 

for goodwill impairment testing the company estimates the fair value of the reporting units using a discounted cash flow model based on our best estimate of amounts and timing of future revenues and cash flows and our most recent business and strategic plans and compares the estimated fair value to the carrying value of the reporting unit including goodwill the discounted cash flow model requires judgmental assumptions about projected revenue growth future operating margins discount rates and terminal values there are inherent uncertainties related to these assumptions and management’s judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill impairment while the company believes it has made reasonable estimates and assumptions to calculate the fair value of its reporting units it is possible a material change could occur if actual results are not consistent with management’s estimates and assumptions goodwill may be overstated and a charge would need to taken against net earnings 

 

as of january 2 2011 the company had 33 reporting units for goodwill impairment testing the carrying value of goodwill included in the company’s individual reporting units ranges from 04 million to 632 million the company’s analysis in 2010 indicated that in all instances the fair value of the company’s reporting units exceeded their carrying values and consequently did not result in an impairment charge the excess of the estimated fair value over the carrying value expressed as a percentage of carrying value of the respective reporting unit for each of the company’s reporting units as of the fourth quarter of 2010 the annual testing date ranged from approximately 20 to 1600 

 

changes in these projections could affect the estimated fair value of certain of the company’s reporting units and could result in a goodwill impairment charge in a future period in order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations used in the goodwill impairment test the company applied a hypothetical 10 

decrease to the fair values of each reporting unit and compared those values to the reporting unit carrying values based on this sensitivity analysis the company did not identify any goodwill impairment charges 

 

the impairment test for indefinitelived intangibles other than goodwill primarily trademarks and trade names consists of a comparison of the fair value of the indefinitelived intangible asset to the carrying value of the asset as of the impairment testing date the company estimates the fair value of its indefinitelived intangibles using a discounted cash flow model based on our best estimate of amounts and timing of future revenues and cash flows and our most recent business and strategic plans and compares the estimated fair value to the carrying value of the asset the estimated fair values significantly exceed the carrying value for each of the company’s indefinitelived intangible assets as of the fourth quarter of 2010 the annual testing date 

 

accounting for income taxes 

 

income tax expense and deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect management’s assessment of actual future taxes to be paid on items reflected in the financial statements significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes uncertainty exists regarding tax positions taken in previously filed tax returns still under examination and positions expected to be taken in future returns deferred tax assets and liabilities arise due to differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and tax carryforwards although we believe our income tax expense and deferred tax assets and liabilities are reasonable no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome will not be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals to the extent that the final tax outcome is different than the amounts recorded such differences will impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made the provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate as well as the related net interest 

 

significant judgment is required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets in assessing the need for a valuation allowance we consider all available evidence including past operating results estimates of future taxable income and the feasibility of tax planning strategies in the event that we change our determination as to the amount of deferred tax assets that can be realized we will adjust our valuation allowance with a corresponding impact to the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made 

 

our effective tax rates differ from the statutory rate primarily due to the tax impact of the prior year research and development tax credits state taxes and tax audit settlements the effective tax rate was 309 300 and 368 in fiscal 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively 

 

the following presents a rollforward of our unrecognized tax benefits in millions 

 

 

 

we recognized interest related to unrecognized tax benefits of 09 million and 09 million within the provision for income taxes in our statements of operations for fiscal year 2010 and 2009 respectively 

as of january 2 2011 we estimated that the entire balance of unrecognized tax benefits if resolved in our favor would positively impact the effective tax rate and therefore be recognized as additional tax benefits in our income statement 

 

we file income tax returns in the united states federal jurisdiction and in various states and foreign jurisdictions the company has substantially concluded on all us federal and california income tax matters for all years through 2006 substantially all other material state and local and foreign income tax matters have been concluded for years through 2005 

 

the company anticipates the total unrecognized tax benefit for various federal and state tax items may be reduced by 24 million due to the expiration of statutes of limitation for various federal and state tax issues in the next 12 months 

 

accounting pronouncements adopted 

 

in april 2010 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued accounting standards updates “asu” no 201017 “milestone method of revenue recognition” this asu allows entities to make a policy election to use the milestone method of revenue recognition and provides guidance on defining a milestone and the criteria that should be met for applying the milestone method the scope of this asu is limited to the transactions involving milestones relating to research and development deliverables the guidance includes enhanced disclosure requirements about each arrangement individual milestones and related contingent consideration substantive milestones and factors considered in that determination the amendments in this asu are effective prospectively to milestones achieved in fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after june 15 2010 early application and retrospective application are permitted we have evaluated this new asu and have determined that it will not have a significant impact on the determination or reporting of our financial results 

 

safe harbor cautionary statement regarding forwardlooking data 

 

this management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation contains forwardlooking statements as defined in the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 directly and indirectly relating to earnings growth opportunities product sales capital expenditures pension matters stock option compensation expense taxes and strategic plans all statements made in this management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation that are not historical in nature should be considered forwardlooking actual results could differ materially from these forwardlooking statements many factors could change the anticipated results including disruptions in the global economy changes in the insurance and credit markets changes in demand for products sold to the defense electronics instrumentation digital imaging energy exploration and production commercial aviation semiconductor and communications markets funding continuation and award of government programs continued liquidity of our suppliers and customers including commercial and aviation customers availability of credit to our suppliers and customers and a potential decrease in offshore oil production and exploration activity due to the april 2010 oil spill in the gulf of mexico increasing fuel costs could negatively affect the markets of our commercial aviation businesses lower oil and natural gas prices as well as instability in the middle east or other oil producing regions could negatively affect our businesses that supply the oil and gas industry in addition financial market fluctuations affect the value of our pension assets 

 

global responses to terrorism and other perceived threats increase uncertainties associated with forwardlooking statements about our businesses various responses to terrorism and perceived threats could realign government programs and affect the composition funding or timing of our programs changes in the policies of us and foreign governments could result over time in reductions and realignment in defense or other government spending and further changes in programs in which the company participates including anticipated reductions in the company’s missile defense engineering services and nasa programs 

 

the company continues to take action to assure compliance with the internal controls disclosure controls and other requirements of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 while we believe our control systems are effective 

there are inherent limitations in all control systems and misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and may not be detected 

 

while teledyne’s growth strategy includes possible acquisitions we cannot provide any assurance as to when if or on what terms any acquisitions will be made acquisitions involve various inherent risks such as among others our ability to integrate acquired businesses retain customers and achieve identified financial and operating synergies there are additional risks associated with acquiring owning and operating businesses outside of the united states including those arising from us and foreign government policy changes or actions and exchange rate fluctuations 

 

anticipated benefits of the recent dalsa acquisition are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties including teledyne’s ability to integrate the acquired operations retain customers and achieve operating synergies the ability of dalsa to develop and market new products the operating results of dalsa being lower than anticipated and unexpected acquisitionrelated costs and expenses 

 

with the recently completed acquisition of dalsa and upon completion of the pending divestiture of our piston engines businesses which is subject to closing conditions the company’s risk profile will change and may differ materially from prior years 

 

additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in the forwardlooking statements is contained beginning on page 18 of this form 10k under the caption “risk factors cautionary statements as to forwardlooking statements” forwardlooking statements are generally accompanied by words such as “estimate” “project” “predict” “believes” or “expect” that convey the uncertainty of future events or outcomes we assume no obligation to publicly update or revise any forwardlooking statements whether as a result of new information or otherwise

customers 

 

we have hundreds of customers in the electronics communications aerospace and defense industries no commercial customer accounted for more than 10 of our total sales during 2009 2008 or 2007 

 

approximately 44 40 and 41 of our total sales for 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively were derived from contracts with agencies of and prime contractors to the us government our principal us government customer is the us department of defense these sales represented 34 29 and 30 of our total sales for 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively in 2009 2008 and 2007 our largest program with the us government was the systems engineering and technical assistance contract with the space and missile defense command and 

it represented 38 35 and 43 of total sales respectively set forth below are sales by our segments to agencies and prime contractors to the us government for the periods presented 

 

us government sales 

 

 

 

as described on pages 18 through 21 there are risks associated with doing business with the us government in 2009 approximately 50 of our us government prime contracts and subcontracts were fixedprice type contracts compared to 48 in 2008 and 42 in 2007 under these types of contracts we bear the inherent risk that actual performance cost may exceed the fixed contract price such contracts are typically not subject to renegotiation of profits if we fail to anticipate technical problems estimate costs accurately or control costs during performance additionally us government contracts are subject to termination by the us government at its convenience without identification of any default when contracts are terminated for convenience we typically recover costs incurred or committed settlement expenses and profit on work completed prior to termination we had seven us government contracts terminated for convenience in 2009 compared to five in 2008 and four in 2007 

 

our total backlog of confirmed orders was approximately 8310 million at january 3 2010 8428 million at december 28 2008 and 7072 million at december 30 2007 we expect to fulfill 98 of such backlog of confirmed orders during 2010 

 

sales to international customers accounted for approximately 26 of total sales in 2009 compared with 24 in 2008 and 22 in 2007 in 2009 we sold products to customers in over 100 foreign countries approximately 90 percent of our sales to foreign customers were made to customers in 28 foreign countries the 2009 top five countries for international sales which included the united kingdom norway germany japan and canada constituted approximately 129 of our total sales 

 

sales and marketing 

 

our sales and marketing approach varies by segment and by products within our segments a shared fundamental tenet is the commitment to work closely with our customers to understand their needs with an aim to secure preferred supplier and longerterm relationships 

 

our business segments use a combination of internal sales forces distributors and commissioned sales representatives to market and sell our products and services as part of ongoing acquisition integration efforts some of our teledyne instruments companies and other business units have been working to consolidate or share internal sales and servicing efforts several teledyne businesses have begun marketing and selling products collaboratively to similar customers to promote “onestop” shopping under singular “brand” names including teledyne oil  gas teledyne marine teledyne nuclear and teledyne water quality 

 

products are also advertised in appropriate trade journals and by means of various websites to promote our products and other capabilities our personnel regularly participate in relevant trade shows and professional associations 

 

many of our government contracts are awarded after a competitive bidding process in which we seek to emphasize our ability to provide superior products and technical solutions in addition to competitive pricing 

 

through teledyne technologies international corp and other subsidiaries the company has established offices in foreign countries to facilitate international sales for various businesses 

competition 

 

we believe that technological capabilities and innovation and the ability to invest in the development of new and enhanced products are critical to obtaining and maintaining leadership in our markets and the industries in which we compete although we have certain advantages that we believe help us compete effectively in our markets each of our markets is highly competitive our businesses vigorously compete on the basis of quality product performance and reliability technical expertise price and service many of our competitors have and potential competitors could have greater name recognition a larger installed base of products more extensive engineering manufacturing marketing and distribution capabilities and greater financial technological and personnel resources than we do 

 

research and development 

 

our research and development efforts primarily involve engineering and design related to improving product lines and developing new products and technologies in the same or similar fields we spent a total of 3769 million in 2009 3958 million in 2008 and 3551 million in 2007 on research and development and bid and proposal costs customerfunded research and development most of which was attributable to work under contracts with the us government represented approximately 84 of total research and development costs for 2009 compared to 83 in each of 2008 and 2007 

 

in 2009 approximately 83 of the 608 million in companyfunded research and development and bid and proposal costs were incurred in our electronics and communications businesses we expect the level of companyfunded research and development and bid and proposal costs to be approximately 655 million in 2010 

 

intellectual property 

 

while we own and control various intellectual property rights including patents trade secrets confidential information trademarks trade names and copyrights which in the aggregate are of material importance to our business we believe that our business as a whole is not materially dependent upon any one intellectual property or related group of such properties we own several hundred active patents and are licensed to use certain patents technology and other intellectual property rights owned and controlled by others similarly other companies are licensed to use certain patents technology and other intellectual property rights owned and controlled by us 

 

patents patent applications and license agreements will expire or terminate over time by operation of law in accordance with their terms or otherwise we do not expect the expiration or termination of these patents patent applications and license agreements to have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

 

employees 

 

our total current workforce consists of approximately 8100 employees the international union of united automobile aerospace and agricultural implement workers of america represents approximately 270 active employees at our teledyne continental motors piston engine manufacturing facility in mobile alabama under a collective bargaining agreement that expired by its terms on february 20 2010 but continues under a temporary renewal as negotiations continue this union also represents approximately 10 active employees at the teledyne turbine engines facility in toledo ohio under a collective bargaining agreement that expired on november 10 2009 while employees continue to work and labor negotiations are occurring under both agreements there is no assurance that a strike or work stoppage may not occur overall we consider our relations with our employees to be good

 item 1 a risk factors tableend  

risk factors cautionary statement as to forwardlooking statements 

 

the following text highlights various risks and uncertainties associated with teledyne these factors could materially affect “forwardlooking statements” within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 that we may from time to time make including forwardlooking statements contained in “item 1 business” and “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” of this form 10k and in teledyne’s 2009 annual report to stockholders it is not possible for management to predict all such factors and new factors may emerge additionally management cannot assess the impact of each such factor on teledyne or the extent to which any factor or combination of factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forwardlooking statements 

continuing disruptions in the global economy the financial markets the currency markets and the energy markets as well as government responses to these disruptions may adversely impact our business and results of operations 

 

continuing distress in the financial markets has had an adverse impact on the availability of credit and liquidity resources we do not believe however that any lender commitments under our current 590 million credit facility which expires in july 2011 have been adversely affected continued market deterioration nonetheless could jeopardize certain counterparty obligations including those of the insurers and financial institutions with which we do business some of our customers may face issues gaining access to sufficient credit which could result in an impairment of their ability to make timely payments to us or a determination to cancel delay or otherwise not purchase our products due to reduced credit availability many of our marine survey customers are continuing to delay the building of new exploration vessels and to reduce maintenance expenditures on their existing fleets such delays continue to adversely affect sales of our geophysical streamer cables and hydrophones lack of availability of consumer credit and the general economic downturn have adversely impacted the market for general aviation aircraft which generally means lower sales of piston engines and related components by us some of our suppliers may also continue to face issues gaining access to sufficient credit to maintain their businesses which could reduce the availability of some components and to the extent such suppliers are single source suppliers could adversely affect our ability to continue to manufacture and sell our products additionally there have been fluctuations in currency markets to the extent the us dollar becomes stronger relative to many other major currencies our products priced in us dollars may be more expensive relative to products of our foreign competitors which could result in lower sales further the nondollar denominated earnings of our foreign operations may be lower when reported by us in us dollars a slowdown in economic activity caused by a continuing recession would likely reduce worldwide demand for energy and result in lower oil and natural gas prices which could result in lower sales at our business units that supply the oil and gas industry conversely disruptions that increase the price of oil and gas could negatively affect market demand for products that we sell to general and commercial aircraft markets government responses to these market disruptions have signaled reductions in and could further reduce spending for defense programs and other government programs in which we participate 

 

we sell products and services to customers in industries that are cyclical and sensitive to changes in general economic activity 

 

we develop and manufacture products for customers in the energy exploration and production markets each of which has been cyclical and suffered from fluctuating market demands strong demand and increased prices for oil and natural gas historically has contributed to substantial revenue growth at teledyne geophysical instruments teledyne odi and our other marine businesses a cyclical downturn in these markets may materially affect future operating results particularly given our broader range of marine instrumentation businesses acquired since 2003 

 

domestic and international commercial aerospace markets are cyclical in nature historic demand for new commercial aircraft has been related to the stability and health of domestic and international economies as a result of economic conditions and significant tightening of the credit markets it may continue to be difficult for the commercial airlines and aircraft leasing companies to obtain credit to buy new airplanes delays or changes in aircraft and component orders could impact the future demand for our teledyne controls and other products and have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

 

many of the oem customers of our aerospace engines and components segment are privatelyheld and may not be wellcapitalized over the last several years a few airline manufacturer customers of teledyne continental motors have filed for bankruptcy protection for example in 2007 one such bankruptcy resulted in a 17 million writeoff of our related accounts receivable besides writeoffs we may have to pay back amounts received shortly before a customer’s filing of bankruptcy due to purported preferential timing of payments received fortunately such deemed preferential payments have been relatively small while teledyne continental motors tries to monitor its customers’ payment streams and financial wherewithal and avail itself of available prebankruptcy protections among other things such actions may only mitigate losses not prevent them any future credit problems with our customers could result in similar or larger writeoffs or 

reimbursements and have a material adverse effect on the business results of operations and financial condition of our aerospace engines and components segment 

 

some of our businesses are also suppliers to the semiconductor industry which is highly cyclical by nature the semiconductor industry has experienced significant and sometimes prolonged downturns any downturn in the semiconductor industry or any other industry that uses a significant number of semiconductor devices such as consumer electronic products telecommunication devices or computing devices could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results 

 

in addition we sell products and services to customers in industries that are sensitive to the level of general economic activity and consumer spending habits and in more mature industries that are sensitive to capacity adverse economic conditions affecting these industries may reduce demand for our products and services which may reduce our profits or our production levels or both some of our businesses serve industries such as power generation and petrochemical refining which may be negatively impacted by reductions in global capital expenditures and manufacturing capacity 

 

our dependence on revenue from government contracts subjects us to many risks 

 

our revenue from government contracts depends on the continued availability of funding from the us government and accordingly we have the risk that funding for our existing contracts may be canceled or diverted to other uses or delayed 

 

we perform work on a number of contracts with the department of defense and other agencies and departments of the us government including subcontracts with government prime contractors sales under contracts with the us government as a whole including sales under contracts with the department of defense as prime contractor or subcontractor represented approximately 44 of our total revenue in 2009 as compared with 40 in 2008 and 41 in 2007 performance under government contracts has certain inherent risks that could have a material effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

 

government contracts are conditioned upon the continuing availability of congressional appropriations congress typically appropriates funds for a given program on a fiscalyear basis even though contract performance may take more than one year as a result at the beginning of a major program a contract is typically only partially funded and additional funding is normally committed to the contract by the procuring agency only as congress makes appropriations available for future fiscal years the timing of program cycles can also affect our results of operations for a particular quarter or year it is not uncommon for the department of defense to delay the timing of awards for major programs for six to twelve months or more beyond the original projected timeframe 

 

while us defense spending increased as a result of the september 11th terrorist attacks and the war in iraq it is currently expected to moderate and then decline over the next few years the continued war on terrorism and the iraq and afghanistan wars could result in a diversion of funds from programs in which teledyne participates in addition continued defense spending does not necessarily correlate to continued business for us because not all of the programs in which we participate or have current capabilities may be provided with continued funding 

 

changes in policy and budget priorities by the president his administration and our congress for various defense and nasa programs could continue to impact our engineered systems and energy and power systems segments for example changes in national space policy that affect nasa’s budget are likely there have already been significant reductions in missile defense budgets and we anticipate continuing scrutiny of those budgets to impact our revenues our energy and power systems segment may be further impacted by delays in production funding on the joint air to surface standoff missile “jassm” program in addition reductions and delays in research and development funding by the us government may continue to impact our revenues as the new director of the defense advanced research projects agency referred to as darpa reviews its programs aimed to enhance technologically us military capabilities and national security changes to the darpa research and technology development programs in which we participate could occur 

our electronics and communications segment provides a variety of products for several military platforms including the f35 joint strike fighter development and production of this aircraft is very expensive and there is no guarantee that the department of defense as it balances budget priorities will continue to provide funding to manufacture and support the f35 aircraft or other platforms for which we provide products in january 2010 delays in the f35 program were signaled in 2009 congress had made the decision to curtail f22a aircraft funding reallocation of funding priorities within the department of defense could also affect repair and spares sales for older military platforms including by way of example sales of our traveling wave tubes for f15 f16 f18 ea6b b52 b1 c130 and u2 aircraft 

 

our participation in government programs may decrease or be subject to renegotiation as those programs evolve over time 

 

the relocation to huntsville alabama of the missile defense agency or mda has resulted in the transfer to the mda of certain missions and functions from the us army space and missile defense command or smdc new leadership at the mda is conducting solicitations that could impact support by our engineered systems segment to the agency for example all mda government engineering support services work is now to be recompeted at the conclusion of each existing contract and several major prime contracts under which we perform such services are nearing the end of their respective periods of performance 

 

the us government has also placed emphasis on organizational conflict of interest or oci as a result requests for proposals in the areas of engineering support testing and operational analysis are restricting bidders from related development and integration work this may require some business units or subsidiaries of teledyne to abstain or withdraw from contract competition if other teledyne businesses may be affected by an oci in particular the mda is reconsidering its policy on oci it is reviewing all oci mitigation plans and may require more rigid mitigatory conditions going forward potentially limiting our participation in certain major mda programs such as groundbased midcourse defense 

 

the us government has been placing emphasis on small business quotas and increasing small business contract set asides and minimum work percentages in some cases prime contractors are required to reduce large subcontractor participation in order to fill small business quotas and be responsive to proposals and bids additionally the general accounting office or gao has issued rulings which favor the interests of small businesses under multiple award indefinite deliveryindefinite quantity or idiq contracts several of the contracts under which we perform engineering support services for mda are of this type and as a result our engineering services business could be significantly impacted 

 

over time and for a variety of reasons programs can evolve and affect the extent of our participation for example teledyne brown engineering inc’s groundbased midcourse defense “gmd” program has been negatively impacted by both the nominal end date of development activity and the change in focus of the current administration relative to missile defense teledyne brown engineering’s revenues for the gmd program declined from approximately 45 million in 2007 to 43 million in 2008 to 31 million in 2009 in 2010 and 2011 revenues from the gmd program are expected to decrease below 20 million per year as the us government’s priorities for missile defense move toward regional defense architectures to defeat short and midrange threats although teledyne brown engineering remains a major subcontractor on the gmd program future growth opportunities revolve around mda’s conduct of ground and flight test activities in 2011 and beyond and there is uncertainty regarding these activities 

 

we have been a significant participant in nasa programs primarily through our engineered systems segment and through teledyne scientific company our current nasa activities focus on the international space station and the james webb space telescope as nasa approaches completion of the international space station and retirement of the space shuttle our engineered systems segment has moved away from its historical role in scientific payload development and integration and toward supporting nasa with concept development engineering services and prototype development for the new ares crew launch vehicles for space exploration the president his administration and congress have been leaning towards shifting funding away from exploration toward other priorities such as earth science and aeronautics such policy and priority changes would likely negatively impact our business 

we may not be successful in bidding for future contracts which would reduce our revenues or slow our growth 

 

we obtain many us government prime contracts and subcontracts through the process of competitive bidding we may not be successful in having our bids awarded in addition we may spend substantial amounts of time money and effort including design development and marketing activities required to prepare bids and proposals for contracts that may not be awarded to us in 2009 we incurred 139 million on bid and proposals costs compared with 138 million in 2008 and 122 million in 2007 

 

our contracts with the us government are subject to termination rights that could adversely affect us 

 

most of our us government contracts are subject to termination by the us government either at its convenience or upon the default of the contractor even when not expressly included in a us government contract courts have validated termination for convenience as a matter of public procurement policy termination for convenience provisions provide only for the recovery of costs incurred or committed settlement expenses and profit on work completed prior to termination termination for default clauses impose liability on the contractor for excess costs incurred by the us government in reprocuring undelivered items from another source during 2009 teledyne had seven us government contracts terminated for convenience all of which were in our electronics  communications segment we did not have any of our us government contracts terminated for default during 2009 

 

we may lose money or generate less than expected profits on our fixedprice government contracts and we may lose money if we fail to meet certain prespecified targets in government contracts 

 

there is no guarantee that us government contracts will be profitable a number of our us government prime contracts and subcontracts are fixedprice type contracts 50 of our total us government contracts in 2009 48 in 2008 and 42 in 2007 under these types of contracts we bear the inherent risk that actual performance cost may exceed the fixed contract price this is particularly true when the contract is awarded and the price finalized in advance of final completion of design under such contracts we must absorb cost overruns notwithstanding the difficulty of estimating all of the costs we will incur in performing these contracts our failure to anticipate technical problems estimate costs accurately or control costs during performance of a fixedprice contract may reduce profitability or cause a loss we have also experienced some volatility in the pricing of certain raw materials and components underlying our fixedprice contracts such contracts are typically not subject to renegotiation of profits if we fail to anticipate technical problems estimate costs accurately or control costs during performance we cannot assure that our contract loss provisions in our financial statements will be adequate to cover all actual future losses we may lose money on some contracts if we fail to meet these estimates 

 

certain fees under some of our us government contracts are linked to meeting specified technical cost andor schedule targets including development or testing deadlines fees may also be influenced or be dependent on the collective efforts and success of other defense contractors over which we had no or limited control 

 

our business is subject to government contracting regulations and our failure to comply with such laws and regulations could harm our operating results and prospects 

 

we like other government contractors are subject to various audits reviews and investigations including private party “whistleblower” lawsuits relating to our compliance with federal and state laws generally claims arising out of these us government inquiries and voluntary disclosures can be resolved without resorting to litigation however should the business unit or division involved be charged with wrongdoing or should the us government determine that the business unit or division is not a “presently responsible contractor” that business unit or division and conceivably our company as a whole could be temporarily suspended or in the event of a conviction could be debarred for up to three years from receiving new government contracts or governmentapproved subcontracts in addition we could expend substantial amounts 

defending against such charges and in damages fines and penalties if such charges were proven or were to result in negotiated settlements 

 

united states and global responses to terrorism the iraq and afghanistan wars mexican border town violence nuclear proliferation concerns and potential epidemics increase uncertainties with respect to many of our businesses and may adversely affect our business and results of operations 

 

united states’ and global responses to terrorism the iraq and afghanistan wars mexican border town violence and nuclear proliferation concerns increase uncertainties with respect to us and other business and financial markets several factors associated directly or indirectly with terrorism the iraq and afghanistan situations and perceived nuclear threats and responses may adversely affect us the reaction to iran’s continuing desire to explore nuclear capabilities could adversely affect oil prices and some of our businesses 

 

while some of our businesses that provide products or services to the us government experienced greater demand as a result of increased us government defense spending various responses could realign government programs and affect the composition funding or timing of our government programs the president his administration and congress could also further alter government programs government spending could shift to the department of defense or homeland security programs in which we may not participate or may not have current capabilities these decisions could curtail less pressing nondefense programs in which we do participate including department of energy or nasa programs government spending could also shift towards nondefense programs in which we do not currently participate 

 

air travel declines have occurred after terrorist attacks and heightened security alerts as well as after the h1n1 virus sars and bird flu scares additional declines in air travel resulting from such factors and other factors could adversely affect the financial condition of many of our commercial airline and aircraft manufacturer customers and in turn could adversely affect our electronics and communications segment in addition a prolonged virus epidemic or pandemic or the threat thereof could result in worker absences lower productivity voluntary closure of our offices and manufacturing facilities disruptions in our supply chain travel restrictions on our employees and other disruptions to our businesses moreover health epidemics may force local health and government authorities to mandate the temporary closure of our offices and manufacturing facilities as was done with our mexico operations in 2009 

 

deterioration of financial performance of airlines could result in a reduction of discretionary spending for upgrades of avionics and inflight communications equipment which would adversely affect our electronics and communications segment 

 

the us government continues to evaluate potential security issues associated with general aviation increased government regulations including but not limited to increased airspace regulations including user fees could lead to an overall decline in air travel and have an adverse affect on our aerospace engines and components and energy and power systems segments as happened after the september 11th terrorist attacks reinstatement of flight restrictions would negatively impact the market for general aviation aircraft piston engines and components of our aerospace engines and components segment and associated products of teledyne battery products potential reductions in the need for general aviation aircraft maintenance as a result of declines in air travel could also adversely affect our aerospace engines and components segment 

 

higher oil prices could reduce general aviation air travel negatively affecting our aerospace engines and components segment higher oil prices could also adversely affect commercial airlinerelated customers of our electronics and communications segment conversely lower oil prices could decrease oil exploration and petrochemical refining activities and hinder our marine and other instrumentation businesses including teledyne geophysical instruments teledyne tss limited teledyne benthos inc teledyne dg o’brien and teledyne odi inc as well as some of our other businesses such as teledyne storm products inc in addition instability in the middle east or other oilproducing regions could adversely affect expansion plans of the oil and gas industry customers of our instrumentation and cable solutions businesses 

 

violence and crime in mexico particularly in border towns where we conduct some manufacturing activities could adversely affect our relays and cable solutions businesses 

acquisitions involve inherent risks that may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

 

our growth strategy includes acquisitions acquisitions involve various inherent risks such as 

 

  

while we conduct financial and other due diligence in connection with our acquisitions and generally seek some form of protection including indemnification from a seller and sometimes an escrow of a portion of the purchase price to cover potential issues such acquired companies may have weaknesses or liabilities that are not accurately assessed or brought to our attention at the time of the acquisition further indemnities or escrows may not fully cover such matters particularly matters identified after a closing 

 

we have also acquired several private companies including the 2008 acquisitions of cormon limited and odom hydrographic systems inc and the assets of webb research corp and demo systems llc private companies generally do not have as formal or comprehensive internal controls and compliance systems in place as public companies while we have required various sellers to take certain compliance actions prior to the closing of an acquisition including making voluntary disclosures under various export control laws and regulations and have sought protections in the purchase agreement for such matters there is no assurance that we have identified all issues or will be fully protected from historic liabilities after acquiring a company notwithstanding preclosing due diligence we have discovered issues that required further action including making voluntary disclosures under various defense and export control laws and regulations 

 

while the products and customer base of the companies we have acquired over the years are complementary to some of teledyne’s existing businesses there is no assurance that we will achieve all identified financial operating and marketing synergies we may also experience problems that arise in entering new markets through acquisitions in which we may have little or no experience 

 

additionally in 2008 we expanded our united kingdom presence with the acquisitions of tss international limited filtronic defence limited and cormon limited during 2009 our united kingdom operations accounted for 5 of total revenues compared with 3 in 2008 and 2 in 2007 there are additional risks associated with owning and operating businesses internationally including those arising from us and foreign government policy changes or actions and exchange rate fluctuations with a general election to occur in the united kingdom in may 2010 there may be changes to its government policies further it has been postulated that the united kingdom economy may recover more slowly to the global economic crisis than the united states and mainland europe 

 

in connection with acquisitions we may consolidate one or more acquired facilities with other teledyne facilities to obtain synergies and costsavings for example in 2009 we consolidated the 2008acquired moorpark cabased operations and assets of demo systems llc principally with teledyne controls el segundo ca we also combined and relocated with minimal disruption the operations of the 2008acquired teledyne impulse and longtime owned teledyne interconnect devices to a new leased facility in san diego ca in addition in 2009 we relocated the principal operations of both 2008acquired teledyne tss limited and teledyne cormon limited to more modern and larger facilities close to their prior locations nonetheless 

despite planning relocation and consolidation of manufacturing operations has inherent risks as it tends to involve among other things change of personnel application of a new business system software and learning or adaptation of manufacturing processes and techniques as a result production delays at a new operating location may occur 

 

under sec rules teledyne must issue a report on management’s assessment of the effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting the sec permits a limited timebased exclusion for acquisitions to give a company an opportunity to evaluate more fully the internal controls of acquired companies and correct deficiencies and institute new or additional internal controls our 2008 management’s report specifically excluded from its scope and coverage our 2008 acquisitions of filtronic defence limited cormon limited and odom hydrographic systems inc and the assets of webb research corp and demo systems llc allowing us additional time to evaluate existing internal controls and implement additional controls as appropriate these acquisitions are now included in our 2009 management’s report at page 39 with regard to future acquisitions we can provide no assurance that we will be able to provide a report that contains no significant deficiencies or material weaknesses with respect to these acquired companies or other acquisitions 

 

in connection with our acquisitions including ones which we do not complete we may incur significant transaction costs we are required to expense as incurred such transaction costs which may have an adverse impact on our quarterly financial results 

 

product liability claims product recalls and field service actions could have a material adverse effect on our reputation business results of operations and financial condition 

 

as a manufacturer and distributor of a wide variety of products including aircraft engines monitoring instruments and medical devices our results of operations are susceptible to adverse publicity regarding the quality or safety of our products in part product liability claims challenging the safety of our products may result in a decline in sales for a particular product which could adversely affect our results of operations this could be the case even if the claims themselves are proven untrue or settled for immaterial amounts 

 

while we have general liability and other insurance policies concerning product liabilities we have selfinsured retentions or deductibles under such policies with respect to a portion of these liabilities for example our current annual selfinsured retention for general aviation aircraft liabilities incurred in connection with products manufactured by teledyne continental motors inc is approximately 172 million a decrease from 201 million for the prior annual period our existing aircraft product liability insurance policy expires on may 31 2010 additionally based on facts and circumstances of claims we have not always accrued amounts up to the applicable annual selfinsured retentions awarded damages could be more than our accruals we could incur losses above the aggregate annual policy limit as well 

 

product recalls can be expensive and tarnish our reputation and have a material adverse effect on the sales of our products in february 2009 teledyne continental motors commenced a voluntary recall of certain aircraft piston engine cylinders produced since november 2007 we recorded a pretax charge of 180 million during the fourth quarter of 2008 to cover estimated costs related to the recall and replacement of affected cylinders subsequently in october 2009 teledyne continental motors learned of another product issue with certain aircraft piston engine valve lifters produced by a supplier that caused the grounding of a limited number of aircraft for inspection and replacement of the valve lifters during the fourth quarter of 2009 we recorded a pretax charge of 28 million to cover estimated costs related to the recall and replacement of the affected lifters in the second quarter of 2009 teledyne energy systems inc recorded a 12 million product replacement reserve for certain commercial energy systems 

 

we have developed electronic controls known as powerlink fadec for piston aircraft engines that automate many functions requiring manual control such as fuel flow and power management while such control systems should improve engine management and facilitate maintenance of engines we could face additional claims as they become standard equipment on selected new piston engine aircraft or are retrofitted on some piston engine aircraft new products can trigger additional product liability claims as such products are further tested by actual usage additionally general aviation aircraft crash lawsuits tend to name as defendants manufacturers of a multitude of aircraftrelated products as discovery and recoveries are pursued 

we have been joined among a number of defendants often over 100 in lawsuits alleging injury or death as a result of exposure to asbestos we have not incurred material liabilities in connection with these lawsuits the filings typically do not identify any of our products as a source of asbestos exposure and we have been dismissed from cases for lack of product identification but only after some defense costs have been incurred also because of the prominent “teledyne” name we may be mistakenly joined in lawsuits involving a company or business that was not assumed by us as part of our 1999 spinoff our historic insurance coverage including that of its predecessors may not fully cover such claims and the defense of such matters coverage typically depends on the year of purported exposure and other factors nonetheless we intend to defend these claims vigorously congress from time to time has considered tort reform to deal with asbestosrelated claims but to date nothing has materialized 

 

certain gas generators manufactured by teledyne energy systems inc contain a sealed wetted asbestos component while the company has been transitioning to a replacement material has placed warning labels on its products and takes care in handling of this material by employees there is no assurance that the company will not face product liability or workers compensation claims involving this component 

 

our teledyne brown engineering’s laboratory in knoxville tennessee performs radiological analyses while the laboratory is certified by the department of energy and the nuclear procurement issues committee also known as nupic and has other nuclearrelated certifications and internal quality controls in place errors and omissions in analyses may occur we currently have errors and omissions insurance coverage and nuclear liability insurance coverage that might apply depending on the circumstances we also have sought indemnities from some of our customers our insurance coverage or indemnities however may not be adequate to cover potential problems associated with faulty radiological analyses 

 

we cannot assure that we will not have additional product liability claims or that we will not recall any additional products 

 

we may have difficulty obtaining product liability and other insurance coverages or be subject to increased costs for such coverage 

 

as a manufacturer of a variety of products including aircraft engines used in general aviation aircraft we have general liability and other insurance policies that provide coverage beyond selfinsured retentions or deductibles we cannot assure that for 2010 and in future years insurance carriers will be willing to renew coverage or provide new coverage for product liability especially as it relates to general aviation over the last several years the number of insurance companies providing general aviation product liability insurance coverage has decreased even if such insurance is available we may be required to pay substantially higher prices for coverage andor increase our levels of selfinsured retentions or reserves our current aircraft product liability insurance policy expires in may 2010 and has an annual selfinsured retention of approximately 172 million 

 

to offset aircraft product liability insurance costs we continue to work to reduce manufacturing and other costs and also to pass on such insurance costs through price increases on our aircraft engines and spare parts we cannot provide assurances that further cost reduction efforts will prove successful or that customers will accept additional price increases aircraft engines and spare part cost increases coupled with increased costs of insurance for general aviation aircraft owners tend to result in decreasing aftermarket sales of our piston engines and component parts this in turn leaves our aerospace engines and components segment more dependent on sales to oems which is more dependent on general economic conditions 

 

for certain electronic components for medical applications that we manufacture such as those that go into cardiac defibrillators we have asked for indemnities from our customers andor to be included under their insurance policies we cannot however provide any assurance that such indemnities or insurance will offset potential liabilities that we may incur as a result of our manufacture of such components additionally while we have been exiting the manufacture of some medical components claims may still arise after such manufacturing ceases 

 

aside from the uncertainties created by external events that can affect insurance coverages such as the currently unexplained crash of air france flight 447 in the atlantic ocean in june 2009 the american 

international group inc 2008 failure and bailout the devastating 2005 hurricane season or september 11th events our ability to obtain product liability insurance and the cost for such insurance are affected by our historical claims experience while we have taken steps to improve our claims management process over the last few years we cannot assure that for 2010 and in future years our ability to obtain insurance or the cost for such insurance or the amount of selfinsured retentions reserves or limits will not be negatively impacted by our experience in prior years 

 

our pension expenses and the value of our pension assets are affected by factors outside of our control including the performance of plan assets the stock market interest rates and actuarial data 

 

we have a defined benefit pension plan covering most of our employees hired prior to 2004 the value of the combined pension assets is currently less than our accumulated pension benefit obligation given our pension plan’s underfunded status in 2004 we began making required cash contributions to our qualified pension plan in 2009 given the market conditions and the reduction in pension asset values we made pretax cash contributions totaling 1170 million all of which was beyond what was required under erisa for 2008 and 2007 pretax cash contributions totaled 587 million and 75 million respectively the lower contribution level in 2007 is primarily due to the merger into our qualified pension plan of the overfunded qualified rockwell scientific company llc pension plan which was part of our september 2006 acquisition of rockwell scientific company in 2010 we currently expect to make pretax voluntary cash contributions totaling 370 million the accounting rules applicable to our qualified pension plan require that amounts recognized in the financial statements be determined on an actuarial basis rather than as contributions are made to the plan two significant elements in determining our pension income or pension expense are the expected return on plan assets and the discount rate used in projecting pension benefit obligations declines in the stock market and lower rates of return could increase required contributions to our qualified pension plan any decreases or increases in market interest rates will affect the discount rate assumption used in projecting pension benefit obligations if and to the extent decreases are not offset by voluntary contributions or asset returns our required cash contributions and pension expense could increase under the plans for additional discussion of pension matters see the discussion under “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition” and notes 2 and 12 to notes to consolidated financial statements at the end of 2007 we changed some investment allocations to reduce exposure to deterioration in the subprime mortgage market throughout 2008 and until the latter part of 2009 given market disruptions and volatility we maintained a greater amount in fixed income investments including in us treasury notes to achieve greater stability in our pension assets during the second half of 2009 we began to change our investment strategy to more active management and increase our equity investments due to timing of investment allocation changes we may not have benefited from some upswings in certain investments and in the future we may not benefit from any such upswings to the extent we change investment allocations to meet our current strategy additionally our investment strategy may not be successful if the credit financial or stock markets deteriorate 

 

our future financial results could be adversely impacted by asset impairment charges 

 

under current accounting guidance we are required to test annually both acquired goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment based upon a fair value approach rather than amortizing them over time we have chosen to perform our annual impairment reviews of goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year we also are required to test goodwill for impairment between annual tests if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce our enterprise fair value below its book value these events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate including a significant sustained decline in an entity’s market value legal factors operating performance indicators competition sale or disposition of a significant portion of the business or other factors if the fair market value is less than the book value of goodwill we could be required to record an impairment charge the valuation of reporting units requires judgment in estimating future cash flows discount rates and estimated product life cycles in making these judgments we evaluate the financial health of the business including such factors as industry performance changes in technology and operating cash flows as we have grown through acquisitions we have accumulated 5024 million of 

goodwill and have 1096 million of net acquired intangible assets which includes 353 million of indefinitelived intangible assets out of total assets of 14215 million at january 3 2010 as a result the amount of any annual or interim impairment could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our reported financial results for the period in which the charge is taken we also may be required to record an earnings charge or incur unanticipated expenses if as a result of a change in strategy or other reason we were to determine the value of other assets had been impaired 

 

generally accepted accounting principles require that a longlived asset to be disposed of be reported at the lower of its carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell an asset other than goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets is considered impaired when estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset in the event the carrying amount of such asset is not deemed recoverable the asset is adjusted to its estimated fair value fair value is generally determined based upon estimated discounted future cash flows 

 

we may not have sufficient resources to fund all future research and development and capital expenditures or possible acquisitions 

 

in order to remain competitive we must make a substantial investment in research and development of new or enhanced products and continuously upgrade our process technology and manufacturing capabilities in september 2006 we acquired rockwell scientific company llc a provider of research and development services primarily in the areas of electronics optics information sciences and materials technologies with teledyne scientific company in our portfolio we have been more actively promoting and funding joint research and development projects with other teledyne businesses including teledyne brown engineering inc teledyne reynolds inc and our teledyne oil  gas businesses in 2009 we funded 469 million for research and development compared to 519 million in 2008 and 475 million in 2007 our capital expenditures totaled 362 million in 2009 419 million in 2008 and 403 million in 2007 although we believe that anticipated cash flows from operations and available borrowings under our 5900 million credit facility will be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated working capital research and development and capital investment needs we may be unable to fund all of these needs or possible acquisitions our ability to raise additional capital will depend on a variety of factors some of which will not be within our control including the existence of a public offering market investor perceptions of us our businesses and the industries in which we operate and general economic conditions we may be unable to successfully raise additional capital if needed failure to successfully raise needed capital on a timely or costeffective basis could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

 

our indebtedness could materially and adversely affect our business 

 

as of january 3 2010 we had 2521 million in total outstanding indebtedness including 2400 million under our 5900 million credit facility on february 26 2010 we had 2400 million outstanding under our 5900 million credit facility our indebtedness could harm our business by among other things reducing the funds available to make new strategic acquisitions our indebtedness could also have a material adverse effect on our business by increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions or a downturn in our business general adverse economic and industry conditions or a downturn in our business could result in our inability to repay this indebtedness in a timely manner in addition although our 5900 million credit facility does not terminate until july 2011 we are planning to refinance such credit facility prior to its scheduled maturity we expect that interest rates will be higher under any new or renewed facility due to changes in market conditions since our last credit facility was put in place a 100 basis point increase in interest rates would result in an annual interest expense of approximately 24 million assuming the 2400 million in debt were outstanding for the full year at this time there also can be no assurance that banks would be willing to maintain such a credit limit or otherwise lend to us on the same favorable terms such limit and terms of borrowing are dependent on many factors including financial market and economic conditions as well as the composition of the bank lending group we may also elect to raise other forms of debt capital depending on financial market and economic conditions 

we may be unsuccessful in our efforts to increase our participation in certain new markets 

 

we intend to both adapt our existing technologies and develop new products to expand into new market segments we have been developing new electronic products including highpower solid state microwave devices and tactical military camera systems which are intended to access markets in which teledyne does not currently participate or has limited participation we may be unsuccessful in accessing these and other new markets if our products do not meet our customers’ requirements as a result of changes in either technology and industry standards or because of actions taken by our competitors 

 

limitations in customer funding for applied research and development and technology insertion projects due to the present economic downturn and the significant expenditures in iraq and afghanistan may reduce our ability to apply our ongoing investments in some market areas for example our engineered systems segment’s development of service oriented architectures for department of defense applications relies heavily on funding from customers who are actively competing for resources with war driven recapitalization resupply and modernization requirements 

 

as discussed elsewhere herein there has been a downturn in the general aviation market as a direct result of deteriorating economic and credit conditions in the united states and the world generally in addition to our aerospace engines and components segment as previously stated this deterioration could further impact battery sales of our energy and power systems segment while we will try to offset such impact with battery sales to the military and into other applications we may not be able to offset any such impact 

 

we may be unable to successfully introduce new and enhanced products in a timely and costeffective manner which could harm our growth and prospects 

 

our operating results depend in part on our ability to introduce new and enhanced products on a timely basis successful product development and introduction depend on numerous factors including our ability to anticipate customer and market requirements changes in technology and industry standards our ability to differentiate our offerings from offerings of our competitors and market acceptance we may not be able to develop and introduce new or enhanced products in a timely and costeffective manner or to develop and introduce products that satisfy customer requirements 

 

our new products also may not achieve market acceptance or correctly address new industry standards and technological changes as an example we continue to work to develop high power solid state power amplifiers which could replace our traveling wave tubes in some applications and in this field there is a larger base of potential competitors than there is for tube amplifiers as a result it may be more difficult for our solid state power amplifier products to gain market acceptance we may also lose any technological advantage to competitors if we fail to develop new products in a timely manner for example if teledyne continental motors fails to execute on its td300 turbo diesel engine it may be difficult to penetrate the diesel engine aircraft markets additionally if teledyne continental motors fails to fully launch its powerlink fadec an electronic engine control product competitors may be able to introduce similar products that are able to gain market acceptance to the disadvantage of teledyne’s product also in today’s economy general aviation aircraft owners may disregard technological advancements for upfront costssavings and determine that they do not yet need such electronic engine controls 

 

additionally new products may trigger increased warranty costs as such products are tested further by actual usage accelerated entry of new products to meet heightened market demand and competitive pressures may cause additional warranty costs as development and testing time periods might be accelerated or condensed 

 

technological change and evolving industry and regulatory standards could cause certain of our products or services to become obsolete or noncompetitive 

 

the markets for some of our products and services are characterized by rapid technological development evolving industry standards changes in customer requirements and new product introductions and enhancements a faster than anticipated change in one or more of the technologies related to our products or services or in market demand for products or services based on a particular technology could result in faster than 

anticipated obsolescence of certain of our products or services and could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition for example teledyne reynolds’ high voltage connector business could be negatively impacted by marketplace shifts to lower voltage requirements where the number of competitors is larger most lighting displays in legacy aircraft use illumination devices that require high voltage connectors led backlights which are increasingly being used for aircraft lighting displays have substantially lower voltage requirements 

 

currently accepted industry and regulatory standards are also subject to change which may contribute to the obsolescence of our products or services for example effective july 1 2006 a european directive referred to as rohs or the restriction on hazardous substances directive provided that certain electronic products must not contain impermissible levels of lead mercury cadmium hexavalent chromium polybrominated biphenyls or polybrominated diphenyl ethers as a result we must make sure that certain of our electronic products sold into european member states comply with this directive although many of our products are exempt from the european directive we continue to expect that over time component manufacturers may discontinue selling components that have the restricted substances this will in turn require us to accommodate changes in parameters such as the way parts are soldered and may in some cases require redesign of certain products this could lead to increased costs which we may not be able to recover from our customers delays in product shipments and loss of market share to competitors the european union’s 2007adopted registration evaluation authorization and restriction of chemical substance reform legislation commonly referred to as reach which requires registration and selective evaluation of more than 30000 chemical substances that are deemed of high risk to environment health and safety is also expected to have over time an impact on the electronics supply chain similar to the rohs additionally similar laws restricting hazardous substances have been promulgated in various noneuropean countries including china and korea as well as in various us states 

 

revenues of our teledyne test services business which provides testing and certification for products used in nuclear power plants could be negatively impacted in the event of any changes in certification standards by the nuclear regulatory commission 

 

additionally the us environmental protection agency continues to target general aviation fuel as a key contributor to lead in the atmosphere and could try to impose leadfree fuel regulations on general aviation such a change in the fuel standard could have an adverse impact on our aerospace engines and components segment including increasing research and development costs in part we have been working to manufacture an engine that uses diesel fuel to address this risk 

 

we may not be able to reduce the costs of our products to satisfy customers’ cost reduction mandates which could harm our sales or margins 

 

more and more customers continue to seek price reductions of our products while we continually work to reduce our manufacturing and other costs of our products without affecting product quality and reliability there is no assurance that we will be able to do so and do so in a timely manner to satisfy the pricing pressures of our customers cost reductions of raw materials and other components used in our products may be beyond our control depending on market credit and economic conditions customers may seek lower cost products from china and other developing countries where manufacturing costs are lower 

 

the airline industry is heavily regulated and if we fail to comply with applicable requirements our results of operations could suffer 

 

governmental agencies throughout the world including the us federal aviation administration or the faa prescribe standards and qualification requirements for aircraft components including virtually all commercial airline and general aviation products as well as regulations regarding the repair and overhaul of aircraft engines specific regulations vary from country to country although compliance with faa requirements generally satisfies regulatory requirements in other countries we include with the products and replacement parts that we sell to our aircraft industry customers documentation certifying that each part complies with applicable regulatory requirements and meets applicable standards of airworthiness established by the faa or the equivalent regulatory agencies in other countries in order to sell our products we and the 

products we manufacture must also be certified by our individual original equipment manufacturer or oem customers if any material authorization or approval qualifying us to supply our products is revoked or suspended then the sale of the product would be prohibited by law which would have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

from time to time the faa or equivalent regulatory agencies in other countries propose new regulations or changes to existing regulations which are usually more stringent than existing regulations if these proposed regulations are adopted and enacted we may incur significant additional costs to achieve compliance which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

increasing competition could reduce the demand for our products and services 

 

although we believe that we have certain advantages that help us compete in our markets each of our markets is highly competitive many of our competitors have and potential competitors could have greater name recognition a larger installed base of products more extensive engineering manufacturing marketing and distribution capabilities and greater financial technological and personnel resources than we do new or existing competitors may also develop new technologies that could adversely affect the demand for our products and services industry consolidation trends particularly among aerospace and defense contractors could adversely affect demand for our products and services if prime contractors seek to control more aspects of vertically integrated projects lowcost competition from china and other developing countries could also result in decreased demand for our products increasing competition could reduce the volume of our sales or the prices we may charge which would negatively impact our revenues 

 

we sell products to customers in industries that may again undergo rapid and unpredictable changes which could adversely affect our operations results or production levels 

 

we develop and manufacture products for customers in industries that have undergone rapid changes in the past for example we manufacture products and provide manufacturing services to companies that serve telecommunications markets during 2001 many segments of the telecommunications market experienced a dramatic and rapid downturn that resulted in cancellations or deferrals of orders for our products and services this market or others that we serve may exhibit rapid changes in the future and may adversely affect our operating results or our production levels or both we also manufacture products using fuel cell technology which is a market that is not wellestablished and subject to significant change and evolution 

 

our engineered systems segment manufactures gas centrifuge service modules for fluor enterprises inc acting as agent for usec inc used in the american centrifuge project we currently anticipate reduced sales of gas centrifuge service modules in 2010 due to a suspension of work notice received on august 13 2009 caused by the us department of energy’s delayed decision regarding usec’s application for a loan guarantee to complete construction of the american centrifuge project failure to secure such guarantees would seriously jeopardize usec’s ability to finance and therefore complete the project in such an event our engineered systems segment may experience reduced sales 

 

we are subject to the risks associated with international sales which could harm our business or results of operations 

 

during 2009 sales to international customers accounted for approximately 26 of our total revenues as compared to 24 in 2008 and 22 in 2007 we anticipate that future sales to international customers will continue to account for a significant percentage of our revenues risks associated with these sales include 

 

 29 

 

  

any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition exchange rate fluctuations may negatively affect the cost of our products to international customers and therefore reduce our competitive position if the us dollar strengthens against the british pound sterling or euro our european customers may no longer find our product prices more attractive than european competitors 

 

sales of our products and services internationally are subject to us and local government regulations and procurement policies and practices including regulations relating to importexport control violations of export control rules could result in suspension of our ability to export items from one or more business units or the entire corporation depending on the scope of the suspension this could have a material effect on our ability to perform certain international contracts concerns over theft of technology for military uses nuclear proliferation concerns terrorism and other factors have resulted in increased export scrutiny of international sales including some of our products to international customers there has also been increasing export oversight and regulation of sales to china travel restrictions to middle eastern and other countries may negatively affect continuing international sales or service revenues from such regions there are also us and international regulations relating to investments exchange controls and repatriation of earnings as well as varying currency political and economic risks 

 

among other things we are subject to the us foreign corrupt practices act or fcpa which generally prohibits us companies and their intermediaries from bribing foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or keeping business or otherwise obtaining favorable treatment in particular while we have procedures in place and conduct fcpa training we may be held liable for actions taken by our strategic or local partners even though our partners are not subject to the fcpa any determination that we had violated the fcpa could result in sanctions that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

our business and financial results could be adversely affected by conditions and other factors associated with our suppliers 

 

some items we purchase for the manufacture of our products including certain gyro components for some marine navigation applications are purchased from limited or single sources of supply due to technical capability price and other factors we have also outsourced from time to time the manufacturing of certain parts components subsystems and even finished products to single or limited sources including international sources for example teledyne relays outsources the manufacture of certain relays and relay components to taiwan and india as well as our own facility in mexico teledyne imaging sensors outsources the manufacture of readout integrated circuits for focal plane arrays to a taiwanese foundry disruption of these sources could cause delays or reductions in shipments of our products or increases in our costs which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or operations international sources possess additional risks some of which are similar to those described above in regard to international sales with continuing disruption in the global economy and financial markets some of our suppliers may also continue to face issues gaining access to sufficient credit to maintain their businesses which could reduce the availability of some components and to the extent such suppliers are single source suppliers could adversely affect our ability to continue to manufacture and sell our products continuing economic pressure on suppliers may also trigger increased pricing or workforce reductions or reduced workweeks possibly creating longer lead times to obtain needed components for our products 

compliance with increasing environmental and climate change regulations as well as the effects of potential environmental liabilities could have a material adverse financial effect on us 

 

we like other industry participants are subject to various federal state local and international environmental laws and regulations we may be subject to increasingly stringent environmental standards in the future particularly as green house gas emissions and climate change regulations and initiatives increase future developments administrative actions or liabilities relating to environmental and climate change matters could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

 

while we have as part of our overall risk management program an environmental management and compliance program applicable to our operating facilities including a “review and audit” program to monitor compliance where each facility is reviewed and audited by an internal environmental team every three years such program does not eliminate potential environmental liabilities in addition while we conduct environmentalrelated due diligence in acquisitions and generally seek some form of protection including indemnification from a seller companies we acquire may have environmental liabilities that are not accurately assessed or brought to our attention at the time of the acquisition 

 

for additional discussion of environmental matters see the discussion under the caption “other matters — environmental” of “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of results of operation and financial condition” and note 15 to notes to consolidated financial statements 

 

increased environmental regulatory monitoring requirements of the air we breathe and the water we drink could have a favorable effect on the results of operations or financial condition of our instrumentation businesses including the sulfur dioxide carbon monoxide and ozone gas monitoring business of teledyne advanced pollution instrumentation inc the air quality monitoring business of teledyne monitor labs inc the water quality monitoring business of teledyne isco inc and the mercury monitoring business of teledyne leeman labs in contrast the us environmental protection agency’s efforts to limit lead emissions from general aviation gasoline could adversely affect our aerospace engines and components segment consequently in part we have been working to manufacture an engine that uses unleaded diesel fuel to address this risk also while our leadacid battery manufacturing facility in redlands ca has scrubbers and other pollution control devices in place additional leadrelated airemission limitations and other requirements could trigger additional expenditures and adversely affect the financial results of our energy and power systems segment 

 

the us environmental protection agency announced that greenhouse gases ghgs threaten the public health and welfare of the american people epa also maintains that ghg emissions from onroad vehicles contribute to that threat epa’s endangerment finding covers emissions of six greenhouse gases — carbon dioxide methane nitrous oxide hydrofluorocarbons hfc perfluorocarbons pfc and sulfur hexafluoride sf6 epa’s efforts to limit ghg emissions could adversely affect our us manufacturing operations restrictions on carbon dioxide emissions may impact energy fuel and transportation prices restrictions on hfcs pfs and sf6 gases may impact the way these compounds are used and controlled at certain of our facilities this may in turn require us to accommodate changes in parameters such as the way parts are manufactured and may in some cases require redesign of certain products this could lead to increased costs which we may not be able to recover from customers delays in product shipments and loss of market share to competitors 

 

our inability to attract and retain key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our future success 

 

our future success depends to a significant extent upon the continued service of our executive officers and other key management and technical personnel and on our ability to continue to attract retain and motivate qualified personnel we also have a maturing work force while we have engaged in succession planning the loss of the services of one or more of our key employees or our failure to attract retain and motivate qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our engineered systems segment has been facing increasing competition for qualified engineering personnel as a result of the department of defense 2005 base realignment and closure also known as brac decisions particularly as positions continue to move to huntsville alabama over the next several years in addition the us secretary of defense announced in 2009 that the department would decrease the use of contractors in support services and increase funding for civil service positions in those areas as a result of this trend our engineered systems segment is losing personnel as their jobs are being changed from contractor to federal civil service positions the engineered systems segment is also losing personnel due to employees pursing vacancies that have been created in various industries as other employees accept employment with the us government 

 

a labor strike or work stoppage could have a material adverse affect on our business 

 

while we believe our overall relations with our employees to be good a labor strike or work stoppage at our unionrepresented facilities could have a material adverse effect on us the international union of united automobile aerospace and agricultural implement workers of america represents approximately 270 active employees at our teledyne continental motors piston engine manufacturing facility in mobile alabama under a collective bargaining agreement that expired by its terms on february 20 2010 this union also represents approximately 10 active employees at the teledyne turbine engines facility in toledo ohio under a collective bargaining agreement that expired on november 10 2009 while employees continue to work and labor negotiations are occurring under both agreements there is no assurance that a strike or work stoppage may not occur 

 

we may not be able to sell or exit on acceptable terms product lines that we determine no longer meet with our growth strategy 

 

consistent with our growth strategy to focus on markets to expand our profitable niche businesses we continually evaluate our product lines to ensure that they are aligned with our strategy for example after the june 2004 acquisition of isco inc we determined that the online process control instrumentation business of its german subsidiary was not aligned with our strategy and in march 2005 we sold this nonstrategic business in 2007 principally because of the decision of a customer to manufacture certain medical products at its facilities in india we closed our contract manufacturing operations in el rubi mexico and transferred the remaining operations to our la mesa mexico and our lewisburg tennessee facilities 

 

our ability to dispose of or exit product lines that may no longer be aligned with our growth strategy will depend on many factors including the terms and conditions of any asset purchase and sale agreement as well as industry business and economic conditions we cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to sell nonstrategic product lines on terms that are acceptable to us or at all also if the sale of any nonstrategic product line cannot be consummated or is not practical alternative courses of action including closure may not be available to us or may be more costly than anticipated 

 

provisions of our governing documents applicable law and our change in control severance agreements could make an acquisition of teledyne technologies more difficult 

 

our restated certificate of incorporation amended and restated bylaws and rights agreement and the general corporation law of the state of delaware contain several provisions that could make the acquisition of control of teledyne in a transaction not approved by our board of directors more difficult we have also entered into change in control severance agreements with 16 members of our management which could have an antitakeover effect these provisions may prevent or discourage attempts to acquire our company 

 

the market price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly since our spinoff from ati and could continue to do so 

 

since the spinoff from ati on november 29 1999 the market price of our common stock has ranged from a low of 76875 to a high of 6621 per share during 2009 alone the market price of our common 

stock ranged from 2165 to 4675 per share at february 26 2010 our closing stock price was 3767 fluctuations in our stock price could continue among the factors that could affect our stock price are 

 

  

the stock markets in general and the markets for high technology companies in particular have experienced a high degree of volatility that is not necessarily related to the operating performance of these companies we cannot provide assurances as to our stock price 

 

our financial statements are based on estimates required by gaap and actual results may differ materially from those estimated under different assumptions or conditions 

 

our financial statements are prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states these principles require our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period for example estimates are used when accounting for items such as asset valuations allowances for doubtful accounts depreciation and amortization impairment assessments employee benefits taxes recall costs aircraft product and general liability and contingencies while we base our estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances at the time made actual results may differ materially from those estimated 

 

while we believe our internal control systems are effective there are inherent limitations in all control systems and misstatements resulting from error or fraud may occur and may not be detected 

 

we continue to take action to assure compliance with the internal controls disclosure controls and other requirements of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer cannot guarantee that our internal controls and disclosure controls will prevent all possible errors or all fraud a control system no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met in addition the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefit of controls must be relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no system of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within the company have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake further controls can be circumvented by individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more persons or by management override of the 

controls the design of any system of controls is also based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions over time a control may be inadequate because of changes in conditions or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate because of inherent limitations in a costeffective control system misstatements resulting from error or fraud may occur and may not be detected 

 

natural disasters such as a serious earthquake or wildfire in california or a major hurricane in alabama florida or texas could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

 

several of our facilities as a result of their locations could be subject to a catastrophic loss caused by earthquakes hurricanes tornados floods or other natural disasters many of our production facilities and our headquarters are located in california and thus are in areas with above average seismic activity and may also be at risk of damage in wildfires in addition we have manufacturing facilities in the southeastern united states and texas that have been threatened and struck by major hurricanes our facilities in alabama florida nebraska and tennessee have also been threatened by tornados while teledyne continental motors’ pistonengines manufacturing facility and teledyne turbine engines’ advanced manufacturing cell each located in mobile alabama teledyne geophysical instruments’ facility in houston texas odi’s facility in daytona beach florida and teledyne odom’s facility in baton rouge louisiana were relatively fortunate with respect to the building damage and business interruption they suffered during the severe 2005 hurricane season there can be no assurance that any one of them will be as fortunate in the future if any of our california facilities including our california headquarters were to experience a catastrophic earthquake or wildfire loss or if any of our alabama florida louisiana nebraska tennessee or texas facilities were to experience a catastrophic hurricane storm tornado or other natural disaster such event could disrupt our operations delay production shipments and revenue and result in large expenses to repair or replace the facility or facilities while teledyne has property insurance to partially reimburse it for losses caused by windstorm and earth movement such insurance would not cover all possible losses in addition our existing disaster recovery and business continuity plans including those relating to our information technology systems may not be fully responsive to or minimize losses associated with catastrophic events

recent acquisitions 

 

the following summarizes the acquisitions we made during fiscal years 2009 2008 and 2007 other than the purchase of the assets of a marine sensor product line for 14 million and all of the remaining 141 minority interest in ocean design inc “odi” for 255 million no other acquisitions were made in fiscal year 2009 see also note 3 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information about these acquisitions

financial highlights 

 

our fiscal year is determined based on a 52 or 53week convention ending on the sunday nearest to december 31 fiscal year 2009 contained 53 weeks while fiscal years 2007 and 2008 contained 52 weeks the following is our financial information for 2009 2008 and 2007 in millions except pershare amounts 

 

 

 

 

 40 

  

our businesses are divided into and managed as four business segments namely electronics and communications engineered systems aerospace engines and components and energy and power systems our four business segments and their respective contributions to our total sales in 2009 2008 and 2007 are summarized in the following table 

 

 

 

results of operations 

 

2009 compared with 2008 

 

 

 

 

 41 

 

  

we reported 2009 sales of 17652 million compared with sales of 18930 million for 2008 a decrease of 68 net income attributable to teledyne technologies was 1133 million 310 per diluted share for 2009 compared with 1113 million 305 per diluted share for 2008 an increase of 18 

 

the decrease in sales in 2009 compared with 2008 reflected lower sales in each operating segment sales in the electronic and communications segment included the impact of acquisitions made in fiscal 2008 the incremental increase in revenue in 2009 from businesses acquired since 2008 was 399 million see “recent acquisitions” table 

 

the decrease in segment operating profit and other segment income for 2009 compared with 2008 reflected the impact of lower sales operating profit and other segment income was lower in each operating segment operating profit in the electronics and communications segment included incremental operating profit from acquisitions and related synergies of 12 million the aerospace engines and components segment includes the net impact of product recall and replacement costs of 13 million and 180 million for 2009 and 2008 respectively 

 

cost of sales in total dollars was lower in 2009 compared with 2008 primarily due to lower sales cost of sales in 2009 included 12 million in lifo income compared with 09 million in lifo expense in 2008 cost of sales in 2008 included the impact of the 180 million voluntary product recall and replacement charge for the aerospace engines and components segment of the total 180 million charge 158 million was related to the costs associated with the return and replacement of product and 14 million was related to the disposal and writeoff of inventory both of which were recorded as cost of sales and 08 million was related to estimated customer returns and was recorded as a reduction to sales cost of sales as a percentage of sales for 2009 was 712 compared with 708 for 2008 the higher cost of sales percentage reflected the impact of lower sales and increased pension expense partially offset by cost reductions made throughout the year and the absence of the costs related to the 2008 return and replacement program 

 

selling general and administrative expenses including research and development and bid and proposal expense in total dollars were lower in 2009 compared with 2008 this 214 million decrease was primarily due to lower sales lower acquired intangible asset amortization of 36 million lower corporate administrative expense and lower stock option expense corporate administrative expense in 2009 was lower by 23 million compared with 2008 and reflected reduced employee compensation and professional fee expenses for 2009 we recorded a total of 54 million in stock option expense of which 18 million was recorded as corporate expense and 36 million was recorded in the operating segment results for 2008 we recorded a total of 75 million in stock option expense of which 25 million was recorded as corporate expense and 50 million was recorded in the operating segment results selling general and administrative expenses for 2009 as a percentage of sales increased slightly to 194 compared with 193 for 2008 

 

included in operating profit in 2009 was pension expense of 225 million of which 124 million was recoverable in accordance with us government cost accounting standards “cas” from certain government contracts included in operating profit in 2008 was pension expense of 96 million of which 98 million was recoverable in accordance with cas pension expense determined under cas can generally be recovered through the pricing of products and services sold to the us government 

 

the company’s effective tax rate for 2009 was 294 compared with 364 for 2008 the effective tax rate for total year 2009 reflected the impact of prior year research and development tax credits of 143 million the reversal of 12 million in income tax contingency reserves which were determined to be no longer needed due to the expiration of applicable statutes of limitations and additional income tax expense of 05 million 

primarily related to the impact of california income tax law changes excluding these items the effective tax rate for total year 2009 would have been 387 the effective tax rate for 2008 reflects the impact of prior year research and development tax credits of 25 million and the reversal of 08 million in income tax contingency reserves that were determined to be no longer needed due to the expiration of applicable statutes of limitations excluding these items the effective tax rate for 2008 would have been 382 

 

during the next twelve months it is reasonably possible that tax audit resolutions and expirations of the statutes of limitations could reduce unrecognized tax benefits by 26 million to 87 million either because our tax positions are sustained on audit because the company agrees to their disallowance or the expiration of the statutes of limitations 

 

sales under contracts with the us government were approximately 44 of sales in 2009 and 40 of sales in 2008 sales to international customers represented approximately 26 of sales in 2009 compared with 24 of sales in 2008 

 

total interest expense including credit facility fees and other bank charges was 51 million in 2009 and 117 million in 2008 interest income was 03 million in 2009 and 08 million in 2008 the decrease in interest expense in 2009 primarily reflected lower average interest rates 

 

noncontrolling interest in subsidiaries’ earnings reflects the minority ownership interest in odi and teledyne energy systems inc the lower amount in 2009 primarily reflects the decrease in minority ownership interest in odi due to share purchases by teledyne in 2008 and 2009 in 2009 teledyne purchased the remaining minority interest in odi 

 

other income in 2009 and 2008 include sublease rental income and royalty income 

 

2008 compared with 2007 in millions 

 

 

 

 

 43 

 

  

we reported 2008 sales of 18930 million compared with sales of 16223 million for 2007 an increase of 167 net income attributable to teledyne technologies was 1113 million 305 per diluted share for 2008 compared with 985 million 272 per diluted share for 2007 an increase of 130 

 

the increase in sales in 2008 compared with 2007 reflected improvement in the electronic and communications engineered systems and energy and power systems segments the largest increase in sales was in the electronic and communications segment which grew both organically and through strategic acquisitions made in 2008 and in 2007 the incremental increase in revenue in 2008 from businesses acquired since 2006 was 1429 million see “recent acquisitions” table 

 

the increase in segment operating profit and other segment income for 2008 compared with 2007 reflected the impact of higher sales operating profit and other segment income was higher in each operating segment except the aerospace engines and components segment the 398 million increase in operating profit in the electronics and communications segment included incremental operating profit from acquisitions and related synergies of 178 million the aerospace engines and components segment includes the impact of an 180 million charge for a voluntary product recall and replacement program 

 

cost of sales in total dollars was higher in 2008 compared with 2007 primarily due to higher sales which resulted from organic growth and acquisitions fiscal year 2008 included 09 million in lifo expense compared with 13 million in lifo expense in 2007 cost of sales as a percentage of sales for 2008 was 708 compared with 700 for 2007 the higher cost of sales percentage reflects the impact of the 180 million voluntary product recall and replacement charge for the aerospace engines and components segment of the total 180 million charge 158 million was related to the costs associated with the return and replacement of product and 14 million was related to the disposal and writeoff of inventory both of which were recorded as cost of sales and 08 million was related to estimated customer returns and was recorded as a reduction to sales 

 

selling general and administrative expenses including research and development and bid and proposal expense in total dollars were higher in 2008 compared with 2007 this 410 million increase was primarily due to higher sales which resulted from organic growth and acquisitions and also reflected higher acquired intangible asset amortization of 158 million in 2008 compared with 64 million in 2007 corporate administrative expense in 2008 was lower by 30 million compared with 2007 and reflected lower employee compensation and relocation expense and lower professional fee expenses for 2008 we recorded a total of 75 million in stock option expense of which 25 million was recorded as corporate expense and 50 million was recorded in the operating segment results for 2007 we recorded a total of 68 million in stock option expense of which 23 million was recorded as corporate expense and 45 million was recorded in the operating segment results selling general and administrative expenses for 2008 as a percentage of sales were 193 compared with 199 for 2007 which reflected the impact of higher sales while controlling general and administrative expenses 

 

included in operating profit in 2008 was pension expense of 96 million which was more than offset by 98 million recoverable in accordance with cas from certain government contracts included in operating profit in 2007 was pension expense of 119 million of which 102 million was recoverable in accordance with cas 

 

the company’s effective tax rate for 2008 was 364 compared with 333 for 2007 the effective tax rate for 2008 reflects the impact of prior year research and development tax credits of 25 million and also reflects the reversal of 08 million in income tax contingency reserves that were determined to be no longer needed due to the expiration of applicable statutes of limitations excluding these items the effective tax rate 

for 2008 would have been 382 the effective tax rate for 2007 reflects the impact of prior year research and development tax credits of 44 million and also reflects the reversal of 11 million in income tax contingency reserves the reserves were determined to be no longer needed due to the completion of state tax audits and the expiration of applicable statutes of limitations excluding these items the effective tax rate for 2007 would have been 369 

 

sales under contracts with the us government were approximately 40 of sales in 2008 and 41 of sales in 2007 sales to international customers represented approximately 24 of sales in 2008 compared with 22 of sales in 2007 

 

total interest expense including credit facility fees and other bank charges was 117 million in 2008 and 131 million in 2007 interest income was 08 million in 2008 and 06 million in 2007 the decrease in interest expense in 2008 primarily reflected lower average interest rates partially offset by higher outstanding debt levels due to acquisitions 

 

minority interest reflects the minority ownership interests in odi and teledyne energy systems inc the minority interest ownership percentage in odi decreased to 14 at yearend 2008 since the initial 51 purchase of odi in august 2006 

 

other income in 2008 and 2007 include sublease rental income and royalty income other income in 2007 also included 08 million received for the early return of leased property

sales for 2008 compared with 2007 reflected reduced oem piston engine and spare parts sales the decrease in operating profit in 2008 compared with 2007 reflected a charge of 180 million for product recall and replacement costs the impact of lower sales and higher defense and settlement fees the 180 million charge was required to replace certain aircraft piston engine cylinders produced since november 2007 operating profit in 2007 included the receipt of a litigation settlement of 14 million net of expenses and the 17 million writedown of accounts receivable related to a customer bankruptcy segment operating profit also included pension expense of 06 million in 2008 compared with 07 million for 2007 segment operating profit for 2008 also reflected higher lifo expense of 05 million 

 

energy and power systems 

 

 

 

our energy and power systems segment provides hydrogen gas generators thermoelectric and fuel cellbased power sources turbine engines and aviation batteries delays in production funding on the joint airtosurface standoff missile “jassm” are expected to result in lower sales in 2010 

 

2009 compared with 2008 

 

our energy and power systems segment sales were 729 million in 2009 compared with sales of 842 million in 2008 a decrease of 134 operating income was 33 million in 2009 compared with 102 million in 2008 a decrease of 676 

 

the decrease in sales for 2009 compared with 2008 reflected higher government power systems sales more than offset by lower turbine engines commercial hydrogen generators and battery product sales operating profit reflected the impact of lower sales and a 10 million product replacement reserve for commercial hydrogen generators for energy systems partially offset by lower lifo expense of 07 million operating profit in 2008 was favorably impacted by 13 million for environmental reserves no longer needed due to a final settlement 

 

2008 compared with 2007

the increase in sales for 2008 compared with 2007 primarily resulted from higher government power systems sales and higher turbine engine sales primarily due to jassm engines commercial hydrogen generator sales increased slightly operating profit in 2008 reflected the impact of higher sales higher margins in the turbine engine business and the reversal of 13 million for environmental reserves no longer needed due to a final settlement 

 

financial condition liquidity and capital resources 

 

principal capital requirements 

 

our principal capital requirements are to fund working capital needs capital expenditures voluntary and required pension contributions debt service requirements and acquisitions it is anticipated that operating cash flow together with available borrowings under the credit facility described below will be sufficient to meet these requirements and could be used to fund some acquisitions in the year 2010 to support acquisitions we may need to raise additional capital our liquidity is not dependent upon the use of offbalance sheet financial arrangements we have no offbalance sheet financing arrangements that incorporate the use of special purpose entities or unconsolidated entities 

 

revolving credit agreement 

 

on february 8 2008 teledyne entered into a first amendment to its amended and restated credit agreement dated as of july 14 2006 the amended and restated credit facility has lender commitments totaling 5900 million and expires on july 14 2011 excluding interest and fees no payments are due under the amended and restated credit facility until it matures the credit agreement requires the company to comply with various financial and operating covenants including maintaining certain consolidated leverage and interest coverage ratios as well as minimum net worth levels and limits on acquired debt at january 3 2010 we were in compliance with these covenants total debt at yearend 2009 includes 2400 million outstanding under the 5900 million credit facility available borrowing capacity under the 5900 million credit facility which is reduced by borrowings outstanding letters of credit and certain guarantees was 3363 million at january 3 2010 for a description of some terms of our credit facility see “financing activities” beginning on page 53 

 

in addition although our 5900 million credit facility does not terminate until july 2011 we are planning to refinance such credit facility prior to its scheduled maturity we expect that our interest rates will be higher with any new or renewed facility due to changes in market conditions since our last credit facility was put in place we may also elect to raise other forms of debt capital depending on financial market and economic conditions 

 

contractual obligations 

 

the following table summarizes our expected cash outflows resulting from financial contracts and commitments at january 3 2010 we have not included information on our normal recurring purchases of materials for use in our operations these amounts are generally consistent from year to year closely reflect our levels of production and are not longterm in nature in millions

at january 3 2010 we do not have a minimum qualified pension plan funding requirement for 2010 teledyne expects to make a voluntary pretax contribution to its qualified pension plan of approximately 370 million in the third quarter of 2010 based on current assumptions and expected contributions to be made in 2010 we would not have a minimum qualified pension plan funding requirement as set forth by erisa in 2011 our minimum funding requirements after 2009 are dependent on several factors as discussed under “accounting for pension plans” in the critical accounting policies section of this management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation estimates beyond 2011 have not been provided due to the significant uncertainty of these amounts which are subject to change until the company’s pension assumptions can be updated at the appropriate times in addition certain pension contributions are eligible for future recovery through the pricing of products and services to the us government under certain government contracts therefore the amounts noted are not necessarily indicative of the impact these contributions may have on our liquidity we also have payments due under our other postretirement benefits plans these plans are not required to be funded in advance but are pay as you go see further discussion in note 12 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

 

on august 16 2006 teledyne through its subsidiary teledyne instruments inc acquired an initial majority interest in odi for approximately 30 million in cash pursuant to agreements made in connection with our acquisition of a majority interest in odi teledyne instruments made subsequent share purchases at a formuladetermined price based principally on odi’s earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda for the twelve months preceding each applicable quarter end in 2009 teledyne instruments purchased all the remaining minority shares for 255 million and now owns 100 of odi ownership purchases in odi were as follows including the initial purchase in 2006 and the final purchase in 2009 2006 — 609 for 358 million 2007 — 09 for 09 million 2008 — 241 for 385 million and 2009 — 141 for 255 million 

 

operating activities 

 

in 2009 net cash provided by operating activities was 1549 million compared with 1204 million in 2008 and 1667 million in 2007 

 

the higher net cash provided for 2009 compared with 2008 reflected lower income tax payments of 342 million lower aircraft product defense and settlement payments of 230 million the incremental cash contribution from acquisitions made in 2008 and improved working capital management partially offset by higher pretax pension contributions of 583 million 

 

the lower net cash provided for 2008 compared with 2007 was primarily due to higher pretax voluntary pension contributions of 524 million higher aircraft product defense and settlement payments of 255 million and higher working capital requirements partially offset by higher net income the incremental cash contribution from recent acquisitions and lower income tax payments of 225 million 

free cash flow cash from operating activities less capital expenditures was 1187 million compared with 785 million in 2008 and 1264 million in 2007 

 

 

 

 

  

working capital 

 

working capital decreased to 2506 million at yearend 2009 compared with 2813 million at yearend 2008 the decrease in working capital reflected the lower sales level in 2009 compared with 2008 including lower accounts receivable and inventory balances 

 

balance sheet changes 

 

the changes in the following selected components of teledyne’s balance sheet are discussed below in millions 

 

 

 

the lower balances in accounts receivable and inventory reflected the impact of the lower sales level in 2009 compared with 2008 the lower balance in shortterm accrued liabilities reflected the use of most of the 158 million reserve for product recall and replacement reserves established at the end of 2008 as well as a reduced level of customer advances the decrease in longterm deferred income taxes was primarily due to the pension contributions in 2009 the decrease in acquired intangible assets primarily reflected current year amortization the decrease in longterm debt and capital lease obligations primarily reflected the use of cash flow to reduce the debt balance the accrued pension obligation decreased primarily as a result of pension contributions and a decrease in the unfunded pension liability in 2009 due to the increase in pension assets during the year resulting from positive market returns as well as the positive impact of demographic experience compared to original assumptions the balance in redeemable minority interest was eliminated in connection with the purchase of the remaining minority interest in odi the change in the accumulated other 

comprehensive loss reflected the 309 million noncash adjustment related to the decrease in the unfunded pension liability in 2009 

 

investing activities 

 

net cash used in investing activities included capital expenditures as presented below 

 

capital expenditures 

 

 

 

during 2010 we plan to invest approximately 400 million in capital expenditures principally to upgrade capital equipment reduce manufacturing costs and introduce new products commitments at january 3 2010 for capital expenditures were approximately 68 million

teledyne funded the acquisitions primarily from borrowings under its credit facility and cash on hand 

 

in all acquisitions the results of operations and cash flows are included in our consolidated financial statements from the date of each respective acquisition each of the companies acquired is part of the electronics and communications segment during 2009 we completed the process of specifically identifying the amount to be assigned to intangible assets as well as certain assets and liabilities for the webb filtronic cormon odom and demo acquisitions made in fiscal 2008 we completed the purchase price valuation for the webb acquisition and as a result goodwill was decreased by 10 million and other acquired intangible assets were increased by 11 million we completed the purchase price valuation for the filtronic acquisition and as a result goodwill was increased by 52 million other acquired intangible assets were decreased by 37 million and accrued liabilities were increased by 15 million we completed the purchase price valuation for the cormon acquisition and as a result goodwill was decreased by 51 million and other acquired intangible assets were increased by 53 million we completed the purchase price valuation for the odom acquisition and as a result goodwill was decreased by 08 million and other acquired intangible assets were increased by 08 million we completed the purchase price valuation for the demo acquisition and as a result goodwill was increased by 09 million other acquired intangible assets were decreased by 02 million and inventory was decreased by 07 million 

the following table shows the purchase price goodwill acquired and intangible assets acquired for the acquisitions made in fiscal 2008 and includes changes resulting from completion in 2009 of the purchase price valuation for certain acquisitions in millions 

 

 

 

except for the storm and demo acquisitions goodwill resulting from the acquisitions made in fiscal 2008 and 2009 will be deductible for tax purposes 

 

the following is a summary at the acquisition date of the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed for the acquisitions made in fiscal 2008 in millions

as of january 1 2004 nonunion new hires participate in an enhanced defined contribution plan as opposed to the company’s existing defined benefit pension plan teledyne anticipates making aftertax cash contributions of approximately 226 million to its pension plan in 2010 before recovery from the us government 

 

other matters 

 

income taxes 

 

the company’s effective tax rate for 2009 was 294 compared with 364 for 2008 and 333 for 2007 the effective tax rate for 2009 reflected the impact of prior year research and development tax credits of 143 million the reversal of 12 million in income tax contingency reserves which were determined to be no longer needed due to the expiration of applicable statutes of limitations and additional income tax expense of 05 million primarily related to the impact of california income tax law changes excluding these items the company’s effective tax rate for total year 2009 would have been 387 the effective tax rate for total year 2008 reflected the impact of prior year research and development tax credits of 25 million and the reversal of 08 million in income tax contingency reserves which were determined to be no longer needed due to the expiration of applicable statutes of limitations excluding these items the company’s effective tax rate for total year 2008 would have been 382 the effective tax rate for 2007 reflects the impact of prior year research and development tax credits of 44 million and also reflects the reversal of 11 million in income tax contingency reserves which were determined to be no longer needed due to the completion of state tax audits and the expiration of applicable statutes of limitations excluding these items the effective tax rate for 2007 would have been 377 based on the company’s history of operating earnings expectations of future operating earnings and potential tax planning strategies it is more likely than not that the deferred income tax assets at january 3 2010 will be realized 

costs and pricing 

 

inflationary trends in recent years have been moderate current inventory costs the increasing costs of equipment and other costs are considered in establishing sales pricing policies the company emphasizes cost containment in all aspects of its business 

 

hedging activities market risk disclosures 

 

we have not entered into any derivative financial instruments such as futures contracts options and swaps forward foreign exchange contracts or interest rate swaps and futures during 2009 or 2008 we have no derivative financial instruments outstanding at january 3 2010 we believe that adequate controls are in place to monitor any hedging activities our primary exposure to market risk relates to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates we periodically evaluate these risks and have taken measures to mitigate these risks we own assets and operate facilities in countries that have been politically stable also our foreign risk management objectives are geared towards stabilizing cash flow from the effects of foreign currency fluctuations most of our sales are denominated in us dollars which mitigates the effect of exchange rate changes borrowings under our credit facility are at fixed rates that vary with the term and timing of each loan under the facility loans under the facility typically have terms of one two three or six months and the interest rate for each such loan is subject to change if the loan is continued or converted following the applicable maturity date interest rates are also subject to change based on our debt to earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization ratio as of january 3 2010 we had 2400 million in outstanding indebtedness under our amended and restated credit facility a 100 basis point change in interest rates would result in an increase in annual interest expense of approximately 24 million assuming the 2400 million in debt was outstanding for the full year any borrowings under the company’s revolving credit line are based on a fluctuating market interest rate and consequently the fair value of any outstanding debt should not be affected materially by changes in market interest rates overall we believe that our exposure to interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange rate changes is not material to our financial condition or results of operations

environmental 

 

we are subject to various federal state local and international environmental laws and regulations which require that we investigate and remediate the effects of the release or disposal of materials at sites associated with past and present operations these include sites at which teledyne has been identified as a potentially responsible party under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act commonly known as superfund and comparable state laws we are currently involved in the investigation and remediation of a number of sites reserves for environmental investigation and remediation totaled 30 million 

at january 3 2010 and 29 million at december 28 2008 as investigation and remediation of these sites proceed and new information is received the company expects that accruals will be adjusted to reflect new information based on current information we do not believe that future environmental costs in excess of those already accrued will materially and adversely affect our financial condition or liquidity however resolution of one or more of these environmental matters or future accrual adjustments in any one reporting period could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations for that period see also our environmental risk factor disclosure beginning at page 31 

 

for additional discussion of environmental matters see notes 2 and 15 to the notes to consolidated financial statements 

 

government contracts 

 

we perform work on a number of contracts with the department of defense and other agencies and departments of the us government including subcontracts with government prime contractors sales under these contracts with the us government which included contracts with the department of defense were approximately 44 of total sales in 2009 40 of total sales in 2008 and 41 of total sales in 2007 for a summary of sales to the us government by segment see note 13 to the notes to consolidated financial statements sales to the department of defense represented approximately 33 29 and 30 of total sales for 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively see also our government contracts risks factor disclosure beginning at page 18 

 

performance under government contracts has certain inherent risks that could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business results of operations and financial condition government contracts are conditioned upon the continuing availability of congressional appropriations which usually occurs on a fiscal year basis even though contract performance may take more than one year 

 

for information on accounts receivable from the us government see note 5 to the notes to consolidated financial statements 

 

estimates and reserves 

 

our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent liabilities on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including those related to product returns and replacements allowance for doubtful accounts inventories intangible assets income taxes warranty obligations pension and other postretirement benefits longterm contracts environmental workers’ compensation and general liability aircraft product liability employee dental and medical benefits and other contingencies and litigation we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances at the time the results of which form the basis for making our judgments actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions in some cases such differences may be material see “other matters — critical accounting policies” 

the following table reflects significant reserves and valuation accounts which are estimates and based on judgments as described above at january 3 2010 and december 28 2008 

 

reserves and valuation accounts a 

 

 

 

 

  

some of the company’s products are subject to specified warranties and the company provides for the estimated cost of product warranties we regularly assess the adequacy of our preexisting warranty liabilities and adjust amounts as necessary based on a review of historic warranty experience with respect to the applicable business or products as well as the length and actual terms of the warranties which are typically one year the product warranty reserve is included in current and long term accrued liabilities and other longterm liabilities on the balance sheet changes in the company’s product warranty reserve are as follows in millions 

 

 

 

critical accounting policies 

 

the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with united states generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the notes to the financial statements some of those judgments can be subjective and complex and therefore actual results could differ materially from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions our critical accounting policies are those that are reflective of significant judgment complexity and uncertainty and may potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions we have identified the following as critical accounting policies revenue recognition aircraft product liability reserve accounting for pension plans accounting for business combinations goodwill and other longlived assets and accounting for income taxes for additional discussion of the application of these and other accounting policies see note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

 

revenue recognition 

 

commercial sales and sales from us government fixedprice type contracts are generally recorded as shipments are made or as services are rendered occasionally for certain fixedprice type contracts that require substantial performance over a long time period generally one or more years revenues are recorded under the percentageofcompletion method we measure the extent of progress toward completion using the 

unitsofdelivery method costtocost method or upon attainment of scheduled performance milestones which could be time event or expense driven occasionally invoices are submitted to and paid by the customer under a contractual agreement which has a different time schedule than the related revenue recognition sales under costreimbursement contracts usually from the us government are recorded as allowable costs are incurred and fees are earned 

 

the development of cost of sales percentages used to record costs under certain fixedprice type contracts and fees under certain costreimbursement type contracts requires management’s judgment to make reasonably dependable cost estimates for the design manufacture and delivery of products and services generally over a long time period since certain fixedprice and costreimbursement type contracts extend over a long period of time the impact of revisions in cost and revenue estimates during the progress of work may adjust the current period earnings on a cumulative catchup basis this method recognizes in the current period the cumulative effect of the changes on current and prior quarters for fixedprice contracts if the current contract estimate indicates a loss a provision is made for the total anticipated loss in the period that it becomes evident contract cost and revenue estimates for significant contracts are generally reviewed and reassessed quarterly these types of contracts and estimates are most frequently related to our sales to the us government or sales to other defense contractors for ultimate sale to the us government the company follows the revenue recognition criteria under accounting standards codification “asc” 60510s991 revenue recognition formerly sab topic 13a3a bill and hold arrangements for our sales to the us government in 2009 2008 and 2007 operating income as a percent of sales did not vary by more than 07 if operating income as a percent of sales to the us government had been higher or lower by 07 in 2009 the company’s operating income would have changed by approximately 47 million 

 

aircraft product liability reserve 

 

we are currently involved in certain legal proceedings related to aircraft product liability claims we have accrued an estimate for the probable costs for the resolution of these claims at january 3 2010 we have a reserve of 447 million for aircraft product liability claims of which 23 million is current this estimate has been developed in consultation with our insurers outside counsel handling our defense in these matters historical experience the number and nature of claims the level of annual selfinsurance retentions past payment history and is based upon an analysis of potential results assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies we do not believe these proceedings will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position it is possible however that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by specific events occurring in the period changes in our assumptions or the effectiveness of our strategies related to these proceedings the company has aircraft and product liability insurance the current annual selfinsurance retention is 172 million compared with 201 million in 2008 if a significant liability claim or combination of claims were identified even taking into account insurance coverage operating profit in a given period could be reduced significantly accruals could be made in a given period for amounts up to our annual selfinsurance retention based on the facts and circumstances of the claims we have not always accrued amounts up to our annual selfinsurance retention we could incur losses above the aggregate annual policy limit as well also we cannot assure that for 2010 and in future years our ability to obtain insurance or the premiums for such insurance or the amount of our selfinsured retention or reserves will not be negatively impacted by our experience in prior years or other factors our current aircraft product liability insurance policy expires in may 2010 

 

accounting for pension plans 

 

the company’s accounting for its defined benefit pension plan requires that amounts recognized in financial statements be determined on an actuarial basis rather than as contributions are made to the plan a significant element in determining the company’s pension income or expense is the expected return on plan assets as well as the assumed discount rate on pension liabilities the company has assumed based upon the types of securities the plan assets are invested in and the longterm historical returns of these investments that the longterm expected return on pension assets will be 825 in 2010 and its assumed discount rate will be 625 in 2010 the company’s longterm expected return on pension assets used in 2009 was 825 and the assumed discount rate used in 2009 was 625 the actual rate of return on pension assets was 125 in 2009 

and a negative 282 in 2008 if the actual rate of return on pension assets is above the projection the company may be able to reduce its contributions to the pension trust if the actual rate of return on pension assets is below the projection the company may be required to make additional contributions to the pension trust the company made aftertax contributions of 711 million to its pension benefit plans in 2009 and currently anticipates making an aftertax cash contribution of approximately 226 million to its pension benefit plans in 2010 before recovery from the us government the assumed longterm rate of return on assets is applied to the marketrelated value of plan assets at the end of the previous year this produces the expected return on plan assets that is included in annual pension income or expense calculation for the current year the cumulative difference between this expected return and the actual return on plan assets is deferred and amortized into pension income or expense over future periods at yearend 2009 the company has a 1602 million noncash reduction to stockholders’ equity and a longterm additional liability of 2636 million related to its pension plans at yearend 2008 the company had a 1913 million noncash reduction to stockholders’ equity and a longterm additional liability of 3150 million related to its pension plans see note 12 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional pension disclosures 

 

differences in the discount rate and expected longterm rate of return on assets within the indicated range would have had the following impact on 2009 pension expense

accounting for business combinations goodwill acquired intangible assets and other longlived assets 

 

the company accounts for goodwill and purchased intangible assets under asc 80 formerly sfas no 141r “business combinations” in all acquisitions the results are generally included in the company’s consolidated financial statements from the date of each respective acquisition business acquisitions are accounted for under the purchase method by assigning the purchase price to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at their fair values and the excess of the purchase price over the amounts assigned is recorded as goodwill purchased intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives adjustments to fair value assessments are recorded to goodwill over the purchase price allocation period generally not longer than twelve months with the exception of certain adjustments related to income tax uncertainties the resolution of which may extend beyond the purchase price allocation period 

 

goodwill and acquired intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized we review goodwill and acquired indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable the company also performs an annual impairment test in the fourth quarter of each year based on the annual impairment test completed in the fourth quarter of 2009 no impairment of goodwill or intangible assets with indefinite lives was indicated the company estimates the fair value of the reporting units which are our four business segments using a discounted cash flow model based on our best estimate of amounts and timing of future revenues and cash flows and our most recent business and strategic plans and compares the estimated fair value to the net book value of the reporting unit including goodwill the development of future revenue and cash flow projections for our business and strategic plan and the annual impairment test involve significant judgments changes in these projections could affect the estimated fair value of certain of the company’s reporting units and could result in a goodwill impairment charge in a future period however a 10 percent decrease in the current fair value estimate of each of the company’s reporting units would not result in a goodwill impairment charge 

 

we monitor the recoverability of the carrying value of our longlived assets an impairment charge is recognized when events and circumstances indicate that the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated 

by an asset including any proceeds from dispositions are less than the carrying value of the asset and the asset’s carrying value is less than its fair value our cash flow estimates are based on historical results adjusted to reflect our best estimate of future market and operating conditions the net carrying value of assets not recoverable is reduced to fair value our estimates of fair value represent our best estimate based on industry trends and reference to market rates and transactions our determination of what constitutes an indication of possible impairment the estimation of future cash flows and the determination of estimated fair value are all significant judgments 

 

accounting for income taxes 

 

income tax expense and deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect management’s assessment of actual future taxes to be paid on items reflected in the financial statements significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes uncertainty exists regarding tax positions taken in previously filed tax returns still under examination and positions expected to be taken in future returns deferred tax assets and liabilities arise due to differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and tax carryforwards although we believe our income tax expense and deferred tax assets and liabilities are reasonable no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome will not be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals to the extent that the final tax outcome is different than the amounts recorded such differences will impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made the provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate as well as the related net interest 

 

significant judgment is required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets in assessing the need for a valuation allowance we consider all available evidence including past operating results estimates of future taxable income and the feasibility of tax planning strategies in the event that we change our determination as to the amount of deferred tax assets that can be realized we will adjust our valuation allowance with a corresponding impact to the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made 

 

our effective tax rates differ from the statutory rate primarily due to the tax impact of the prior year research and development tax credits state taxes and tax audit settlements the effective tax rate was 294 364 and 341 in fiscal 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively 

 

the following presents a rollforward of our unrecognized tax benefits in millions 

 

 

 

we recognized interest related to unrecognized tax benefits of 09 million and 05 million within the provision for income taxes in our statements of operations for fiscal year 2009 and 2008 respectively 

 

as of january 3 2010 we estimated that the entire balance of unrecognized tax benefits if resolved in our favor would positively impact the effective tax rate and therefore be recognized as additional tax benefits in our income statement 

we file income tax returns in the united states federal jurisdiction and in various states and foreign jurisdictions except for refund claims related to credits for research activities the company has substantially concluded on all us federal income tax matters for all years through 2005 substantially all other material state and local and foreign income tax matters have been concluded for years through 2004 

 

the company anticipates the total unrecognized tax benefit for various federal and state tax items may be reduced by 26 million due to the expiration of statutes of limitation for various federal and state tax issues in the next 12 months 

 

accounting pronouncements adopted 

 

in the third quarter of 2009 we adopted the financial accounting standards board “fasb” asc the asc does not alter current us gaap but rather integrates existing accounting standards with other authoritative guidance the asc provides a single source of authoritative us gaap for nongovernmental entities and supersedes all other previously issued nonsec accounting and reporting guidance the adoption of the asc did not have any effect on our results of operations or financial position all prior references to us gaap have been revised to conform to the asc updates to the asc are issued in the form of accounting standards updates “asu” 

 

in may 2009 we adopted asc 855 formerly statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 165 subsequent events which establishes general standards of accounting for and disclosure of subsequent events that occur after the balance sheet date the company has evaluated subsequent events through the date of issuance of these financial statements 

 

in april 2009 asc 8201065 formerly sfas 1574 “determining fair value when market activity has decreased” asc 3201065 formerly fsp 1152 and fsp 1242 “otherthantemporary impairment” and asc 8251065 formerly fsp 1071apb 281 “interim fair value disclosures for financial instruments” were issued these topics impact certain aspects of fair value measurement and related disclosures the provisions of these topics were effective beginning in the second quarter of 2009 the impact of adopting these topics in the second quarter of 2009 did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 

 

effective december 29 2008 teledyne adopted the provisions of asc 80 formerly sfas no 141r “business combinations” this revised guidance establishes principles and requirements for how the acquirer of a business recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree it provides guidance for recognizing and measuring the goodwill acquired in the business combination and determines what information to disclose to enable users of the financial statement to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination it applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december 15 2008 with an exception related to the accounting for valuation allowances on deferred taxes and acquired tax contingencies related to acquisitions completed before the effective date the revised guidance also requires adjustments made after the effective date to valuation allowances for acquired deferred tax assets and income tax positions to be recognized as income tax expense the adoption of the revised guidance effective december 29 2008 did not have a material effect on the company’s consolidated results of operations or financial position for the acquisitions made prior to its adoption for any acquisitions completed after our 2008 fiscal year we expect the revised guidance will have an impact on our consolidated financial statements however the nature and magnitude of the specific effects will depend upon the nature terms and size of the acquisitions if any we consummate in 2009 teledyne acquired assets of a marine sensor product line for an initial payment of 14 million due to the size of the purchase the revised guidance did not have an impact on the consolidated financial statements 

 

effective december 29 2008 the company adopted the provisions of asc 8101065 formerly sfas no 160 “noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements — an amendment of arb no 51” the revised guidance establishes new accounting reporting and disclosure standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary and requires the recognition of a noncontrolling interest as equity in the condensed consolidated financial statements and separate from the 

parents’ equity the revised guidance was applied prospectively as of the beginning of fiscal year 2009 except for the presentation and disclosure requirements which were applied retrospectively for the prior periods presented in connection with the adoption and in compliance with asc 480 formerly emerging issues task force abstracts topic no d98 “classification and measurement of redeemable securities” the company restated the prior year balance sheet to reflect the fair value of the obligation to purchase the remaining shares of odi of 242 million at fiscal yearend 2008 as redeemable noncontrolling interest and classified the amount as mezzanine equity temporary equity on the balance sheet the company also restated the yearend 2008 balance in retained earnings to reflect a corresponding 242 million decrease additionally the company reclassified noncontrolling interests of 41 million related to odi from longterm liabilities at yearend 2008 to redeemable noncontrolling interest on the balance sheet the company also reclassified noncontrolling interests of 11 million related to teledyne energy systems inc from longterm liabilities at yearend 2008 to the noncontrolling interest component of the equity section of the balance sheet in 2009 teledyne purchased all of the remaining 141 minority interest in ocean design inc “odi” for 255 million and now owns 100 of odi see footnote 2 “business combinations” for a discussion of the odi acquisition 

 

in september 2006 and in february 2009 the fasb issued guidelines under asc 820 formerly sfas no 157 “fair value measurements” and related fasb staff positions related to fair value measurements that defines fair value establishes a framework in generally accepted accounting principles for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements the guidelines do not increase the use of fair value measurement and only apply when other guidelines require or permit the fair value measurement of assets and liabilities the implementation of the guidelines for financial assets and financial liabilities effective december 31 2007 and the implementation the guidelines for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities effective december 29 2008 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 

 

asc 820 also establishes a valuation hierarchy for disclosure of the inputs to the valuations used to measure fair value this hierarchy prioritizes the inputs into three broad levels as follows level 1 inputs are quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level 2 inputs are inputs that are observable for an asset or liability either directly or indirectly through corroboration with observable market data and level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs based on a reporting entity’s own assumptions used to measure assets and liabilities at fair value a financial asset or liability’s classification within the hierarchy is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement 

 

safe harbor cautionary statement regarding forwardlooking data 

 

this management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation contains forwardlooking statements as defined in the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 directly and indirectly relating to earnings growth opportunities product sales capital expenditures pension matters stock option compensation expense taxes and strategic plans all statements made in this management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation that are not historical in nature should be considered forwardlooking actual results could differ materially from these forwardlooking statements many factors could change the anticipated results including continuing disruptions in the global economy insurance and credit markets changes in demand for products sold to the defense electronics instrumentation and energy exploration and production commercial aviation semiconductor and communications markets funding continuation and award of government programs continued liquidity of our suppliers and customers including commercial and aviation customers and availability of credit to our suppliers and customers and the availability of valve lifters and the cost of the lifter issue at teledyne continental motors inc increasing fuel costs could negatively affect the markets of our commercial aviation businesses lower oil and natural gas prices could negatively affect our business units that supply the oil and gas industry in addition financial market fluctuations affect the value of our pension assets 

 

global responses to terrorism and other perceived threats increase uncertainties associated with forwardlooking statements about our businesses various responses to terrorism and perceived threats could realign government programs and affect the composition funding or timing of our programs flight restrictions would 

negatively impact the market for general aviation aircraft piston engines and components changes in us government policy could result over time in reductions and realignment in defense or other government spending and further changes in programs in which the company participates including anticipated reductions in the company’s missile defense engineering services and gas centrifuge service module manufacturing programs 

 

the company continues to take action to assure compliance with the internal controls disclosure controls and other requirements of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 while we believe our control systems are effective there are inherent limitations in all control systems and misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and may not be detected 

 

while teledyne’s growth strategy includes possible acquisitions we cannot provide any assurance as to when if or on what terms any acquisitions will be made acquisitions involve various inherent risks such as among others our ability to integrate acquired businesses retain customers and achieve identified financial and operating synergies there are additional risks associated with acquiring owning and operating businesses outside of the united states including those arising from us and foreign government policy changes or actions and exchange rate fluctuations 

 

additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in the forwardlooking statements is contained beginning on page 16 of this form 10k under the caption “risk factors cautionary statements as to forwardlooking statements” forwardlooking statements are generally accompanied by words such as “estimate” “project” “predict” “believes” or “expect” that convey the uncertainty of future events or outcomes we assume no obligation to publicly update or revise any forwardlooking statements whether as a result of new information or otherwise

customers 

 

we have hundreds of customers in the electronics communications aerospace and defense industries no commercial customer accounted for more than 10 of our total sales during 2008 2007 or 2006 

 

approximately 40 41 and 40 of our total sales for 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively were derived from contracts with agencies of and prime contractors to the us government our principal us government customer is the us department of defense these sales represented 29 30 and 30 of our total sales for 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively in 2008 2007 and 2006 our largest program with the us government was the systems engineering and technical assistance contract with the space and missile defense command and it represented 35 43 and 49 of total sales respectively set forth below are sales by our segments to agencies and prime contractors to the us government for the periods presented 

 

us government sales 

 

 

 

as described on pages 17 through 20 there are risks associated with doing business with the us government in 2008 approximately 48 of our us government prime contracts and subcontracts were fixed price type contracts compared to 42 in 2007 and 47 in 2006 under these types of contracts we bear the inherent risk that actual performance cost may exceed the fixed contract price such contracts are typically not subject to renegotiation of profits if we fail to anticipate technical problems estimate costs accurately or control costs during performance additionally us government contracts are subject to termination by the us government at its convenience without identification of any default when contracts are terminated for convenience we typically recover costs incurred or committed settlement expenses and profit on work completed prior to termination we had five us government contracts terminated for convenience in 2008 compared to four in 2007 and two in 2006 

 

our total backlog of confirmed orders was approximately 8428 million at december 28 2008 7072 million at december 30 2007 and 5824 million at december 31 2006 we expect to fulfill 98 of such backlog of confirmed orders during 2009 

 

sales to international customers accounted for approximately 24 of total sales in 2008 compared with 22 in 2007 and 21 in 2006 in 2008 we sold products to customers in over 100 foreign countries 90 percent of our sales to foreign customers were made to customers in 28 foreign countries 

 

sales and marketing 

 

our sales and marketing approach varies by segment and by products within our segments a shared fundamental tenet is the commitment to work closely with our customers to understand their needs with an aim to secure preferred supplier and longerterm relationships 

 

our business segments use a combination of internal sales forces distributors and commissioned sales representatives to market and sell our products and services as part of ongoing acquisition integration efforts 

some of our teledyne instruments companies and other business units have been working to consolidate or share internal sales and servicing efforts 

 

products are also advertised in appropriate trade journals and by means of various websites to promote our products and other capabilities our personnel regularly participate in relevant trade shows and professional associations 

 

many of our government contracts are awarded after a competitive bidding process in which we seek to emphasize our ability to provide superior products and technical solutions in addition to competitive pricing 

 

through teledyne technologies international corp and other subsidiaries the company has established offices in foreign countries to facilitate international sales for various businesses 

 

competition 

 

we believe that technological capabilities and innovation and the ability to invest in the development of new and enhanced products are critical to obtaining and maintaining leadership in our markets and the industries in which we compete although we have certain advantages that we believe help us compete effectively in our markets each of our markets is highly competitive our businesses vigorously compete on the basis of quality product performance and reliability technical expertise price and service many of our competitors have and potential competitors could have greater name recognition a larger installed base of products more extensive engineering manufacturing marketing and distribution capabilities and greater financial technological and personnel resources than we do 

 

research and development 

 

our research and development efforts primarily involve engineering and design related to improving product lines and developing new products and technologies in the same or similar fields we spent a total of 3958 million 3551 million and 3070 million on research and development and bid and proposal costs for 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively customerfunded research and development most of which was attributable to work under contracts with the us government represented approximately 83 of total research and development costs for each of 2008 2007 and 2006 

 

in 2008 approximately 807 of the 656 million in companyfunded research and development and bid and proposal costs were incurred in our electronics and communications businesses we expect the level of companyfunded research and development and bid and proposal costs to be approximately 716 million in 2009 

 

intellectual property 

 

while we own and control various intellectual property rights including patents trade secrets confidential information trademarks trade names and copyrights which in the aggregate are of material importance to our business our management believes that our business as a whole is not materially dependent upon any one intellectual property or related group of such properties we own several hundred active patents and are licensed to use certain patents technology and other intellectual property rights owned and controlled by others similarly other companies are licensed to use certain patents technology and other intellectual property rights owned and controlled by us 

 

patents patent applications and license agreements will expire or terminate over time by operation of law in accordance with their terms or otherwise we do not expect the expiration or termination of these patents patent applications and license agreements to have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

 

employees 

 

our total current workforce consists of approximately 8800 employees the international union of united automobile aerospace and agricultural implement workers of america represents approximately 

240 active employees in mobile alabama under a collective bargaining agreement that expires by its terms on february 20 2010 this union also represents approximately 20 of our active employees in toledo ohio under a collective bargaining agreement that expires by its terms on november 10 2009 we consider our relations with our employees to be good 

 

executive management 

 

teledyne’s executive management includes 

 

 13 

 

 

 

  

dr mehrabian and teledyne have entered into a fourth amended and restated employment agreement dated as of january 21 2009 under the agreement we will employ dr mehrabian as the chairman president and chief executive officer through at least december 31 2010 because 12 months notice of nonrenewal has not been given prior to the expiration of the current term of december 31 2009 the agreement automatically renews for a successive one year unless either party gives the other written notice of its election not to renew at least 12 months before the expiration of the current term or any successive renewal terms if notice is given dr mehrabian would then retire on december 31st of the year following the 12th month after receipt of the notice under the agreement dr mehrabian’s annual base salary is 840000 the agreement provides that dr mehrabian is entitled to participate in teledyne’s annual incentive bonus plan and other executive compensation and benefit programs the agreement provides dr mehrabian with a nonqualified pension arrangement under which teledyne will pay him annually starting six months following his retirement and for a period of 10 years as payments supplemental to any accrued pension under our qualified pension plan an amount equal to 50 of his base compensation as in effect at retirement

 item 1a risk factors tableend  

risk factors cautionary statement as to forwardlooking statements 

 

the following text highlights various risks and uncertainties associated with teledyne these factors could materially affect “forwardlooking statements” within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 that we may from time to time make including forwardlooking statements contained in “item 1 business” and “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” of this form 10k and in teledyne’s 2008 annual report to stockholders it is not possible for management to predict all of such factors and new factors may emerge additionally management cannot assess the impact of each such factor on teledyne or the extent to which any factor or combination of factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forwardlooking statements 

continuing disruptions in the global economy the financial markets the currency markets and the energy markets as well as government responses to these disruptions may adversely impact our business and results of operations 

 

continuing distress in the financial markets has had an adverse impact on the availability of credit and liquidity resources although we do not believe that any lender commitments under our current 590 million credit facility which expires in july 2011 have been adversely affected continued market deterioration however could jeopardize certain counterparty obligations including those of the insurers and financial institutions with which we do business some of our customers may face issues gaining access to sufficient credit which could result in an impairment of their ability to make timely payments to us or a determination to cancel delay or otherwise not purchase our products due to reduced credit availability many of our marine survey customers have been delaying the building of new exploration vessels and also reducing maintenance expenditures on their existing fleet which would adversely affect sales of our geophysical streamer cables and hydrophones lack of availability of consumer credit and the general economic downturn have adversely impacted the market for general aviation aircraft which generally means lower sales of piston engines and related components by us some of our suppliers may also face issues gaining access to sufficient credit to maintain their businesses which could reduce the availability of some components and to the extent such suppliers are single source suppliers could adversely affect our ability to continue to manufacture and sell our products as a result of recent fluctuations in currency markets and the stronger us dollar relative to many other major currencies our products priced in us dollars may be more expensive relative to products of our foreign competitors which could result in lower sales in addition the nondollar denominated earnings of our foreign operations may be lower when reported by us in us dollars a slowdown in economic activity caused by a recession would likely reduce worldwide demand for energy and result in lower oil and natural gas prices which could result in lower sales at our business units that supply the oil and gas industry government responses to these market disruptions such as the approved emergency economic stabilization and stimulus legislation could result in reductions in spending for defense programs and other government programs in which we participate 

 

our pension expenses and the value of our pension assets are affected by factors outside of our control including the performance of plan assets the stock market interest rates and actuarial data 

 

we have a defined benefit pension plan covering most of our employees hired prior to 2004 the value of the combined pension assets is currently less than our accumulated pension benefit obligation given our pension plan’s underfunded status in 2004 we began making required cash contributions to our pension plan in 2008 given the market conditions and the reduction in pension asset values we made additional contributions of 500 million beyond what was required under erisa in february 2009 we made voluntary cash contributions of 800 million and currently anticipate making additional contributions of about 371 million during the year for 2008 2007 and 2006 cash contributions totaled 587 million 75 million and 209 million respectively the lower contribution level in 2007 is due primarily to the merger into our pension plan of the overfunded rockwell scientific company pension plan in september 2006 which was part of our september 2006 acquisition of rockwell scientific company the accounting rules applicable to our pension plan require that amounts recognized in the financial statements be determined on an actuarial basis rather than as contributions are made to the plan two significant elements in determining our pension income or pension expense are the expected return on plan assets and the discount rate used in projecting pension benefit obligations declines in the stock market and lower rates of return could increase required contributions to our pension plan any decreases or increases in market interest rates will affect the discount rate assumption used in projecting pension benefit obligations if and to the extent decreases are not offset by contributions and asset returns our cash contributions and sfas no 87 expense could increase under the plans for additional discussion of pension matters see the discussion under “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition” and notes 2 and 12 to notes to consolidated financial statements at the end of 2007 we changed some investment allocations to reduce exposure to deterioration in the subprime mortgage market in 2008 given market disruptions and volatility we maintained a greater amount in fixed income investments including in us treasury notes to achieve some stability in our pension assets however our investment strategy may not be successful if problems in the credit financial 

and stock markets persist due to timing of investment allocation changes we also may not benefit from any upswings in certain investments 

 

we sell products and services to customers in industries that are cyclical and sensitive to changes in general economic activity 

 

we develop and manufacture products for customers in the energy exploration and production markets each of which has been cyclical and suffered from fluctuating market demands strong demand and increased prices for oil and natural gas contributed to substantial revenue growth at teledyne geophysical instruments odi and other members of our marine group a cyclical downturn in these markets may materially affect future operating results particularly given our broader range of marine instrumentation businesses acquired since 2003 

 

domestic and international commercial aerospace markets are cyclical in nature historic demand for new commercial aircraft has been related to the stability and health of domestic and international economies as a result of economic conditions and significant tightening of the credit markets it may be difficult for the commercial airlines and aircraft leasing companies to obtain credit to buy new airplanes delays or changes in aircraft and component orders could impact the future demand for our teledyne controls and other products and have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

 

many of the oem customers of our aerospace engines and components segment are privatelyheld and may not be wellcapitalized in 2007 one of the airplane manufacturer customers of teledyne continental motors filed a petition for bankruptcy resulting in a 17 million write down of our accounts receivable in february 2008 adam aircraft filed for bankruptcy protection while at the time of filing we had no unpaid receivables from adam aircraft we recently had to pay back a small amount to the bankruptcy administrator due to the purported preferential timing of payments from adam aircraft to us any future credit problems with our customers could result in similar or larger write downs or reimbursements and have a material adverse effect on the business results of operations and financial condition of our aerospace engines and components segment 

 

some of our businesses are also suppliers to the semiconductor industry which is highly cyclical by nature the semiconductor industry has experienced significant and sometimes prolonged downturns any downturn in the semiconductor industry or any other industry that uses a significant number of semiconductor devices such as consumer electronic products telecommunication devices or computing devices could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results 

 

in addition we sell products and services to customers in industries that are sensitive to the level of general economic activity and consumer spending habits and in mature industries that are sensitive to capacity adverse economic conditions affecting these industries may reduce demand for our products and services which may reduce our profits or our production levels or both some of our businesses serve industries such as power generation and petrochemical refining which may be negatively impacted by reductions in global capital expenditures and manufacturing capacity 

 

our dependence on revenue from government contracts subjects us to many risks 

 

our revenue from government contracts depends on the continued availability of funding from the us government and accordingly we have the risk that funding for our existing contracts may be diverted to other uses or delayed 

 

we perform work on a number of contracts with the department of defense and other agencies and departments of the us government including subcontracts with government prime contractors sales under contracts with the us government as a whole including sales under contracts with the department of defense as prime contractor or subcontractor represented approximately 40 of our total revenue for 2008 as compared to 41 and 40 of our total revenue for 2007 and 2006 respectively performance under government contracts has certain inherent risks that could have a material effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

government contracts are conditioned upon the continuing availability of congressional appropriations congress typically appropriates funds for a given program on a fiscalyear basis even though contract performance may take more than one year as a result at the beginning of a major program a contract is typically only partially funded and additional monies are normally committed to the contract by the procuring agency only as congress makes appropriations available for future fiscal years the timing of program cycles can also affect our results of operations for a particular quarter or year it is not uncommon for the department of defense to delay the timing of awards for major programs for six to twelve months or more beyond the original anticipated timeframe 

 

while us defense spending increased as a result of the september 11th terrorist attacks and the war in iraq it is currently expected to moderate and then decline over the next few years the continued war on terrorism and the iraqi and afghanistan situations could result in a diversion of funds from programs in which teledyne participates in addition continued defense spending does not necessarily correlate to continued business for us because not all of the programs in which we participate or have current capabilities may be provided with continued funding further our new president and leadership of the us government could implement over time reductions in defense spending and further changes in programs in which we participate 

 

changes in policy and budget priorities by our new president administration and congress for various defense and nasa programs could impact our engineered systems segment for example changes in national space policy that affect nasa’s budget are likely and we anticipate significant scrutiny of missile defense budgets 

 

our electronics and communications segment provides a variety of products for newer military platforms such as the fa22 and f35 aircraft development and production of these aircraft are very expensive and there is no guarantee that the department of defense as it balances budget priorities will continue to provide funding to manufacture and support these platforms reallocation of funding priorities within the department of defense could also affect repair and spares sales for older military platforms including by way of example sales of our traveling wave tubes for f15 f16 f18 ea6b b52 b1 c130 and u2 aircraft the late 2007 grounding of the air force’s f15 fleet as a result of apparent structural failures resulted in decreased 2008 sales for products we supply to the f15 program 

 

our participation in government programs may decrease or be subject to renegotiation as those programs evolve over time 

 

the relocation to huntsville alabama of the missile defense agency or mda has resulted in the transfer to the mda of certain missions and functions from the us army space and missile defense command or smdc new leadership at the mda is conducting solicitations that could impact support by our engineered systems segment to the agency for example all mda government engineering support services work is now to be recompeted at the conclusion of each existing contract and several major prime contracts under which we perform such services are nearing the end of their respective periods of performance mda is also reconsidering its policy on organizational conflict of interest or oci it is reviewing all oci mitigation plans and may be more restrictive of the risk of successful mitigation which the agency accepts going forward potentially limiting our participation in certain major mda programs such as ground based midcourse defense additionally the general accounting office or gao has issued rulings which favor small businesses interests under multiple award idiq or indefinite deliveryindefinite quantity contracts several of the contracts under which we perform engineering support services for mda are this type and as a result our engineering services business could be significantly impacted 

 

over time and for a variety of reasons programs can evolve and affect the extent of our participation for example teledyne brown engineering’s groundbased midcourse defense “gmd” program has been moving toward the end of the program cycle resulting in declining revenues revenues from this contract in 2006 and 2007 totaled approximately 48 million and 45 million respectively in 2008 revenues related to this program declined to 43 million and are expected to continue to decline in 2009 and 2010 even though teledyne brown engineering remains a major subcontractor this anticipated decline is due to a number of factors including the completion of the current gmd deployment cycle the change in political environment 

which might impact the proposed european gmd defense sites and a possible refocus of mda resources towards ballistic missile defense systems research and development applications 

 

we have been a significant participant in nasa programs traditionally through our engineered systems segment and through teledyne scientific company our current nasa activities focus on the international space station and the james webb space telescope as nasa approaches completion of the international space station and retirement of the space shuttle our engineered systems segment has moved away from its historical role in scientific payload development and integration and toward supporting nasa with concept development engineering services and prototype development for the new ares vehicles for space exploration it is possible that the new president administration and congress will shift funding away from exploration toward other priorities such as earth science and aeronautics such policy and priority changes would likely negatively impact our business 

 

we may not be successful in bidding for future contracts which would reduce our revenues or slow our growth 

 

we obtain many us government prime contracts and subcontracts through the process of competitive bidding we may not be successful in having our bids accepted in addition we may spend substantial amounts of time money and effort including design development and marketing activities required to prepare bids and proposals for contracts that may not be awarded to us 

 

our contracts with the us government are subject to termination rights that could adversely affect us 

 

most of our us government contracts are subject to termination by the us government either at its convenience or upon the default of the contractor even when not expressly included in a us government contract courts have found termination for convenience to be present as a matter of public procurement policy terminationforconvenience provisions provide only for the recovery of costs incurred or committed settlement expenses and profit on work completed prior to termination terminationfordefault clauses impose liability on the contractor for excess costs incurred by the us government in reprocuring undelivered items from another source during 2008 teledyne had five us government contracts terminated for convenience we did not have any of our us government contracts terminated for default during 2008 

 

we may lose money or generate less than expected profits on our fixedprice government contracts and we may lose money if we fail to meet certain prespecified targets in government contracts 

 

there is no guarantee that us government contracts will be profitable a number of our us government prime contracts and subcontracts are fixedprice type contracts 48 in 2008 42 in 2007 and 47 in 2006 under these types of contracts we bear the inherent risk that actual performance cost may exceed the fixed contract price this is particularly true where the contract was awarded and the price finalized in advance of final completion of design under such contracts we must absorb cost overruns notwithstanding the difficulty of estimating all of the costs we will incur in performing these contracts our failure to anticipate technical problems estimate costs accurately or control costs during performance of a fixedprice contract may reduce the profitability of a fixedprice contract or cause a loss we have also experienced some volatility in the pricing of certain raw materials and components underlying our fixed price contracts such contracts are typically not subject to renegotiation of profits if we fail to anticipate technical problems estimate costs accurately or control costs during performance we cannot assure that our contract loss provisions in our financial statements will be adequate to cover all actual future losses we may lose money on some contracts if we fail to meet these estimates 

 

certain fees under some of our us government contracts are linked to meeting specified technical cost andor schedule targets including development or testing deadlines fees may also be influenced or be dependent on the collective efforts and success of other defense contractors over which we had no or limited control 

our business is subject to government contracting regulations and our failure to comply with such laws and regulations could harm our operating results and prospects 

 

we like other government contractors are subject to various audits reviews and investigations including private party “whistleblower” lawsuits relating to our compliance with federal and state laws generally claims arising out of these us government inquiries and voluntary disclosures can be resolved without resorting to litigation however should the business unit or division involved be charged with wrongdoing or should the us government determine that the business unit or division is not a “presently responsible contractor” that business unit or division and conceivably our company as a whole could be temporarily suspended or in the event of a conviction could be debarred for up to three years from receiving new government contracts or governmentapproved subcontracts in addition we could expend substantial amounts in defending against such charges and in damages fines and penalties if such charges are proven or result in negotiated settlements 

 

united states and global responses to terrorism the iraq situation mexican border town violence and nuclear proliferation concerns increase uncertainties with respect to many of our businesses and may adversely affect our business and results of operations 

 

united states’ and global responses to terrorism the iraq situation mexican border town violence and nuclear proliferation concerns increase uncertainties with respect to us and other business and financial markets several factors associated directly or indirectly with terrorism the iraq situation and perceived nuclear threats and responses may adversely affect us the reaction to iran’s continuing desire to explore nuclear capabilities could affect adversely oil prices and some of our businesses 

 

while some of our businesses that provide products or services to the us government experienced greater demand for their products and services as a result of increased us government defense spending various responses could realign government programs and affect the composition funding or timing of our government programs our new president administration and congress could also further affect responses and government programs government spending could shift to the department of defense or homeland security programs in which we may not participate or may not have current capabilities and curtail less pressing nondefense programs in which we do participate including department of energy or nasa programs government spending could also shift towards nondefense programs in which we do not currently participate such as medical research programs of the national institutes of health 

 

air travel declines have occurred after terrorist attacks and heightened security alerts as well as after the sars and bird flu scares additional declines in air travel resulting from such factors and other factors could adversely affect the financial condition of many of our commercial airline and aircraft manufacturer customers and in turn could adversely affect our electronics and communications segment 

 

deterioration of financial performance of airlines could result in a reduction of discretionary spending for upgrades of avionics and inflight communications equipment which would adversely affect our electronics and communications segment 

 

the government continues to evaluate potential security issues associated with general aviation increased government regulations including but not limited to increased airspace regulations including user fees could lead to an overall decline in air travel and have an adverse affect on our aerospace engines and components and energy  power systems segments as happened after the september 11th terrorist attacks reinstatement of flight restrictions would negatively impact the market for general aviation aircraft piston engines and components of our aerospace engines and components segment and associated products of teledyne battery products potential reductions in the need for general aviation aircraft maintenance as a result of declines in air travel could also adversely affect our aerospace engines and components segment 

 

higher oil prices could reduce general aviation air travel negatively affecting our aerospace engines and components segment higher oil prices could also adversely affect commercial airlinerelated customers of our electronics and communications segment conversely lower oil prices could decrease oil exploration and petrochemical refining activities and hinder our marine and other instrumentation businesses including teledyne geophysical instruments teledyne tss limited teledyne benthos teledyne dg o’brien and 

majorityowned odi as well as some of our other businesses such as teledyne storm products in addition instability in the middle east or other oilproducing regions could adversely affect expansion plans of the oil and gas industry customers of our instrumentation and cable solutions businesses 

 

violence and crime in mexico particularly in border towns where we conduct some manufacturing activities could adversely affect our relays and cable solutions businesses 

 

acquisitions involve inherent risks that may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

 

our growth strategy includes acquisitions acquisitions involve various inherent risks such as 

 

  

while we conduct financial and other due diligence in connection with our acquisitions and generally seek some form of protection including indemnification from a seller and sometimes an escrow of a portion of the purchase price to cover potential issues such acquired companies may have weaknesses or liabilities that are not accurately assessed or brought to our attention at the time of the acquisition further indemnities or escrows may not fully cover such matters particularly matters identified after a closing 

 

we also have acquired several private companies including the recent acquisitions of cormon limited and odom hydrographic systems inc and the assets of webb research corp and demo systems llc private companies generally may not have as formal or comprehensive internal controls and compliance systems in place as public companies while we have required various sellers to take certain compliance actions prior to the closing of an acquisition including making voluntary disclosures under various export control laws and regulations and have sought protections in the purchase agreement for such matters there is no assurance that we have identified all issues or will be fully protected from historic liabilities after acquiring a company notwithstanding preclosing due diligence we have discovered issues that required further action including making voluntary disclosures under various defense and export control laws and regulations 

 

while the products and customer base of the companies we acquired in 2008 are complementary to some of teledyne’s existing businesses there is no assurance that we will achieve all identified financial operating and marketing synergies we may also experience problems that arise in entering new markets through acquisitions in which we may have little or no experience 

 

additionally in 2008 we expanded our united kingdom presence with the acquisitions of tss international limited filtronic defence limited and cormon limited there are additional risks associated with owning and operating businesses internationally including those arising from us and foreign government policy changes or actions and exchange rate fluctuations 

 

in connection with acquisitions we may consolidate one or more acquired facilities with other teledyne facilities to obtain synergies and costsavings for example we have recently combined and relocated with minimal disruption the operations of the 2008acquired teledyne impulse and longtime owned teledyne interconnect devices to a new leased facility in san diego ca in 2009 we plan to consolidate the 

2008acquired moorpark cabased operations and assets of demo systems llc principally with teledyne controls el segundo ca we also plan to relocate the principal operations of both 2008acquired teledyne tss limited and teledyne cormon limited to more modern and larger facilities close to their current locations nonetheless despite planning relocation and consolidation of manufacturing operations has inherent risks as it tends to involve among other things change of personnel application of a new business system software and learning or adaptation of manufacturing processes and techniques as a result production delays at a new operating location may occur 

 

as permitted by sec rules our current management’s report as to our assessment of the effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting excludes in its scope and coverage our 2008 acquisitions of filtronic defence limited cormon limited and odom hydrographic systems inc and the assets of webb research corp and demo systems llc we plan to evaluate more fully the internal controls of such companies and subsequently acquired companies and implement a formal and rigorous system of internal controls at those acquired companies we can provide no assurance that we will be able to provide a report that contains no significant deficiencies or material weaknesses with respect to these acquired companies or other acquisitions 

 

our future financial results could be adversely impacted by asset impairment charges 

 

under statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” we are required to test both acquired goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis based upon a fair value approach rather than amortizing them over time we have chosen to perform our annual impairment reviews of goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year we also are required to test goodwill for impairment between annual tests if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce our enterprise fair value below its book value these events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate including a significant sustained decline in an entity’s market value legal factors operating performance indicators competition sale or disposition of a significant portion of the business or other factors if the fair market value is less than the book value of goodwill we could be required to record an impairment charge the valuation of reporting units requires judgment in estimating future cash flows discount rates and estimated product life cycles in making these judgments we evaluate the financial health of the business including such factors as industry performance changes in technology and operating cash flows as we have grown through acquisitions we have accumulated 5025 million of goodwill and have 1170 million of acquired intangible assets which includes 301 million of indefinitelived intangible assets out of total assets of 15345 million at december 28 2008 as a result the amount of any annual or interim impairment could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our reported financial results for the period in which the charge is taken we also may be required to record an earnings charge or incur unanticipated expenses if as a result of a change in strategy or other reason we determined the value of other assets has been impaired 

 

we account for the impairment of longlived assets to be held and used in accordance with sfas no 144 “accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets” “sfas no 144” sfas no 144 requires that a longlived asset to be disposed of be reported at the lower of its carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell an asset other than goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets is considered impaired when estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset in the event the carrying amount of such asset is not deemed recoverable the asset is adjusted to its estimated fair value fair value is generally determined based upon estimated discounted future cash flows 

 

we may not have sufficient resources to fund all future research and development and capital expenditures or possible acquisitions 

 

in order to remain competitive we must make substantial investments in research and development of new or enhanced products and continuously upgrade our process technology and manufacturing capabilities although we believe that anticipated cash flows from operations and available borrowings under our 5900 million credit facility will be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated working capital research and development and capital investment needs we may be unable to fund all of these needs or possible 

acquisitions our ability to raise additional capital will depend on a variety of factors some of which will not be within our control including the existence of a public offering market investor perceptions of us our businesses and the industries in which we operate and general economic conditions we may be unable to successfully raise additional capital if needed failure to successfully raise needed capital on a timely or costeffective basis could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

 

our indebtedness could materially and adversely affect our business 

 

as of december 28 2008 we had 3332 million in total outstanding indebtedness including 3260 million under our 5900 million credit facility on february 24 2009 we had 4036 million outstanding under our 5900 million credit facility our indebtedness could harm our business by among other things reducing the funds available to make new strategic acquisitions our indebtedness could also have a material adverse effect on our business by increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions or a downturn in our business general adverse economic and industry conditions or a downturn in our business could result in our inability to repay this indebtedness in a timely manner 

 

we may be unsuccessful in our efforts to increase our participation in certain new markets 

 

we intend to both adapt our existing technologies and develop new products to expand into new market segments for example we continue to work towards developing new fuel cell related technologies the market for fuel cell technologies is not well established and there are a number of companies that have announced intentions to develop and market fuel cell products some of these companies have greater financial andor technological resources than we do 

 

we have also been developing new electronic products including highpower millimeter traveling wave tubes and imaging sonar systems which are intended to access markets in which teledyne does not currently participate or has limited participation we may be unsuccessful in accessing these and other new markets if our products do not meet our customers’ requirements as a result of changes in either technology and industry standards or because of actions taken by our competitors 

 

limitations in funding for applied research and development and technology insertion projects due to the present economic downturn and the significant expenditures in iraq and afghanistan may reduce our ability to apply our ongoing investments in nascent market areas for example our engineered systems segment’s development of service oriented architectures for department of defense applications relies heavily on funding from customers who are actively competing for resources with war driven recapitalization resupply and modernization requirements 

 

our engineered systems segment is also actively pursuing engineered systems work and associated manufacturing opportunities in support of the aviation refurbishment market that is driven by ongoing global conflict limitations on capital investment for facilities andor equipment would reduce the likelihood of significant penetration into this market area 

 

as discussed elsewhere herein there has been a deterioration in the general aviation market as a direct result of the current economic and credit conditions plaguing the united states and the world generally in addition to our aerospace engines and components segment as previously stated this deterioration could impact battery sales of our energy and power systems segment while we will try to offset such impact with potential battery sales to the military and in other ways we may not be able to offset any such impact 

 

we may be unable to successfully introduce new and enhanced products in a timely and costeffective manner which could harm our growth and prospects 

 

our operating results depend in part on our ability to introduce new and enhanced products on a timely basis successful product development and introduction depend on numerous factors including our ability to anticipate customer and market requirements changes in technology and industry standards our ability to differentiate our offerings from offerings of our competitors and market acceptance we may not be able to 

develop and introduce new or enhanced products in a timely and costeffective manner or to develop and introduce products that satisfy customer requirements for example sales of our total organic carbon or toc laboratory instruments have been adversely affected by enhanced products of several competitors 

 

our new products also may not achieve market acceptance or correctly anticipate new industry standards and technological changes as an example we have been working to develop high power solid state power amplifiers which could replace our traveling wave tubes in some applications and in this area there is a larger base of potential competitors than for tube amplifiers as a result it may be more difficult for our solid state power amplifier products to gain market acceptance we may also lose any technological advantage to competitors if we fail to develop new products in a timely manner for example if teledyne continental motors fails to fully launch aerosance’s powerlink fadec its electronic engine control product competitors may be able to introduce similar products that are able to gain market acceptance to the disadvantage of teledyne’s product however in today’s economy general aviation aircraft owners may disregard technological advancements for upfront costssavings and determine that they do yet need such electronic engine controls 

 

additionally new products may trigger increased warranty costs as such products are tested further by actual usage accelerated entry of new products to meet heightened market demand and competitive pressures may cause additional warranty costs as development and testing time periods might be condensed in 2009 for example teledyne energy systems inc currently believes it will continue to incur additional warranty costs as it continues to roll out two new hydrogen generation product lines 

 

technological change and evolving industry and regulatory standards could cause certain of our products or services to become obsolete or noncompetitive 

 

the markets for a number of our products and services are generally characterized by rapid technological development evolving industry standards changes in customer requirements and new product introductions and enhancements a faster than anticipated change in one or more of the technologies related to our products or services or in market demand for products or services based on a particular technology could result in faster than anticipated obsolescence of certain of our products or services and could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition for example teledyne reynolds’ high voltage connector business could be negatively impacted by marketplace shifts to lower voltage requirements where the number of competitors is larger most lighting displays in legacy aircraft use tubes that require high voltage connectors led backlights which are increasingly being used for aircraft lighting displays have substantially lower voltage requirements 

 

currently accepted industry and regulatory standards are also subject to change which may contribute to the obsolescence of our products or services for example a european directive that certain electronic products must not contain impermissible levels of lead mercury cadmium hexavalent chromium polybrominated biphenyls or polybrominated diphenyl ethers took effect on july 1 2006 as a result we must make sure that certain of our electronic products sold into european member states comply with this new directive although many of our products are exempt from the european directive we expect that over time component manufacturers may discontinue selling components that have the restricted substances this will in turn require us to accommodate changes in parameters such as the way parts are soldered and may in some cases require redesign of certain products this could lead to increased costs which we may not be able to recover from our customers delays in product shipments and loss of market share to competitors our sales of environmental monitoring equipment could be negatively impacted if regulatory requirements change to deemphasize environmental monitoring similarly revenues of our teledyne test services business which provides testing and certification for products used in nuclear power plants could be negatively impacted in the event of any changes in certification standards by the nuclear regulatory commission additionally the us environmental protection agency has targeted general aviation fuel as a key contributor to lead in the atmosphere and could try to impose leadfree fuel regulations on general aviation such a change in the fuel standard could have an adverse impact on sales of our aerospace engines and components segment and also require a significant investment in engine research and development 

we may not be able to reduce the costs of our products to satisfy customers’ cost reduction mandates which could harm our sales or margins 

 

given the current economic situation more and more customers are seeking price reductions of our products while we continually try to reduce our manufacturing and other costs of our products without affecting product quality and reliability there is no assurance that we will be able to do so and do so in a timely manner to satisfy the pricing pressures of our customers cost reductions of raw materials and other components used in our products may be beyond our control depending on market credit and economic conditions customers may seek lower cost products from china and other developing countries where manufacturing costs are already lower 

 

the airline industry is heavily regulated and if we fail to comply with applicable requirements our results of operations could suffer 

 

governmental agencies throughout the world including the us federal aviation administration or the faa prescribe standards and qualification requirements for aircraft components including virtually all commercial airline and general aviation products as well as regulations regarding the repair and overhaul of aircraft engines specific regulations vary from country to country although compliance with faa requirements generally satisfies regulatory requirements in other countries we include with the products and replacement parts that we sell to our aircraft manufacturing industry customers documentation certifying that each part complies with applicable regulatory requirements and meets applicable standards of airworthiness established by the faa or the equivalent regulatory agencies in other countries in order to sell our products we and the products we manufacture must also be certified by our individual original equipment manufacturer or oem customers if any material authorization or approval qualifying us to supply our products is revoked or suspended then the sale of the subject product would be prohibited by law which would have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

from time to time the faa or equivalent regulatory agencies in other countries propose new regulations or changes to existing regulations which are usually more stringent than existing regulations if these proposed regulations are adopted and enacted we may incur significant additional costs to achieve compliance which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

product liability claims product recalls and field service actions could have a material adverse effect on our reputation business results of operations and financial condition 

 

as a manufacturer and distributor of a wide variety of products including aircraft engines and medical devices our results of operations are susceptible to adverse publicity regarding the quality or safety of our products in part product liability claims challenging the safety of our products may result in a decline in sales for a particular product which could adversely affect our results of operations this could be the case even if the claims themselves are proven untrue or settled for immaterial amounts 

 

while we have general liability and other insurance policies concerning product liabilities we have selfinsured retentions or deductibles under such policies with respect to a portion of these liabilities for example our current annual selfinsured retention for general aviation aircraft liabilities incurred in connection with products manufactured by teledyne continental motors inc is approximately 201 million a decrease from 210 million for the prior annual period our existing aircraft product liability insurance policy expires on may 31 2009 additionally based on facts and circumstances of claims we have not always accrued amounts up to the applicable annual selfinsured retentions awarded damages could be more than our accruals 

 

product recalls can be expensive and tarnish our reputation and have a material adverse effect on the sales of our products in february 2009 teledyne continental motors commenced a voluntary recall of certain aircraft piston engine cylinders produced since november 2007 we recorded a pretax charge of 180 million during the fourth quarter of 2008 to cover estimated costs related to the recall and replacement of affected cylinders in 2000 teledyne continental motors engaged in a product recall of piston engine crankshafts as a result of which we recorded a 120 million pretax charge in the second quarter of 2000 

through aerosance inc we have developed electronic controls known as powerlink fadec for piston aircraft engines that automate many functions requiring manual control such as fuel flow and power management while such control systems should improve engine management and facilitate maintenance of engines we could face additional claims as they become standard equipment on selected new piston engine aircraft or are retrofitted on some piston engine aircraft new products can trigger additional product liability claims as such products are further tested by actual usage additionally general aviation aircraft crash lawsuits tend to name as defendants manufacturers of a multitude of aircraftrelated products as discovery and recoveries are pursued 

 

we have been joined among a number of defendants often over 100 in lawsuits alleging injury or death as a result of exposure to asbestos we have not incurred material liabilities in connection with these lawsuits the filings typically do not identify any of our products as a source of asbestos exposure and we have been dismissed from cases for lack of product identification but only after some defense costs have been incurred also because of the prominent “teledyne” name we may be mistakenly joined in lawsuits involving a company or business that was not assumed by us as part of our 1999 spinoff our historic insurance coverage including that of its predecessors may not fully cover such claims and defense of such matters as coverage depends on the year of purported exposure and other factors nonetheless we intend to defend these claims vigorously congress from time to time has considered tort reform to deal with asbestosrelated claims but to date nothing has materialized 

 

certain gas generators manufactured by teledyne energy systems inc contain a sealed wetted asbestos component while the company has been transitioning to a replacement material has placed warning labels on its products and takes care in handling of this material by employees there is no assurance that the company will not face product liability claims involving this component 

 

our teledyne brown engineering’s laboratory in knoxville tennessee performs radiological analyses while the laboratory is certified by the department of energy and the nuclear procurement issues committee also known as nupic and has other nuclearrelated certifications and internal quality controls in place errors and omissions in analyses may occur we currently have errors and omissions insurance coverage and nuclear liability insurance coverage that might apply depending on the circumstances we also have sought indemnities from some of our customers our insurance coverage or indemnities however may not be adequate to cover potential problems associated with faulty radiological analyses 

 

we cannot assure that we will not have additional product liability claims or that we will not recall any additional products 

 

we may have difficulty obtaining product liability and other insurance coverages or be subject to increased costs for such coverage 

 

as a manufacturer of a variety of products including aircraft engines used in general aviation aircraft we have general liability and other insurance policies that provide coverage beyond selfinsured retentions or deductibles we cannot assure that for 2009 and in future years insurance carriers will be willing to renew coverage or provide new coverage for product liability especially as it relates to general aviation over the last several years the number of insurance companies providing general aviation product liability insurance coverage has decreased if such insurance is available we may be required to pay substantially higher prices for coverage andor increase our levels of selfinsured retentions or reserves our current aircraft product liability insurance policy expires in may 2009 and has an annual selfinsured retention of approximately 201 million 

 

to offset aircraft product liability insurance costs we continue to try to reduce manufacturing and other costs and also to pass on such insurance costs through price increases on its aircraft engines and spare parts we cannot provide assurances that further cost reduction efforts will prove successful or that customers will accept additional price increases aircraft engines and spare part cost increases coupled with increased costs of insurance for general aviation aircraft owners tend to result in decreasing aftermarket sales of our piston engines and component parts this in turn leaves our aerospace engines and components segment more dependent on sales to oems which is more dependent on general economic conditions 

for certain electronic components for medical applications that we manufacture such as those that go into cardiac defibrillators we have asked for indemnities from our customers andor to be included under their insurance policies we cannot however provide any assurance that such indemnities or insurance will offset potential liabilities that we may incur as a result of our manufacture of such components 

 

aside from the uncertainties created by external events that can affect insurance coverages such as the american international group inc 2008 failure and bailout the devastating 2005 hurricane season or september 11th events our ability to obtain product liability insurance and the cost for such insurance are affected by our historical claims experience while we have taken steps to improve our claims management process over the last few years we cannot assure that for 2009 and in future years our ability to obtain insurance or the cost for such insurance or the amount of selfinsured retentions or reserves will not be negatively impacted by our experience in prior years 

 

increasing competition could reduce the demand for our products and services 

 

although we believe that we have certain advantages that help us compete in our markets each of our markets is highly competitive many of our competitors have and potential competitors could have greater name recognition a larger installed base of products more extensive engineering manufacturing marketing and distribution capabilities and greater financial technological and personnel resources than we do new or existing competitors may also develop new technologies that could adversely affect the demand for our products and services industry consolidation trends particularly among aerospace and defense contractors could adversely affect demand for our products and services if prime contractors seek to control more aspects of vertically integrated projects for example the combination of the network activities of nokia and siemens negatively impacted our wireless transceivers business lowcost competition from china and other developing countries could also result in decreased demand for our products 

 

we sell products to customers in industries that may undergo rapid and unpredictable changes which could adversely affect our operations results or production levels 

 

we develop and manufacture products for customers in industries that have undergone rapid changes in the past for example we manufacture products and provide manufacturing services to companies that serve telecommunications markets during 2001 many segments of the telecommunications market experienced a dramatic and rapid downturn that resulted in cancellations or deferrals of orders for our products and services this market or others that we serve may exhibit rapid changes in the future and may adversely affect our operating results or our production levels or both we also manufacture products using fuel cell technology which is a market that is not well established and subject to significant change and evolution 

 

our engineered systems segment would be severely impacted if united states enrichment corporation “usec” were unable to continue the american centrifuge project as planned usec is the ultimate customer for the gas centrifuge service modules being manufactured by us usec has been anticipating approval of about 2 billion in us government loan guarantees through the department of energy to secure the balance of funding required to complete the american centrifuge project failure to secure such guarantees would seriously jeopardize usec’s ability to finance and therefore complete the project 

 

we are subject to the risks associated with international sales 

 

during 2008 sales to international customers accounted for approximately 24 of our total revenues as compared to 22 in 2007 and 21 in 2006 we anticipate that future sales to international customers will continue to account for a significant percentage of our revenues risks associated with these sales include 

 

 27 

 

  

any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition exchange rate fluctuations may negatively affect the cost of our products to international customers and therefore reduce our competitive position if the us dollar continues to strengthen against the british pound sterling or euro our european customers may no longer find our product prices more attractive than european competitors 

 

sales of our products and services internationally are subject to us and local government regulations and procurement policies and practices including regulations relating to importexport control violations of export control rules could result in suspension of our ability to export items from one or more business units or the entire corporation depending on the scope of the suspension this could have a material effect on our ability to perform certain international contracts concerns over theft of technology for military uses nuclear proliferation concerns terrorism and other factors have resulted in increased export scrutiny of international sales including some of our products to international customers there has also been increasing export oversight and regulation of sales to china travel restrictions to middle eastern and other countries may negatively affect continuing international sales or service revenues from such regions there are also us and international regulations relating to investments exchange controls and repatriation of earnings as well as varying currency political and economic risks 

 

among other things we are subject to the foreign corrupt practices act or fcpa which generally prohibits us companies and their intermediaries from bribing foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or keeping business or otherwise obtaining favorable treatment in particular we may be held liable for actions taken by our strategic or local partners even though our partners are not subject to the fcpa any determination that we have violated the fcpa could result in sanctions that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

compliance with increasing environmental regulations and the effects of potential environmental liabilities could have a material adverse financial effect on us 

 

we like other industry participants are subject to various federal state local and international environmental laws and regulations we may be subject to increasingly stringent environmental standards in the future particularly as climate change initiatives increase in focus future developments administrative actions or liabilities relating to environmental and climate change matters could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

 

while we have as part of our overall risk management program an environmental management and compliance program applicable to our operating facilities including a “review and audit” program to monitor compliance where each facility is reviewed and audited by an internal environmental team every three years such program does not eliminate potential environmental liabilities in addition while we conduct environmentalrelated due diligence in acquisitions and generally seek some form of protection including indemnification from a seller companies we acquire may have environmental liabilities that are not accurately assessed or brought to our attention at the time of the acquisition 

 

for additional discussion of environmental matters see the discussion under the caption “other matters — environmental” of “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of results of operation and financial condition” and note 15 to notes to consolidated financial statements 

 

increased environmental regulatory monitoring requirements of the air we breathe and the water we drink could have a favorable effect on the results of operations or financial condition of our instrumentation businesses including the sulfur dioxide carbon monoxide and ozone gas monitoring business of teledyne advanced pollution instrumentation inc and the water quality monitoring business of teledyne isco inc in contrast the us environmental protection agency’s efforts to limit lead emissions from general aviation 

gasoline could adversely affect our aerospace engines and components segment unless we develop an engine that uses unleaded fuel or diesel fuel 

 

our inability to attract and retain key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our future success 

 

our future success depends to a significant extent upon the continued service of our executive officers and other key management and technical personnel and on our ability to continue to attract retain and motivate qualified personnel recruiting and retaining skilled technical and engineering personnel has become even more competitive as the domestic economy has improved in recent years also our engineered systems segment has already begun to face increasing competition for qualified engineering personnel as a result of the department of defense 2005 base realignment and closure also known as brac decisions particularly as positions continue to move to huntsville alabama over the next several years while we have engaged in succession planning the loss of the services of one or more of our key employees or our failure to attract retain and motivate qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

we may not be able to sell or exit on acceptable terms product lines that we determine no longer meet with our growth strategy 

 

consistent with our growth strategy to focus on markets to expand our profitable niche businesses we continually evaluate our product lines to ensure that they are aligned with our strategy for example after the june 2004 acquisition of isco inc we determined that the online process control instrumentation business of its german subsidiary was not aligned with our strategy and in march 2005 we sold this nonstrategic business in 2007 principally because of the decision of a customer to manufacture certain medical products at its facilities in india we closed our contract manufacturing operations in el rubi mexico and transferred the remaining operations to our la mesa mexico facility and our lewisburg tennessee facility 

 

our ability to dispose of or exit product lines that may no longer be aligned with our growth strategy will depend on many factors including the terms and conditions of any asset purchase and sale agreement as well as industry business and economic conditions we cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to sell nonstrategic product lines on terms that are acceptable to us or at all also if the sale of any nonstrategic product line cannot be consummated or is not practical alternative courses of action including closure may not be available to us or may be more costly than anticipated 

 

provisions of our governing documents applicable law and our change in control severance agreements could make an acquisition of teledyne technologies more difficult 

 

our restated certificate of incorporation amended and restated bylaws and rights agreement and the general corporation law of the state of delaware contain several provisions that could make the acquisition of control of teledyne technologies in a transaction not approved by our board of directors more difficult we have also entered into change in control severance agreements with 16 members of our management which could have an antitakeover effect 

 

the market price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly since our spinoff from ati and could continue to do so 

 

since the spinoff from ati on november 29 1999 the market price of our common stock has ranged from a low of 76875 to a high of 6621 per share during 2008 alone the market price of our common stock ranged from 3390 to 6621 per share at february 24 2009 our closing stock price was 2329 fluctuations in our stock price could continue among the factors that could affect our stock price are 

 

 29 

 

  

the stock markets in general and the markets for high technology companies in particular have experienced a high degree of volatility not necessarily related to the operating performance of these companies we cannot provide assurances as to our stock price 

 

our financial statements are based on estimates required by gaap and actual results may differ materially from those estimated under different assumptions or conditions 

 

our financial statements are prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states these principles require our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period for example estimates are used when accounting for items such as asset valuations allowances for doubtful accounts depreciation and amortization impairment assessments employee benefits taxes recall costs aircraft product and general liability and contingencies while we base our estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances at the time made actual results may differ materially from those estimated 

 

while we believe our control systems are effective there are inherent limitations in all control systems and misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected 

 

we continue to take action to assure compliance with the internal controls disclosure controls and other requirements of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer cannot guarantee that our internal controls and disclosure controls will prevent all possible errors or all fraud a control system no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met in addition the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefit of controls must be relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no system of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within the company have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake further controls can be circumvented by individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more persons or by management override of the controls the design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions over time a control may be inadequate because of changes in conditions or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate because of inherent limitations in a costeffective control system misstatements resulting from error or fraud may occur and may not be detected 

natural disasters such as a serious earthquake or wildfire in california or a major hurricane in alabama or florida could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

 

several of our facilities as a result of their locations could be subject to a catastrophic loss caused by an earthquake a hurricane or a tornado many of our production facilities and our headquarters are located in california and thus are in areas with above average seismic activity and may also be at risk of damage in wildfires in addition we have manufacturing facilities in the southeastern united states and texas that have been threatened and struck by major hurricanes our facilities in alabama florida kansas nebraska and tennessee have also been threatened by tornados in 2007 prior to our acquisition of storm products co a tornado caused minor damage to one of its dallas texas facilities while teledyne continental motors’ pistonengines manufacturing facility and teledyne turbine engines’ advanced manufacturing cell each located in mobile alabama teledyne geophysical instruments’ facility in houston texas odi’s facility in daytona beach florida and teledyne odom’s facility in baton rouge louisiana were relatively fortunate with respect to the building damage and business interruption they suffered during the severe 2005 hurricane season there can be no assurance that any one of them will be as fortunate in the future if any of our california facilities including our california headquarters were to experience a catastrophic earthquake or wildfire loss or if any of our alabama florida louisiana nebraska kansas tennessee or texas facilities were to experience a catastrophic hurricane storm or tornado such event could disrupt our operations delay production shipments and revenue and result in large expenses to repair or replace the facility or facilities while teledyne has property insurance to partially reimburse it for losses caused by windstorm and earth movement such insurance would not cover all possible losses in addition our existing disaster recovery plans including those relating to our information technology systems may not be fully responsive to or minimize losses associated with catastrophic events

our aerospace engines and components segment principally through teledyne continental motors inc focuses on the design development and manufacture of piston engines aftermarket support and electronic engine controls 

 

2008 compared with 2007 

 

our aerospace engines and components segment sales were 1710 million in 2008 compared with sales of 1807 million in 2007 a decrease of 54 the 2008 operating loss was 97 million compared with operating income of 192 million in 2007 we currently expect sales in this segment to decrease further in 2009 

 

sales for 2008 compared with 2007 reflected reduced oem piston engine and spare parts sales the decrease in operating profit in 2008 compared with 2007 reflected an estimated charge of 180 million for product recall and replacement costs the impact of lower sales and higher defense and settlement fees the charge was required to replace certain aircraft piston engine cylinders produced since november 2007 the replacement program should be completed by the end of 2009 operating profit in 2007 included the receipt of a litigation settlement of 14 million net of expenses and the 17 million writedown of accounts receivable related to a customer bankruptcy segment operating profit also included pension expense under sfas no 87 of 06 million in 2008 compared with 07 million for 2007 segment operating profit for 2008 also reflected higher lifo expense of 05 million 

2007 compared with 2006 

 

our aerospace engines and components segment sales were 1807 million in 2007 compared with sales of 1816 million in 2006 a decrease of 05 operating profit was 192 million in 2007 compared with 155 million in 2006 an increase of 239 

 

sales for 2007 compared with 2006 reflected slightly lower oem engine sales the improvement in operating profit in 2007 compared with 2006 reflected the impact of improved operating performance including lower aircraft product liability expense the receipt of a litigation settlement of 14 million net of expenses partially offset by a 17 million writedown of accounts receivable related to a customer bankruptcy segment operating profit for 2006 included the receipt of 25 million pursuant to an agreement that expired in 2006 with honda motor co ltd related to the piston engine business segment operating profit also included pension expense under sfas no 87 of 07 million in 2007 compared with 12 million for 2006 segment operating profit for 2007 also reflected lower lifo expense of 05 million 

 

energy and power systems 

 

 

 

our energy and power systems segment provides hydrogen gas generators thermoelectric and fuel cellbased power sources turbine engines and aviation batteries 

 

2008 compared with 2007 

 

our energy and power systems segment sales were 842 million in 2008 compared with sales of 683 million in 2007 an increase of 233 operating income was 102 million in 2008 compared with 63 million in 2007 an increase of 619 

 

the increase in sales for 2008 compared with 2007 primarily resulted from higher government power systems sales and higher turbine engine sales primarily due to joint airtosurface standoff missile “jassm” engines commercial hydrogen generator sales increased slightly operating profit reflected the impact of higher sales higher margins in the turbine engine business and the reversal of 13 million for environmental reserves no longer needed due to a final settlement 

 

2007 compared with 2006 

 

our energy and power systems segment sales were 683 million in 2007 compared with sales of 692 million in 2006 a decrease of 13 operating income was 63 million in 2007 compared with 60 million in 2006 an increase of 50 

 

the decrease in sales for 2007 compared with 2006 primarily resulted from higher commercial hydrogen generator sales and higher aviation battery sales which were more than offset by lower turbine engine sales operating profit reflected higher margins and sales in the hydrogen generator business which were partially offset by the impact of lower sales and lower margins in the turbine engine business segment operating profit for 2007 also reflected higher lifo expense of 09 million turbine engine sales and operating profit for 2007 were unfavorable compared with 2006 due to lower jassm engine sales partially offset by higher research and development sales 

financial condition liquidity and capital resources 

 

principal capital requirements 

 

our principal capital requirements are to fund working capital needs capital expenditures voluntary and required pension contributions and debt service requirements as well as to fund our stock repurchase program and acquisitions including the purchase of the remaining minority shares of odi which we expect to complete by the third quarter of 2009 it is anticipated that operating cash flow together with available borrowings under the credit facility described below will be sufficient to meet these requirements and could be used to fund some acquisitions in the year 2009 to support acquisitions we may need to raise additional capital our liquidity is not dependent upon the use of offbalance sheet financial arrangements we have no offbalance sheet financing arrangements that incorporate the use of special purpose entities or unconsolidated entities 

 

revolving credit agreement 

 

on february 8 2008 teledyne technologies entered into a first amendment to its amended and restated credit agreement dated as of july 14 2006 the amended and restated credit facility has lender commitments totaling 5900 million and expires on july 14 2011 excluding interest and fees no payments are due under the amended and restated credit facility until it matures the credit agreement requires the company to comply with various financial and operating covenants including maintaining certain consolidated leverage and interest coverage ratios as well as minimum net worth levels and limits on acquired debt at december 28 2008 the company was in compliance with these covenants available borrowing capacity under the 5900 million credit facility which is reduced by borrowings outstanding letters of credit and certain guarantees was 2548 million at december 28 2008 in february 2009 teledyne made a pretax 800 million voluntary contribution to its pension plan funded from its credit facility and cash on hand for a description of some terms of our credit facility see “financing activities” beginning on page 51 

 

contractual obligations 

 

the following table summarizes our expected cash outflows resulting from financial contracts and commitments at december 28 2008 we have not included information on our normal recurring purchases of materials for use in our operations these amounts are generally consistent from year to year closely reflect our levels of production and are not longterm in nature in millions 

 

 

 

 

  

at december 28 2008 the company had a minimum pension plan funding requirement of 138 million for 2009 in february 2009 teledyne made a pretax 800 million voluntary contribution to its pension plan funded primarily from its credit facility the company expects to make an additional contribution to its 

pension plan of 371 million in 2009 based on current assumptions and actual and expected contributions made in 2009 the company would not have a minimum pension plan funding requirement as set forth by erisa in 2010 our minimum funding requirements after 2008 are dependent on several factors as discussed under “accounting for pension plans” in the critical accounting policies section of this management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation estimates beyond 2010 have not been provided due to the significant uncertainty of these amounts which are subject to change until the company’s sfas no 87 assumptions can be updated at the appropriate times in addition certain pension contributions are eligible for future recovery through the pricing of products and services to the us government under certain government contracts therefore the amounts noted are not necessarily indicative of the impact these contributions may have on the company’s liquidity we also have payments due under our other postretirement benefits plans these plans are not required to be funded in advance but are pay as you go see further discussion in note 12 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

 

pursuant to agreements in connection with our august 2006 acquisition of an initial majority interest in odi the odi minority stockholders have the contractual option to sell their shares to teledyne instruments following the end of each quarter through the quarter ended march 31 2009 at a formuladetermined price based principally on odi’s earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda for the twelve months preceding each applicable quarter end all shares not sold to teledyne instruments following the quarter ended march 31 2009 are required to be purchased by teledyne instruments following the quarter ended june 30 2009 at a same formuladetermined price at which time teledyne instruments will own all of the odi shares held by the participating stockholders at december 28 2008 total cash paid including the initial investment and subsequent share purchases for teledyne’s interest in odi net of cash acquired was 738 million based on the formuladetermined purchase price as of the quarter ended december 28 2008 the aggregate amount of funds required to purchase all the shares held by the remaining minority odi stockholders would be approximately 243 million however the actual aggregate amount of funds that we will spend to purchase the shares held by minority stockholders through june 30 2009 could be significantly higher or lower than this amount as that amount will depend on when individual stockholders elect to exercise their put options and on the financial performance of odi teledyne technologies has guaranteed the payment obligation of its subsidiary teledyne instruments 

 

operating activities 

 

in 2008 net cash provided from operations was 1204 million compared with 1667 million in 2007 and 784 million in 2006 

 

the lower net cash provided for 2008 compared with 2007 was primarily due to higher pretax pension contributions of 524 million higher aircraft product defense and settlement payments of 255 million and higher working capital requirements partially offset by higher net income the incremental cash contribution from recent acquisitions and lower income tax payments of 225 million 

 

the higher net cash provided for 2007 compared with 2006 was primarily due to incremental cash contribution from recent acquisitions higher net income higher customer advance payments and deposits improved accounts receivable collections due to timing and 124 million in lower pension contributions 

 

free cash flow cash from operating activities less capital expenditures was 785 million compared with 1264 million in 2007 and 520 million in 2006 

 

 

 

  

working capital 

 

working capital increased to 2813 million at yearend 2008 compared with 2137 million at yearend 2007 the increase in working capital reflects working capital from businesses acquired in fiscal 2008 higher income taxes receivable higher accounts receivable due to increased fourth quarter 2008 sales and higher inventory balances 

 

balance sheet changes 

 

the changes in the following selected components of teledyne’s balance sheet are discussed below in millions 

 

 

 

the higher balances in accounts receivable inventory and shortterm accrued liabilities reflected the impact of organic sales growth as well as businesses acquired in fiscal 2008 the higher balance in shortterm accrued liabilities also includes 158 million in product recall and replacement reserves in 2008 the increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets reflects higher income tax receivables of 196 million longterm deferred income taxes reflected a 785 million increase related to the minimum benefit plan liability adjustment in 2008 the increase in goodwill primarily reflected the acquisitions made in fiscal 2008 the increase in acquired intangible assets primarily reflected the acquisitions made in fiscal 2008 partially offset by current year amortization the increase in longterm debt and capital lease obligations primarily reflected the use of cash flow to purchase businesses and to make pension contributions the accrued pension obligation increased primarily as a result of an increase in the unfunded pension liability in 2008 due in part to lower returns on pension assets partially offset by higher pension contributions the change in the accumulated other comprehensive loss reflected the 1212 million noncash adjustment related to the increase in the unfunded pension liability in 2008 and higher foreign currency translation adjustments 

investing activities 

 

net cash used in investing activities included capital expenditures as presented below 

 

capital expenditures 

 

 

 

during 2009 we plan to invest approximately 450 million in capital expenditures principally to upgrade capital equipment reduce manufacturing costs and introduce new products commitments at december 28 2008 for capital expenditures were approximately 48 million 

 

investing activities used cash for acquisitions of 2851 million 481 million and 2520 million in fiscal 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively see “recent acquisitions” table we received 04 million 08 million and 07 million in 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively from the sale of assets 

 

teledyne funded the acquisitions primarily from borrowings under its credit facility and cash on hand 

 

in all acquisitions the results of operations and cash flows are included in the company’s consolidated financial statements from the date of each respective acquisition each of the companies acquired except for collaborx is part of the electronics and communications segment collaborx is part of the engineered systems segment during 2008 the company completed the process of specifically identifying the amount to be assigned to intangible assets as well as certain assets and liabilities for the storm impulse judson and tss international acquisitions the company is in the process of specifically identifying the amount to be assigned to intangible assets as well as certain assets and liabilities for the webb filtronic cormon odom and demo acquisitions made in fiscal 2008 the company made preliminary estimates as of december 28 2008 since there was insufficient time between the acquisition dates and the end of the period to finalize the valuations 

 

the following table shows the purchase price goodwill acquired and intangible assets acquired for the acquisitions made in fiscal 2008 in millions 

 

 

 

  

except for the storm and demo acquisitions goodwill resulting from the acquisitions made in fiscal 2008 will be deductible for tax purposes

other matters 

 

income taxes 

 

the company’s effective tax rate for 2008 was 369 compared with 341 for 2007 and 340 for 2006 the company completed an analysis of research and development spending for 2000 through 2006 as well as the base period years and anticipates the receipt of income tax refunds for those years the effective tax rate for 2008 reflects the impact of expected research and development income tax credits of 25 million and also reflects the reversal of 08 million in income tax contingency reserves which were determined to be no longer needed due to the expiration of applicable statutes of limitations excluding these items the effective tax rate for 2008 would have been 387 the effective tax rate for 2007 reflects the impact of expected research and development income tax refunds of 44 million and also reflects the reversal of 11 million in income tax contingency reserves which were determined to be no longer needed due to the completion of state tax audits and the expiration of applicable statutes of limitations excluding these items the effective tax rate for 2007 would have been 377 the effective tax rate for the 2006 reflects the impact of the reversal of income tax contingency reserves of 33 million which were determined to be no longer needed due to the expiration of applicable statutes of limitations excluding the impact of the reversal the effective tax rate for 2006 would have been 367 based on the company’s history of operating earnings expectations of future operating earnings and potential tax planning strategies it is more likely than not that the deferred income tax assets at december 28 2008 will be realized 

 

costs and pricing 

 

inflationary trends in recent years have been moderate current inventory costs the increasing costs of equipment and other costs are considered in establishing sales pricing polices the company emphasizes cost containment in all aspects of its business 

 

hedging activities market risk disclosures 

 

we have not entered into any derivative financial instruments such as futures contracts options and swaps forward foreign exchange contracts or interest rate swaps and futures during 2008 or 2007 we have no derivative financial instruments outstanding at december 28 2008 we believe that adequate controls are in place to monitor any hedging activities our primary exposure to market risk relates to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates we periodically evaluate these risks and have taken measures to mitigate these risks we own assets and operate facilities in countries that have been politically stable also our foreign risk management objectives are geared towards stabilizing cash flow from the effects of foreign currency fluctuations most of the company’s sales are denominated in us dollars which mitigates the effect 

of exchange rate changes borrowings under our credit facility are at fixed rates that vary with the term and timing of each loan under the facility loans under the facility typically have terms of one two three or six months and the interest rate for each such loan is subject to change if the loan is continued or converted following the applicable maturity date interest rates are also subject to change based on our debt to earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization ratio as of december 28 2008 we had 3260 million in outstanding indebtedness under our amended and restated credit facility a 100 basis point change in interest rates would result in an increase in annual interest expense of approximately 33 million assuming the 3260 million in debt was outstanding for the full year any borrowings under the company’s revolving credit line are based on a fluctuating market interest rate and consequently the fair value of any outstanding debt should not be affected materially by changes in market interest rates overall we believe that our exposure to interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange rate changes is not material to our financial condition or results of operations 

 

related party transactions 

 

our chairman president and chief executive officer is a director of the bank of new york mellon corporation as is one of our other directors the bank of new york mellon corporation is the successor to mellon financial corporation following its merger with the bank of new york in 2007 another of our directors was a former chief executive officer of mellon financial corporation all transactions with the bank of new york mellon corporation and its respective affiliates are effected under normal commercial terms and we believe that our relationships with the bank of new york mellon corporation and its respective affiliates are armslength the bank of new york mellon corporation is one of 13 lenders under our 5900 million credit facility having committed up to 900 million under the facility the bank of new york mellon corporation also provides cash management services serves as trustee for the teledyne technologies incorporated pension plan and through its subsidiaries and affiliates provides asset management and transition management services for the pension plan mellon investor services llc dba bny mellon shareowner services serves as our transfer agent and registrar as well as the agent under our stockholders rights plan and also handles administration of our stock options 

 

environmental 

 

we are subject to various federal state local and international environmental laws and regulations which require that we investigate and remediate the effects of the release or disposal of materials at sites associated with past and present operations these include sites at which teledyne has been identified as a potentially responsible party under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act commonly known as superfund and comparable state laws we are currently involved in the investigation and remediation of a number of sites reserves for environmental investigation and remediation totaled approximately 29 million at december 28 2008 and 44 million at december 30 2007 as investigation and remediation of these sites proceed and new information is received the company expects that accruals will be adjusted to reflect new information based on current information we do not believe that future environmental costs in excess of those already accrued will materially and adversely affect our financial condition or liquidity however resolution of one or more of these environmental matters or future accrual adjustments in any one reporting period could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations for that period 

 

for additional discussion of environmental matters see notes 2 and 15 to the notes to consolidated financial statements 

 

government contracts 

 

we perform work on a number of contracts with the department of defense and other agencies and departments of the us government including subcontracts with government prime contractors sales under these contracts with the us government which included contracts with the department of defense were approximately 40 of total sales in 2008 41 of total sales in 2007 and 40 of total sales in 2006 for a summary of sales to the us government by segment see note 13 to the notes to consolidated financial 

statements sales to the department of defense represented approximately 29 30 and 30 of total sales for 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively 

 

performance under government contracts has certain inherent risks that could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business results of operations and financial condition government contracts are conditioned upon the continuing availability of congressional appropriations which usually occurs on a fiscal year basis even though contract performance may take more than one year see also our government contracts risk factor disclosure beginning at page 17 

 

for information on accounts receivable from the us government see note 5 to the notes to consolidated financial statements 

 

estimates and reserves 

 

our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent liabilities on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including those related to product returns and replacements allowance for doubtful accounts inventories intangible assets income taxes warranty obligations pension and other postretirement benefits longterm contracts environmental workers’ compensation and general liability aircraft product liability employee dental and medical benefits and other contingencies and litigation we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances at the time the results of which form the basis for making our judgments actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions in some cases such differences may be material see “other matters — critical accounting policies” 

 

the following table reflects significant reserves and valuation accounts which are estimates and based on judgments as described above at december 28 2008 and december 30 2007 

 

reserves and valuation accounts a 

 

 

 

 

  

some of the company’s products are subject to specified warranties and the company provides for the estimated cost of product warranties we regularly assess the adequacy of our preexisting warranty liabilities and adjust amounts as necessary based on a review of historic warranty experience with respect to the applicable business or products as well as the length and actual terms of the warranties which are typically 

one year the product warranty reserve is included in current accrued liabilities on the balance sheet changes in the company’s product warranty reserve are as follows in millions 

 

 

 

critical accounting policies 

 

the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with united states generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the notes to the financial statements some of those judgments can be subjective and complex and therefore actual results could differ materially from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions our critical accounting policies are those that are reflective of significant judgment complexity and uncertainty and may potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions we have identified the following as critical accounting policies revenue recognition aircraft product liability reserve accounting for pension plans accounting for business combinations goodwill and other longlived assets and accounting for income taxes for additional discussion of the application of these and other accounting policies see note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

 

revenue recognition 

 

commercial sales and sales from us government fixedprice type contracts are generally recorded as shipments are made or as services are rendered we account for these contracts in accordance with the securities and exchange commissions’ staff accounting bulletin “sab” no 104 “revenue recognition” or other relevant revenue recognition accounting literature occasionally for certain fixedprice type contracts that require substantial performance over a long time period generally one or more years in accordance with the requirements of american institute of certified public accountants statement of position 811 “accounting for performance of constructiontype and certain productiontype contracts” “sop 811” revenues are recorded under the percentageofcompletion method we measure the extent of progress toward completion using the unitsofdelivery method costtocost method or upon attainment of scheduled performance milestones which could be time event or expense driven occasionally invoices are submitted to and paid by the customer under a contractual agreement which has a different time schedule than the related revenue recognition sales under costreimbursement contracts usually from the us government are recorded as allowable costs are incurred and fees are earned 

 

the development of cost of sales percentages used to record costs under certain fixedprice type contracts and fees under certain costreimbursement type contracts requires management’s judgment to make reasonably dependable cost estimates for the design manufacture and delivery of products and services generally over a long time period since certain fixedprice and costreimbursement type contracts extend over a long period of time the impact of revisions in cost and revenue estimates during the progress of work may adjust the current period earnings on a cumulative catchup basis this method recognizes in the current period the cumulative effect of the changes on current and prior quarters for fixedprice contracts if the current contract estimate indicates a loss a provision is made for the total anticipated loss in the period that it becomes evident contract cost and revenue estimates for significant contracts are generally reviewed and reassessed quarterly these types of contracts and estimates are most frequently related to our sales to the us government or sales to other defense contractors for ultimate sale to the us government for our sales to the us government in 2008 2007 and 2006 operating income as a percent of sales did not vary by more than 05 if operating income as a percent of sales to the us government had been higher or lower by 05 in 2008 the company’s operating income would have changed by approximately 47 million 

aircraft product liability reserve 

 

we are currently involved in certain legal proceedings related to aircraft product liability claims we have accrued an estimate for the probable costs for the resolution of these claims at december 28 2008 we have a reserve of 396 million for aircraft product liability claims of which 25 is current this estimate has been developed in consultation with our insurers outside counsel handling our defense in these matters historical experience the number and nature of claims the level of annual selfinsurance retentions past payment history and is based upon an analysis of potential results assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies we do not believe these proceedings will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position it is possible however that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by specific events occurring in the period changes in our assumptions or the effectiveness of our strategies related to these proceedings the company has aircraft and product liability insurance the current annual selfinsurance retention is 201 million compared with 210 million in 2007 if a significant liability claim or combination of claims were identified even taking into account insurance coverage operating profit in a given period could be reduced significantly accruals could be made in a given period for amounts up to our annual selfinsurance retention based on the facts and circumstances of the claims we have not always accrued amounts up to our annual selfinsurance retention also we cannot assure that for 2009 and in future years our ability to obtain insurance or the premiums for such insurance or the amount of our selfinsured retention or reserves will not be negatively impacted by our experience in prior years or other factors our current aircraft product liability insurance policy expires in may 2009 

 

accounting for pension plans 

 

the company accounts for its defined benefit pension plan in accordance with sfas no 87 “employers’ accounting for pensions” and sfas no 158 “employers’ accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans — an amendment of fasb statements no 87 88 106 and 132r” which requires that amounts recognized in financial statements be determined on an actuarial basis rather than as contributions are made to the plan a significant element in determining the company’s pension income or expense is the expected return on plan assets as well as the assumed discount rate on pension liabilities the company has assumed based upon the types of securities the plan assets are invested in and the longterm historical returns of these investments that the longterm expected return on pension assets will be 825 in 2009 and its assumed discount rate will be 625 in 2009 the company longterm expected return on pension assets used in 2008 was 85 and the assumed discount rate used in 2008 was 60 the actual rate of return on pension assets was a negative 282 in 2008 and 25 in 2007 if the actual rate of return on pension assets is above the projection the company may be able to reduce its contributions to the pension trust if the actual rate of return on pension assets is below the projection the company may be required to make additional contributions to the pension trust the company made aftertax contributions of 362 million to its pension benefit plans in 2008 and currently anticipates making an aftertax cash contribution of approximately 711 million to its pension benefit plans in 2009 before recovery from the us government of which an aftertax cash contribution of 486 million was made in february 2009 the assumed longterm rate of return on assets is applied to the marketrelated value of plan assets at the end of the previous year this produces the expected return on plan assets that is included in annual pension income or expense calculation for the current year the cumulative difference between this expected return and the actual return on plan assets is deferred and amortized into pension income or expense over future periods in accordance with the requirements of sfas no 158 at yearend 2008 the company has a 1913 million noncash reduction to stockholders’ equity and a longterm additional liability of 3150 million related to its pension plans at yearend 2007 the company had a 676 million noncash reduction to stockholders’ equity and a longterm additional liability of 1111 million related to its pension plans see note 12 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional pension disclosures 

differences in the discount rate and expected longterm rate of return on assets within the indicated range would have had the following impact on 2008 pension expense

the company accounts for goodwill and purchased intangible assets under sfas no 141 “business combinations” and sfas no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” in all acquisitions the results are generally included in the company’s consolidated financial statements from the date of each respective acquisition business acquisitions are accounted for under the purchase method by assigning the purchase price to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at their fair values and the excess of the purchase price over the amounts assigned is recorded as goodwill purchased intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives adjustments to fair value assessments are recorded to goodwill over the purchase price allocation period generally not longer than twelve months with the exception of certain adjustments related to income tax uncertainties the resolution of which may extend beyond the purchase price allocation period 

 

goodwill and acquired intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized we review goodwill and acquired indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable the company also performs an annual impairment test in the fourth quarter of each year based on the annual impairment test completed in the fourth quarter of 2008 no impairment of goodwill or intangible assets with indefinite lives was indicated the company estimates the fair value of the reporting units which are our four business segments using a discounted cash flow model based on our best estimate of amounts and timing of future revenues and cash flows and our most recent business and strategic plans and compares the estimated fair value to the net book value of the reporting unit including goodwill the development of future revenue and cash flow projections for our business and strategic plan and the annual impairment test involve significant judgments changes in these projections could affect the estimated fair value of certain of the company’s reporting units and could result in a goodwill impairment charge in a future period however a 10 percent decrease in the current fair value estimate of each of the company’s reporting units would not result in a goodwill impairment charge 

 

we monitor the recoverability of the carrying value of our longlived assets an impairment charge is recognized when events and circumstances indicate that the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by an asset including any proceeds from dispositions are less than the carrying value of the asset and the asset’s carrying value is less than its fair value our cash flow estimates are based on historical results adjusted to reflect our best estimate of future market and operating conditions the net carrying value of assets not recoverable is reduced to fair value our estimates of fair value represent our best estimate based on industry trends and reference to market rates and transactions our determination of what constitutes an indication of possible impairment the estimation of future cash flows and the determination of estimated fair value are all significant judgments 

 

accounting for income taxes 

 

income tax expense and deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect management’s assessment of actual future taxes to be paid on items reflected in the financial statements significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes uncertainty exists regarding tax positions taken in previously filed tax returns still under examination and positions expected to be taken in 

future returns deferred tax assets and liabilities arise due to differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and tax carryforwards although we believe our income tax expense and deferred tax assets and liabilities are reasonable no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome will not be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals to the extent that the final tax outcome is different than the amounts recorded such differences will impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made the provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate as well as the related net interest 

 

significant judgment is required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets in assessing the need for a valuation allowance we consider all available evidence including past operating results estimates of future taxable income and the feasibility of tax planning strategies in the event that we change our determination as to the amount of deferred tax assets that can be realized we will adjust our valuation allowance with a corresponding impact to the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made 

 

our effective tax rates differ from the statutory rate primarily due to the tax impact of the research and development tax credits state taxes and tax audit settlements the effective tax rate was 369 341 and 340 in fiscal 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively see new accounting pronouncements adopted and note 11 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for disclosures regarding the adoption of fin no 48 

 

accounting pronouncements adopted 

 

sfas no 159 

 

in february 2007 the fasb issued sfas no 159 “the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities — including an amendment of fasb statement no 115” sfas no 159 permits entities to choose to measure eligible items at fair value at specified election dates and report unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected in earnings at each subsequent reporting date sfas no 159 is effective for fiscal years beginning after november 15 2007 the company adopted sfas no 159 effective december 31 2007 and did not elect the fair value measurement option for any of our financial assets or liabilities 

 

eitf no 073 

 

in june 2007 the fasb ratified eitf no 073 “eitf 073” “accounting for nonrefundable advance payments for goods or services to be used in future research and development activities” eitf 073 requires nonrefundable advance payments for goods and services to be used in future research and development activities to be recorded as an asset and the payments to be expensed when the research and development activities are performed eitf 073 is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2007 the company adopted eitf 073 effective december 31 2007 and it did not have an effect on the company’s consolidated results of operations or financial position 

 

fin no 48 

 

on january 1 2007 teledyne technologies adopted fasb interpretation no 48 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes “fin no 48” fin no 48 prescribes a minimum recognition threshold and measurement methodology that a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements it also provides guidance for derecognition classification interest and penalties accounting in interim periods disclosure and transition as a result of the implementation the company recognized a 02 million increase in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits which were accounted for as a cumulativeeffect adjustment decrease to the beginning balance of retained earnings as of the date of adoption and after the impact of recognizing the increase in the liability noted above the company’s total gross unrecognized tax benefits and related interest totaled 55 million 

the following presents a rollforward of our unrecognized tax benefits in millions 

 

 

 

we recognized interest related to unrecognized tax benefits of 05 million and 03 million within the provision for income taxes in our statements of operations for fiscal year 2008 and 2007 respectively as of december 28 2008 we estimated that the entire balance of unrecognized tax benefits if resolved in our favor would positively impact the effective tax rate and therefore be recognized as additional tax benefits in our income statement 

 

we file income tax returns in the united states federal jurisdiction and in various states and foreign jurisdictions except for refund claims related to credits for research activities the company has substantially concluded on all us federal and california income tax matters for all years through 2004 substantially all other material state and local and foreign income tax matters have been concluded for years through 2003 

 

the company anticipates the total unrecognized tax benefit may be reduced by 15 million due to the expiration of statutes of limitation for various federal and state tax issues in the next 12 months 

 

pending accounting pronouncements 

 

sfas no 141r 

 

in december 2007 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 141r “business combinations” “sfas no 141r” this statement replaces fasb statement no 141 “business combinations” sfas no 141r establishes principles and requirements for how the acquirer of a business recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree the statement also provides guidance for recognizing and measuring the goodwill acquired in the business combination and determines what information to disclose to enable users of the financial statement to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination sfas no 141r applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december 15 2008 and accordingly will not impact the accounting for acquisitions made prior to its adoption except for the accounting for any deferred tax valuation allowances and acquired tax contingencies related to acquisitions completed before the effective date sfas no 141r amends sfas no 109 to require adjustments made after the adoption of sfas no 141r for acquired deferred tax assets and income tax positions to be recognized in the income statement for any acquisitions completed after our 2008 fiscal year we expect sfas no 141r will have an impact on our consolidated financial statements however the nature and magnitude of the specific effects will depend upon the nature terms and size of the acquisitions we consummate 

 

sfas no 160 

 

in december 2007 the fasb issued sfas no 160 “noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements — an amendment of arb no 51” “sfas no 160” sfas no 160 changes the way the consolidated income statement is presented and establishes a single method of accounting for changes in a 

parent’s ownership interest in a subsidiary that does not result in deconsolidation it also requires that a parent recognize a gain or loss in net income when a subsidiary is deconsolidated under the new standard noncontrolling interests are considered equity and are to be reported as an element of stockholders’ equity rather than within the liability section of the balance sheet in addition the current practice of reporting minority interest expense or benefit also will change under the new standard net income will be shown before minority interest income or expense the income statement will include separate disclosure of the attribution of income between the controlling and noncontrolling interests increases and decreases in the noncontrolling ownership interest amount are to be accounted for as equity transactions this statement will be effective for teledyne’s 2009 fiscal year and interim periods within that fiscal year sfas no 160 will be applied prospectively as of the beginning of the fiscal year 2009 except for the presentation and disclosure requirements the presentation and disclosure requirements must be applied retrospectively for all periods presented as of december 28 2008 other longterm liabilities included 52 million for minority interests the company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this statement 

 

sfas no 157 

 

in september 2006 the fasb issued sfas no 157 “fair value measurements” “sfas no 157” which defines fair value establishes a framework in generally accepted accounting principles for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements this standard only applies when other standards require or permit the fair value measurement of assets and liabilities it does not increase the use of fair value measurement sfas no 157 is effective for financial assets and financial liabilities for fiscal years beginning after november 15 2007 in february 2008 the fasb issued fasb staff position 1571 “application of fasb statement no 157 to fasb statement no 13 and other accounting pronouncements that address fair value measurements for purposes of lease classification or measurement under statement 13” “fsp 1571” which removed leasing transactions accounted for under sfas no 13 and related guidance from the scope of sfas no 157 also in february 2008 the fasb issued fsp 1572 “partial deferral of the effective date of statement no 157” “fsp 1572” deferred the effective date of sfas no 157 for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities to fiscal years beginning after november 15 2008 the implementation of sfas no 157 for financial assets and financial liabilities effective december 31 2007 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations the company is currently assessing the impact of sfas no 157 for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities on its consolidated financial position and results of operations 

 

safe harbor cautionary statement regarding forwardlooking data 

 

this management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation contains forwardlooking statements as defined in the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 directly and indirectly relating to earnings growth opportunities capital expenditures pension matters stock option compensation expense taxes and strategic plans all statements made in this management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation that are not historical in nature should be considered forwardlooking actual results could differ materially from these forwardlooking statements many factors including continuing disruptions in the global economy and insurance and credit markets changes in demand for products sold to the defense electronics instrumentation and energy exploration and production commercial aviation semiconductor and communications markets funding continuation and award of government programs continued liquidity of our customers including commercial and military aviation customers and availability of credit to our customers could change the anticipated results increasing fuel costs could negatively affect the markets of our commercial aviation businesses in addition financial market fluctuations affect the value of our pension assets 

 

global responses to terrorism and other perceived threats increase uncertainties associated with forwardlooking statements about our businesses various responses to terrorism and perceived threats could realign government programs and affect the composition funding or timing of our programs flight restrictions would negatively impact the market for general aviation aircraft piston engines and components the new leadership 

of the us government could result over time in reductions in defense spending and further changes in programs in which the company participates 

 

the company continues to take action to assure compliance with the internal controls disclosure controls and other requirements of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 while we believe our control systems are effective there are inherent limitations in all control systems and misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and may not be detected 

 

while teledyne technologies’ growth strategy includes possible acquisitions we cannot provide any assurance as to when if or on what terms any acquisitions will be made acquisitions involve various inherent risks such as among others our ability to integrate acquired businesses retain customers and achieve identified financial and operating synergies there are additional risks associated with acquiring owning and operating businesses outside of the united states including those arising from us and foreign government policy changes or actions and exchange rate fluctuations 

 

additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in the forwardlooking statements is contained beginning on page 15 of this form 10k under the caption “risk factors cautionary statements as to forwardlooking statements” forwardlooking statements are generally accompanied by words such as “estimate” “project” “predict” “believes” or “expect” that convey the uncertainty of future events or outcomes we assume no obligation to publicly update or revise any forwardlooking statements whether as a result of new information or otherwise

customers 

 

we have hundreds of customers in the electronics communications aerospace and defense industries no commercial customer accounted for more than 10 of our total sales during 2007 2006 or 2005 

 

approximately 41 40 and 42 of our total sales for 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively were derived from contracts with agencies of and prime contractors to the us government our principal us government customer is the us department of defense these sales represented 30 30 and 32 of our total sales for 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively in 2007 2006 and 2005 our largest program with the us government was the systems engineering and technical assistance contract with the space and missile defense command and it represented 43 49 and 55 of total sales respectively set forth below are sales by our segments to agencies and prime contractors to the us government for the periods presented 

 

us government sales 

 

 

 

our total backlog of confirmed orders was approximately 7072 million at december 30 2007 5824 million at december 31 2006 and 5219 million at january 1 2006 we expect to fulfill 98 of such backlog of confirmed orders during 2008 

 

sales to international customers accounted for approximately 22 of total sales in 2007 compared with 21 in 2006 and 18 in 2005 in 2007 we sold products to customers in over 100 foreign countries ninety percent of our sales to foreign customers were made to customers in 28 foreign countries 

 

sales and marketing 

 

our sales and marketing approach varies by segment and by products within our segments a shared fundamental tenet is the commitment to work closely with our customers to understand their needs with an aim to secure preferred supplier and longerterm relationships 

 

our business segments use a combination of internal sales forces distributors and commissioned sales representatives to market and sell our products and services as part of ongoing acquisition integration efforts some of our teledyne instruments companies and other business units have been working to consolidate or share internal sales and servicing efforts 

 

products are also advertised in appropriate trade journals and by means of various websites to promote our products and other capabilities our personnel regularly participate in relevant trade shows and professional associations 

 

many of our government contracts are awarded after a competitive bidding process in which we seek to emphasize our ability to provide superior products and technical solutions in addition to competitive pricing 

 

through teledyne technologies international corp and other subsidiaries the company has established offices in foreign countries to facilitate international sales for various businesses 

 

competition 

 

we believe that technological capabilities and innovation and the ability to invest in the development of new and enhanced products are critical to obtaining and maintaining leadership in our markets and the industries in which we compete although we have certain advantages that we believe help us compete effectively in our markets each of our markets is highly competitive our businesses vigorously compete on the basis of quality product performance and reliability technical expertise price and service many of our 

competitors have and potential competitors could have greater name recognition a larger installed base of products more extensive engineering manufacturing marketing and distribution capabilities and greater financial technological and personnel resources than we do 

 

research and development 

 

our research and development efforts primarily involve engineering and design related to improving product lines and developing new products and technologies in the same or similar fields we spent a total of 3551 million 3070 million and 2915 million on research and development and bid and proposal costs for 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively customerfunded research and development most of which was attributable to work under contracts with the us government represented approximately 83 83 and 85 of total research and development costs for 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively 

 

in 2007 approximately 813 of the 597 million in companyfunded research and development and bid and proposal costs were incurred in our electronics and communications businesses we expect the level of companyfunded research and development and bid and proposal costs to be approximately 700 million in 2008 

 

intellectual property 

 

while we own and control various intellectual property rights including patents trade secrets confidential information trademarks trade names and copyrights which in the aggregate are of material importance to our business our management believes that our business as a whole is not materially dependent upon any one intellectual property or related group of such properties we own several hundred active patents and are licensed to use certain patents technology and other intellectual property rights owned and controlled by others similarly other companies are licensed to use certain patents technology and other intellectual property rights owned and controlled by us as part of our acquisition of scientific company in september 2006 we licensed certain intellectual property of the acquired company to rockwell automation and rockwell collins 

 

patents patent applications and license agreements will expire or terminate over time by operation of law in accordance with their terms or otherwise we do not expect the expiration or termination of these patents patent applications and license agreements to have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition

 item 1a risk factors tableend  

risk factors cautionary statement as to forwardlooking statements 

 

the following text highlights various risks and uncertainties associated with teledyne these factors could materially affect “forwardlooking statements” within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 that we may from time to time make including forwardlooking statements contained in “item 1 business” and “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” of this form 10k and in teledyne’s 2007 annual report to stockholders it is not possible for management to predict all of such factors and new factors may emerge additionally management cannot assess the impact of each such factor on teledyne or the extent to which any factor or combination of factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forwardlooking statements 

 

our dependence on revenue from government contracts subjects us to many risks 

 

our revenue from government contracts depends on the continued availability of funding from the us government and accordingly we have the risk that funding for our existing contracts may be diverted to other uses or delayed 

 

we perform work on a number of contracts with the department of defense and other agencies and departments of the us government including subcontracts with government prime contractors sales under contracts with the us government as a whole including sales under contracts with the department of defense as prime contractor or subcontractor represented approximately 41 of our total revenue for 2007 as compared to 40 and 42 of our total revenue for 2006 and 2005 respectively performance under government contracts has certain inherent risks that could have a material effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

 

government contracts are conditioned upon the continuing availability of congressional appropriations congress typically appropriates funds for a given program on a fiscalyear basis even though contract performance may take more than one year as a result at the beginning of a major program a contract is typically only partially funded and additional monies are normally committed to the contract by the procuring 

agency only as congress makes appropriations available for future fiscal years the timing of program cycles can also affect our results of operations for a particular quarter or year it is not uncommon for the department of defense to delay the timing of awards for major programs for six to twelve months or more beyond the original anticipated timeframe 

 

while us defense spending increased as a result of the september 11th terrorist attacks and the war in iraq it is currently expected to continue to moderate over the next few years the continued war on terrorism and the iraqi situation could result in a diversion of funds from programs in which teledyne participates in addition continued defense spending does not necessarily correlate to continued business for us because not all the programs in which we participate or have current capabilities may be provided with continued funding further changes in the leadership of the us government could result over time in reductions in defense spending and further changes in programs in which we participate 

 

our electronics and communications segment provides a variety of products for newer military platforms such as the fa22 and f35 aircraft development and production of these aircraft are very expensive and there is no guarantee that the department of defense as it balances budget priorities will continue to provide funding to manufacture and support these platforms reallocation of funding priorities within the department of defense could also affect repair and spares sales for older military platforms including by way of example sales of our traveling wave tubes for f15 f16 f18 ea6b b52 b1 c130 and u2 aircraft the recent grounding of the air force’s f15 fleet as a result of apparent structural failures could result in decreased orders for products we supply to the f15 program 

 

our participation in government programs may decrease or be subject to renegotiation as those programs evolve over time 

 

the relocation to huntsville alabama of the missile defense agency or mda has resulted in the transfer to the mda of certain missions and functions from the us army space and missile defense command or smdc we understand that work currently performed under one or more existing smdc contracts may be transferred to one or more existing or new mda contracts such transfers may require us to recompete for some work currently performed by us and there is no guarantee that we would maintain historic levels of revenue or profitability if we successfully recompeted or even that mda will effect this transition without a break in contract coverage such changes could affect our engineered systems segment but it is too early to tell the impact of such changes 

 

over time and for a variety of reasons programs can evolve and affect the extent of our participation for example teledyne brown engineering’s groundbased midcourse defense program is moving toward the end of the program cycle resulting in declining revenues revenues from this contract in 2005 and 2006 totaled approximately 51 million and 48 million respectively in 2007 revenues related to this program declined to 45 million and are expected to decline further through 2009 as mda shifts its focus toward integrating the groundbased midcourse defense program into the larger ballistic missile defense program 

 

we have been a significant participant in nasa programs traditionally through our engineered systems segment and through teledyne scientific company the foci of our current nasa activities are the international space station and the james webb space telescope while we anticipate participating in nasa’s lunar and interplanetary exploration activities funding for these activities has been reduced as nasa focuses on the completion of the international space station and on keeping the space shuttle fleet in continuous service each of which is also facing a tightened budget these changes could adversely impact us 

 

we may not be successful in bidding for future contracts 

 

we obtain many us government prime contracts and subcontracts through the process of competitive bidding we may not be successful in having our bids accepted in addition we may spend substantial amounts of time money and effort including design development and marketing activities required to prepare bids and proposals for contracts that may not be awarded to us 

our contracts with the us government are subject to termination rights that could adversely affect us 

 

most of our us government contracts are subject to termination by the us government either at its convenience or upon the default of the contractor terminationforconvenience provisions provide only for the recovery of costs incurred or committed settlement expenses and profit on work completed prior to termination terminationfordefault clauses impose liability on the contractor for excess costs incurred by the us government in reprocuring undelivered items from another source during 2007 teledyne had four us government contracts terminated for convenience we did not have any of our us government contracts terminated for default during 2007 

 

we may lose money or generate less than expected profits on our fixedprice government contracts and we may lose money if we fail to meet certain prespecified targets in government contracts 

 

there is no guarantee that us government contracts will be profitable a number of our us government prime contracts and subcontracts are fixedprice type contracts 42 in 2007 47 in 2006 and 2005 under these types of contracts we bear the inherent risk that actual performance cost may exceed the fixed contract price this is particularly true where the contract was awarded and the price finalized in advance of final completion of design under such contracts we must absorb cost overruns notwithstanding the difficulty of estimating all of the costs we will incur in performing these contracts our failure to anticipate technical problems estimate costs accurately or control costs during performance of a fixedprice contract may reduce the profitability of a fixedprice contract or cause a loss we cannot assure that our contract loss provisions in our financial statements will be adequate to cover all actual future losses we may lose money on some contracts if we fail to meet these targets 

 

certain fees under some of our us government contracts are linked to meeting specified technical cost andor schedule targets including development or testing deadlines fees may also be influenced or be dependent on the collective efforts and success of other defense contractors over which we had no or limited control 

 

our business is subject to government contracting regulations and our failure to comply with such laws and regulations could harm our operating results and prospects 

 

we like other government contractors are subject to various audits reviews and investigations including private party “whistleblower” lawsuits relating to our compliance with federal and state laws generally claims arising out of these us government inquiries and voluntary disclosures can be resolved without resorting to litigation however should the business unit or division involved be charged with wrongdoing or should the us government determine that the unit or division is not a “presently responsible contractor” that unit or division and conceivably our company as a whole could be temporarily suspended or in the event of a conviction could be debarred for up to three years from receiving new government contracts or governmentapproved subcontracts in addition we could expend substantial amounts in defending against such charges and in damages fines and penalties if such charges are proven or result in negotiated settlements 

 

our pension expenses and the value of our pension assets are affected by factors outside of our control including the performance of plan assets the stock market interest rates and actuarial data 

 

we have a defined benefit pension plan covering most of our employees at yearend 2007 the value of the combined pension assets was less than our accumulated pension benefit obligation given our pension plan’s underfunded status in 2004 we began making required cash contributions to our pension plan for 2007 2006 and 2005 cash contributions totaled 75 million 209 million and 155 million respectively and we currently expect such contributions to be approximately 90 million for 2008 the lower contribution level in 2007 is due primarily to the merger into our pension plan of the overfunded scientific company pension plan in september 2006 which was part of our september 2006 acquisition of scientific company the accounting rules applicable to our pension plan require that amounts recognized in financial statements be determined on an actuarial basis rather than as contributions are made to the plan two significant elements in determining our pension income or pension expense are the expected return on plan assets and the discount 

rate used in projecting pension benefit obligations declines in the stock market and lower rates of return could increase required contributions to our pension plan any decreases in market interest rates will affect the discount rate assumption used in projecting pension benefit obligations and therefore if and to the extent these decreases are not offset by contributions and asset returns our obligations could increase under the plans for additional discussion of pension matters see the discussion under “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition” and notes 2 and 12 to notes to consolidated financial statements at the end of 2007 we changed some investment allocations to reduce exposure to deterioration in the subprime mortgage market however our investment strategy may not be successful if the problems in the subprime credit market spread to other types of investments 

 

united states’ and global responses to terrorism the iraq situation and nuclear proliferation concerns increase uncertainties with respect to many of our businesses and may adversely affect our business and results of operations 

 

united states’ and global responses to terrorism the iraq situation and nuclear proliferation concerns increase uncertainties with respect to us and other business and financial markets several factors associated directly or indirectly with terrorism the iraq situation and perceived nuclear threats and responses may adversely affect us the reaction to iran’s continuing desire to explore nuclear capabilities could affect adversely oil prices and some of our businesses 

 

while some of our businesses that provide products or services to the us government experienced greater demand for their products and services as a result of increased us government defense spending various responses could realign government programs and affect the composition funding or timing of our government programs changes in the leadership of the us government could also further affect responses and government programs government spending could shift to the department of defense or homeland security programs in which we may not participate or may not have current capabilities and curtail less pressing nondefense programs in which we do participate including department of energy or nasa programs government spending could also shift towards nondefense programs in which we do not currently participate such as medical research programs of the national institutes of health 

 

air travel declines have occurred after terrorist attacks and heightened security alerts as well as after the sars and bird flu scares additional declines in air travel resulting from such factors and other factors could adversely affect the financial condition of many of our commercial airline and aircraft manufacturer customers and in turn could adversely affect our electronics and communications segment 

 

deterioration of financial performance of airlines could result in a reduction of discretionary spending for upgrades of avionics and inflight communications equipment which would adversely affect our electronics and communications segment 

 

the government continues to evaluate potential security issues associated with general aviation increased government regulations including but not limited to increased airspace regulations including user fees could lead to an overall decline in air travel and have an adverse affect on our aerospace engines and components segment as happened after the september 11th terrorist attacks reinstatement of flight restrictions would negatively impact the market for general aviation aircraft piston engines and components and our aerospace engines and components segment potential reductions in the need for general aviation aircraft maintenance as a result of declines in air travel could also adversely affect our aerospace engines and components segment 

 

higher oil prices could reduce general aviation air travel negatively affecting our aerospace engines and components segment higher oil prices could also adversely affect commercial airlinerelated customers of our electronics and communications segment conversely lower oil prices could decrease oil exploration activities and hinder our marine instrumentation businesses including teledyne geophysical instruments teledyne benthos teledyne dg o’brien and majorityowned odi in addition instability in the middle east or other oilproducing regions could adversely affect expansion plans of the oil and gas industry customers of our marine instrumentation business 

acquisitions involve inherent risks that may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

 

our growth strategy includes acquisitions acquisitions involve various inherent risks such as 

 

  

while we conduct financial and other due diligence in connection with our acquisitions and generally seek some form of protection including indemnification from a seller and sometimes an escrow of a portion of the purchase price to cover potential issues such acquired companies may have weaknesses or liabilities that are not accurately assessed or brought to our attention at the time of the acquisition further indemnities or escrows may not fully cover such matters particularly matters identified after a closing 

 

we also have acquired several private companies including the recent acquisitions of storm products co tss international limited and the assets of impulse enterprise and judson technologies llc private companies generally may not have as formal or comprehensive internal controls and compliance systems in place as public companies while we have required various sellers to take certain compliance actions prior to the closing of an acquisition including making voluntary disclosures under various export control laws and regulations and have sought protections in the purchase agreement for such matters there is no assurance that we have identified all issues or will be fully protected from historic liabilities after acquiring a company notwithstanding preclosing due diligence we have discovered issues that required further action including making voluntary disclosures under various defense and export control laws and regulations 

 

while the products and customer base of the companies we acquired in 2007 are complementary to some of teledyne’s existing businesses there is no assurance that we will achieve all identified financial operating and marketing synergies we may also experience problems that arise in entering new markets through acquisitions in which we may have little or no experience 

 

in connection with acquisitions we may consolidate one or more acquired facilities with other teledyne facilities to obtain synergies and costsavings for example in 2006 we relocated with minimal disruption the operations of the microwave technical solutions assets acquired from avnet inc to a teledyne cougar facility in sunnyvale california in 2007 we also moved 2007acquired tindall technologies inc’s operations into the same teledyne cougar facility on a larger scale in 2006 we successfully consolidated into a newly leased facility in poway california the operations of 2005acquired teledyne rd instruments inc 2005acquired mgd technologies inc now part of teledyne isco and teledyne interconnect devices in 2007 we added 2006acquired teledyne kw microwave to such facility nonetheless despite planning relocation and consolidation of manufacturing operations has inherent risks as it tends to involve among other things change of personnel application of a new business system software and learning or adaptation of manufacturing processes and techniques as a result production delays at a new operating location may occur 

 

as permitted by sec rules our current management’s report as to our assessment of the effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting excludes in its scope and coverage our 2007 acquisition of the assets of dg o’brien inc we plan to evaluate more fully the internal controls of teledyne dg o’brien and subsequently acquired companies and implement a formal and rigorous system of internal controls at those 

acquired companies we can provide no assurance that we will be able to provide a report that contains no significant deficiencies or material weaknesses with respect to these acquired companies or other acquisitions 

 

our future financial results could be adversely impacted by asset impairment charges 

 

under statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” we are required to test both acquired goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis based upon a fair value approach rather than amortizing them over time we have chosen to perform our annual impairment reviews of goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year we also are required to test goodwill for impairment between annual tests if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce our enterprise fair value below its book value these events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate including a significant sustained decline in an entity’s market value legal factors operating performance indicators competition sale or disposition of a significant portion of the business or other factors if the fair market value is less than the book value of goodwill we could be required to record an impairment charge the valuation of reporting units requires judgment in estimating future cash flows discount rates and estimated product life cycles in making these judgments we evaluate the financial health of the business including such factors as industry performance changes in technology and operating cash flows as we have grown through acquisitions we have accumulated 3516 million of goodwill and have 617 million of acquired intangible assets which includes 113 of indefinitelived intangible assets out of total assets of 11594 million at december 30 2007 as a result the amount of any annual or interim impairment could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our reported financial results for the period in which the charge is taken we also may be required to record an earnings charge or incur unanticipated expenses if as a result of a change in strategy or other reason we determined the value of other assets has been impaired 

 

we account for the impairment of longlived assets to be held and used in accordance with sfas no 144 “accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets” “sfas no 144” sfas no 144 requires that a longlived asset to be disposed of be reported at the lower of its carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell an asset other than goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets is considered impaired when estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset in the event the carrying amount of such asset is not deemed recoverable the asset is adjusted to its estimated fair value fair value is generally determined based upon estimated discounted future cash flows 

 

we may not have sufficient resources to fund all future research and development and capital expenditures or possible acquisitions 

 

in order to remain competitive we must make substantial investments in research and development of new or enhanced products and continuously upgrade our process technology and manufacturing capabilities although we believe that anticipated cash flows from operations and available borrowings under our recently amended 5900 million credit facility will be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated working capital research and development and capital investment needs we may be unable to fund all of these needs or possible acquisitions our ability to raise additional capital will depend on a variety of factors some of which will not be within our control including the existence of a public offering market investor perceptions of us our businesses and the industries in which we operate and general economic conditions we may be unable to successfully raise additional capital if needed failure to successfully raise needed capital on a timely or costeffective basis could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

 

our indebtedness could materially and adversely affect our business 

 

as of december 30 2007 we had 1432 million in total outstanding indebtedness including 1380 million under our then 4000 million credit facility the borrowing capacity under our credit facility was subsequently increased to 5900 million in february 2008 our indebtedness could harm our business by among other things reducing the funds available to make new strategic acquisitions our indebtedness could 

also have a material adverse effect on our business by increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions or a downturn in our business general adverse economic and industry conditions or a downturn in our business could result in our inability to repay this indebtedness in a timely manner 

 

we may be unsuccessful in our efforts to increase our participation in certain new markets 

 

we intend to both adapt our existing technologies and develop new products to expand into new market segments for example we continue to work towards developing new fuel cell related technologies the market for fuel cell technologies is not well established and there are a number of companies that have announced intentions to develop and market fuel cell products some of these companies have greater financial andor technological resources than we do 

 

we have also been developing new electronic products including highpower millimeter traveling wave tubes and imaging sonar systems which are intended to access markets in which teledyne does not currently participate or has limited participation we may be unsuccessful in accessing these and other new markets if our products do not meet our customers’ requirements as a result of changes in either technology and industry standards or because of actions taken by our competitors 

 

we may be unable to successfully introduce new and enhanced products in a timely and costeffective manner 

 

our operating results depend in part on our ability to introduce new and enhanced products on a timely basis successful product development and introduction depend on numerous factors including our ability to anticipate customer and market requirements changes in technology and industry standards our ability to differentiate our offerings from offerings of our competitors and market acceptance we may not be able to develop and introduce new or enhanced products in a timely and costeffective manner or to develop and introduce products that satisfy customer requirements our new products also may not achieve market acceptance or correctly anticipate new industry standards and technological changes as an example we have been working to develop high power solid state power amplifiers which could replace our traveling wave tubes in some applications and in this area there is a larger base of potential competitors than for tube amplifiers as a result it may be more difficult for our solid state power amplifier products to gain market acceptance we may also lose any technological advantage to competitors if we fail to develop new products in a timely manner for example if teledyne continental motors fails to fully launch aerosance’s powerlink fadec its electronic engine control product competitors may be able to introduce similar products that are able to gain market acceptance to the disadvantage of teledyne’s product 

 

additionally new products may trigger increased warranty costs as such products are tested further by actual usage accelerated entry of new products to meet heightened market demand and competitive pressures may cause additional warranty costs as development and testing time periods might be condensed in 2008 for example teledyne energy systems inc currently believes it will continue to incur additional warranty costs as it continues to roll out two new hydrogen generation product lines 

 

technological change and evolving industry and regulatory standards could cause certain of our products or services to become obsolete or noncompetitive 

 

the markets for a number of our products and services are generally characterized by rapid technological development evolving industry standards changes in customer requirements and new product introductions and enhancements a faster than anticipated change in one or more of the technologies related to our products or services or in market demand for products or services based on a particular technology could result in faster than anticipated obsolescence of certain of our products or services and could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition for example teledyne reynolds’ high voltage connector business could be negatively impacted by marketplace shifts to lower voltage requirements where the number of competitors is larger most lighting displays in legacy aircraft use tubes that require high voltage connectors led backlights which are increasingly being used for aircraft lighting displays have substantially lower voltage requirements 

currently accepted industry and regulatory standards are also subject to change which may contribute to the obsolescence of our products or services for example a european directive that certain electronic products must not contain impermissible levels of lead mercury cadmium hexavalent chromium polybrominated biphenyls or polybrominated diphenyl ethers recently took effect on july 1 2006 as a result we must make sure that certain of our electronic products sold into european member states comply with this new directive although many of our products are exempt from the european directive we expect that over time component manufacturers may discontinue selling components that have the restricted substances this will in turn require us to accommodate changes in parameters such as the way parts are soldered and may in some cases require redesign of certain products this could lead to increased costs which we may not be able to recover from our customers delays in product shipments and loss of market share to competitors our sales of environmental monitoring equipment could be negatively impacted if regulatory requirements change to deemphasize environmental monitoring similarly revenues of our teledyne test services business which provides testing and certification for products used in nuclear power plants could be negatively impacted in the event of any changes in certification standards by the nuclear regulatory commission 

 

the airline industry is heavily regulated and if we fail to comply with applicable requirements our results of operations could suffer 

 

governmental agencies throughout the world including the us federal aviation administration or the faa prescribe standards and qualification requirements for aircraft components including virtually all commercial airline and general aviation products as well as regulations regarding the repair and overhaul of aircraft engines specific regulations vary from country to country although compliance with faa requirements generally satisfies regulatory requirements in other countries we include with the products and replacement parts that we sell to our aircraft manufacturing industry customers documentation certifying that each part complies with applicable regulatory requirements and meets applicable standards of airworthiness established by the faa or the equivalent regulatory agencies in other countries in order to sell our products we and the products we manufacture must also be certified by our individual original equipment manufacturer or oem customers if any material authorization or approval qualifying us to supply our products is revoked or suspended then the sale of the subject product would be prohibited by law which would have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

from time to time the faa or equivalent regulatory agencies in other countries propose new regulations or changes to existing regulations which are usually more stringent than existing regulations if these proposed regulations are adopted and enacted we may incur significant additional costs to achieve compliance which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

product liability claims product recalls and field service actions could have a material adverse effect on our reputation business results of operations and financial condition 

 

as a manufacturer and distributor of a wide variety of products including aircraft engines and medical devices our results of operations are susceptible to adverse publicity regarding the quality or safety of our products in part product liability claims challenging the safety of our products may result in a decline in sales for a particular product which could adversely affect our results of operations this could be the case even if the claims themselves are proven untrue or settled for immaterial amounts 

 

while we have general liability and other insurance policies concerning product liabilities we have selfinsured retentions or deductibles under such policies with respect to a portion of these liabilities for example our current annual selfinsured retention for general aviation aircraft liabilities incurred in connection with products manufactured by teledyne continental motors inc is approximately 210 million a decrease from 229 million for the prior annual period our existing aircraft product liability insurance policy expires on may 31 2008 additionally based on facts and circumstances of claims we have not always accrued amounts up to the applicable annual selfinsured retentions awarded damages could be more than our accruals 

 

product recalls can be expensive and tarnish our reputation and have a material adverse effect on the sales of our products for example teledyne continental motors had been engaged in a product recall of 

piston engine crankshafts as a result of which we recorded a 120 million pretax charge in the second quarter of 2000 in 2002 we reached a monetary settlement related to the 2000 recall with two of three companies that manufactured and processed allegedly defective steel subsequently made into aircraft engine crankshafts we failed to win a jury verdict against a third company involved in making the steel in 2008 we reached another monetary settlement with a materials supplier as a result of the 2000 product recall program 

 

through aerosance inc we have developed electronic controls known as powerlink fadec for piston aircraft engines that automate many functions requiring manual control such as fuel flow and power management while such control systems should improve engine management and facilitate maintenance of engines we could face additional claims as they become standard equipment on selected new piston engine aircraft or are retrofitted on some piston engine aircraft new products can trigger additional product liability claims as such products are further tested by actual usage additionally general aviation aircraft crash lawsuits tend to name as defendants manufacturers of a multitude of aircraftrelated products as discovery and recoveries are pursued 

 

we have been joined among a number of defendants often over 100 in lawsuits alleging injury or death as a result of exposure to asbestos we have not incurred material liabilities in connection with these lawsuits the filings typically do not identify any of our products as a source of asbestos exposure and we have been dismissed from cases for lack of product identification but only after some defense costs have been incurred also because of the prominent “teledyne” name we may be mistakenly joined in lawsuits involving a company or business that was not assumed by us as part of our 1999 spinoff our historic insurance coverage including that of its predecessors may not fully cover such claims and defense of such matters as coverage depends on the year of purported exposure and other factors nonetheless we intend to defend these claims vigorously congress from time to time has considered tort reform to deal with asbestosrelated claims but to date nothing has materialized 

 

certain gas generators manufactured by teledyne energy systems inc contain a sealed wetted asbestos component while the company has been transitioning to a replacement material has placed warning labels on its products and takes care in handling of this material by employees there is no assurance that the company will not face product liability claims involving this component 

 

our teledyne brown engineering’s laboratory in knoxville tennessee performs radiological analyses while the laboratory is certified by the department of energy and has other nuclearrelated certifications and internal quality controls in place errors and omissions in analyses may occur we currently have errors and omissions insurance coverage and nuclear liability insurance coverage that might apply depending on the circumstances we also have sought indemnities from some of our customers our insurance coverage or indemnities however may not be adequate to cover potential problems associated with faulty radiological analyses 

 

we cannot assure that we will not have additional product liability claims or that we will not recall any additional products 

 

we may have difficulty obtaining product liability and other insurance coverages or be subject to increased costs for such coverage 

 

as a manufacturer of a variety of products including aircraft engines used in general aviation aircraft we have general liability and other insurance policies that provide coverage beyond selfinsured retentions or deductibles we cannot assure that for 2008 and in future years insurance carriers will be willing to renew coverage or provide new coverage for product liability especially as it relates to general aviation over the last several years the number of insurance companies providing general aviation product liability insurance coverage has decreased if such insurance is available we may be required to pay substantially higher prices for coverage andor increase our levels of selfinsured retentions or reserves our current aircraft product liability insurance policy expires in may 2008 and has an annual selfinsured retention of approximately 210 million 

to offset aircraft product liability insurance costs we continue to try to reduce manufacturing and other costs and also to pass on such insurance costs through price increases on its aircraft engines and spare parts we cannot provide assurances that further cost reduction efforts will prove successful or that customers will accept additional price increases aircraft engines and spare part cost increases coupled with increased costs of insurance for general aviation aircraft owners tend to result in decreasing aftermarket sales of our piston engines this in turn leaves our aerospace engines and components segment more dependent on sales to oems which is more dependent on general economic conditions 

 

for certain electronic components for medical applications that we manufacture such as those that go into cardiac defibrillators we have asked for indemnities from our customers andor to be included under their insurance policies we cannot however provide any assurance that such indemnities or insurance will offset potential liabilities that we may incur as a result of our manufacture of such components 

 

aside from the uncertainties created by external events that can affect insurance coverages such as the devastating 2005 hurricane season our ability to obtain product liability insurance and the cost for such insurance are affected by our historical claims experience while we have taken steps to improve our claims management process over the last few years we cannot assure that for 2008 and in future years our ability to obtain insurance or the cost for such insurance or the amount of selfinsured retentions or reserves will not be negatively impacted by our experience in prior years 

 

increasing competition could reduce the demand for our products and services 

 

although we believe that we have certain advantages that help us compete in our markets each of our markets is highly competitive many of our competitors have and potential competitors could have greater name recognition a larger installed base of products more extensive engineering manufacturing marketing and distribution capabilities and greater financial technological and personnel resources than we do new or existing competitors may also develop new technologies that could adversely affect the demand for our products and services industry consolidation trends particularly among aerospace and defense contractors could adversely affect demand for our products and services if prime contractors seek to control more aspects of vertically integrated projects for example the pending combination of the network activities of nokia and siemens could negatively impact our wireless transceivers business our general aviation piston engines business could face increasing competition from germanbased thielert aircraft engines gmbh as it continues to enter the us market with retrofits and attracts oems lowcost competition from china and other developing countries could also result in decreased demand for our products 

 

we sell products and services to customers in industries that are cyclical and sensitive to changes in general economic activity 

 

we develop and manufacture products for customers in the energy exploration market which has been cyclical and suffered from over capacity in prior years strong demand and increased prices for oil and natural gas contributed to substantial revenue growth at teledyne geophysical instruments and odi since 2003 a cyclical downturn in this market may affect future operating results particularly given our broader range of marine instrumentation businesses since 2003 

 

we derive significant revenues from the commercial aerospace industry domestic and international commercial aerospace markets are cyclical in nature historic demand for new commercial aircraft has been related to the stability and health of domestic and international economies delays or changes in aircraft and component orders could impact the future demand for our products and have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition while the market for commercial aircraft has improved since the downturn triggered by the events of september 11th and the war in iraq another such event could increase the level of uncertainty regarding future orders for aircraft 

 

many of the oem customers of the businesses in our aerospace engines and components segment are privatelyheld and may not be wellcapitalized in 2007 one of the airplane manufacturer customers of teledyne continental motors filed a petition for bankruptcy resulting in a 17 million write down of our accounts receivable in february 2008 adam aircraft filed for bankruptcy protection we have no unpaid 

receivables from adam aircraft outstanding any future credit problems with our customers could result in similar or larger write downs 

 

several of our businesses are also suppliers to the semiconductor industry which is highly cyclical by nature the semiconductor industry has experienced significant and sometimes prolonged downturns any downturn in the semiconductor industry or any other industry that uses a significant number of semiconductor devices such as consumer electronic products telecommunication devices or computing devices could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results 

 

in addition we sell products and services to customers in industries that are sensitive to the level of general economic activity and in mature industries that are sensitive to capacity adverse economic conditions affecting these industries may reduce demand for our products and services which may reduce our profits or our production levels or both 

 

we sell products to customers in industries that may undergo rapid and unpredictable changes 

 

we develop and manufacture products for customers in industries that have undergone rapid changes in the past for example we manufacture products and provide manufacturing services to companies that serve telecommunications markets during 2001 many segments of the telecommunications market experienced a dramatic and rapid downturn that resulted in cancellations or deferrals of orders for our products and services this market or others that we serve may exhibit rapid changes in the future and may adversely affect our operating results or our production levels or both we also manufacture products using fuel cell technology which is a market that is not well established and subject to significant change and evolution 

 

we are subject to the risks associated with international sales 

 

during 2007 sales to international customers accounted for approximately 22 of our total revenues as compared to 21 in 2006 and 18 in 2005 we anticipate that future sales to international customers will continue to account for a significant percentage of our revenues risks associated with these sales include 

 

  

any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition exchange rate fluctuations may negatively affect the cost of our products to international customers and therefore reduce our competitive position if the us dollar strengthens against the british pound sterling or euro our european customers may no longer find our product prices more attractive than european competitors 

 

sales of our products and services internationally are subject to us and local government regulations and procurement policies and practices including regulations relating to importexport control violations of export control rules could result in suspension of our ability to export items from one or more business units or the entire corporation depending on the scope of the suspension this could have a material effect on our ability to perform certain international contracts concerns over theft of technology for military uses nuclear proliferation concerns terrorism and other factors have resulted in increased export scrutiny of international sales including some of our products to international customers there has also been increasing export oversight and regulation of sales to china travel restrictions to middle eastern and other countries may 

negatively affect continuing international sales or service revenues from such regions there are also us and international regulations relating to investments exchange controls and repatriation of earnings as well as varying currency political and economic risks 

 

among other things we are subject to the foreign corrupt practices act or fcpa which generally prohibits us companies and their intermediaries from bribing foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or keeping business or otherwise obtaining favorable treatment in particular we may be held liable for actions taken by our strategic or local partners even though our partners are not subject to the fcpa any determination that we have violated the fcpa could result in sanctions that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

compliance with increasing environmental regulations and the effects of potential environmental liabilities could have a material adverse financial effect on us 

 

we like other industry participants are subject to various federal state local and international environmental laws and regulations we may be subject to increasingly stringent environmental standards in the future future developments administrative actions or liabilities relating to environmental matters could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

 

while we have as part of our overall risk management program an environmental management and compliance program applicable to our operating facilities including a “review and audit” program to monitor compliance where each facility is reviewed and audited by an internal environmental team every three years such program does not eliminate potential environmental liabilities in addition while we conduct environmentalrelated due diligence in acquisitions and generally seek some form of protection including indemnification from a seller companies we acquire may have environmental liabilities that are not accurately assessed or brought to our attention at the time of the acquisition 

 

for additional discussion of environmental matters see the discussion under the caption “other matters — environmental” of “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition” and note 15 to notes to consolidated financial statements 

 

increased environmental regulatory monitoring requirements of the air we breathe and the water we drink could have a favorable effect on the results of operations or financial condition of our instrumentation businesses including the sulfur dioxide carbon monoxide and ozone gas monitoring business of teledyne advanced pollution instrumentation inc and the water quality monitoring business of teledyne isco inc 

 

our inability to attract and retain key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our future success 

 

our future success depends to a significant extent upon the continued service of our executive officers and other key management and technical personnel and on our ability to continue to attract retain and motivate qualified personnel recruiting and retaining skilled technical and engineering personnel has become even more competitive as the domestic economy has improved in recent years also our engineered systems segment has already begun to face increasing competition for qualified engineering personnel as a result of the department of defense 2005 base realignment and closure also known as brac decisions particularly as positions continue to move to huntsville alabama over the next several years while we have engaged in succession planning the loss of the services of one or more of our key employees or our failure to attract retain and motivate qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

we may not be able to sell or exit on acceptable terms product lines that we determine no longer meet with our growth strategy 

 

consistent with our growth strategy to focus on markets to expand our profitable niche businesses we continually evaluate our product lines to ensure that they are aligned with our strategy for example after the june 2004 acquisition of isco inc we determined that the online process control instrumentation business of 

its german subsidiary was not aligned with our strategy and in march 2005 we sold this nonstrategic business in 2007 principally because of the decision of a customer to manufacture certain medical products at its facilities in india we closed our contract manufacturing operations in el rubi mexico and transferred the remaining operations to our la mesa mexico facility and our lewisburg tennessee facility 

 

our ability to dispose of or exit product lines that may no longer be aligned with our growth strategy will depend on many factors including the terms and conditions of any asset purchase and sale agreement as well as industry business and economic conditions we cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to sell nonstrategic product lines on terms that are acceptable to us or at all also if the sale of any nonstrategic product line cannot be consummated or is not practical alternative courses of action including closure may not be available to us or may be more costly than anticipated 

 

provisions of our governing documents applicable law and our change in control severance agreements could make an acquisition of teledyne technologies more difficult 

 

our restated certificate of incorporation amended and restated bylaws and rights agreement and the general corporation law of the state of delaware contain several provisions that could make the acquisition of control of teledyne technologies in a transaction not approved by our board of directors more difficult we have also entered into change in control severance agreements with 14 members of our management which could have an antitakeover effect 

 

the market price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly since our spinoff from ati and could continue to do so 

 

since the spinoff from ati on november 29 1999 the market price of our common stock has ranged from a low of 76875 to a high of 5721 per share at february 26 2008 our closing stock price was 4684 fluctuations in our stock price could continue among the factors that could affect our stock price are 

 

  

the stock markets in general and the markets for high technology companies in particular have experienced a high degree of volatility not necessarily related to the operating performance of these companies we cannot provide assurances as to our stock price 

 

our financial statements are based on estimates required by gaap and actual results may differ materially from those estimated under different assumptions or conditions 

 

our financial statements are prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states these principles require our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of 

revenue and expenses during the reporting period for example estimates are used when accounting for items such as asset valuations allowances for doubtful accounts depreciation and amortization impairment assessments employee benefits taxes aircraft product and general liability and contingencies while we base our estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances at the time made actual results may differ materially from those estimated 

 

while we believe our control systems are effective there are inherent limitations in all control systems and misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected 

 

we continue to take action to assure compliance with the internal controls disclosure controls and other requirements of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer cannot guarantee that our internal controls and disclosure controls will prevent all possible errors or all fraud a control system no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met in addition the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefit of controls must be relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no system of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within the company have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake further controls can be circumvented by individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more persons or by management override of the controls the design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions over time a control may be inadequate because of changes in conditions or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate because of inherent limitations in a costeffective control system misstatements resulting from error or fraud may occur and may not be detected 

 

natural disasters such as a serious earthquake or wildfire in california or a major hurricane in alabama or florida could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

 

several of our facilities as a result of their locations could be subject to a catastrophic loss caused by an earthquake a hurricane or a tornado many of our production facilities and our headquarters are located in california and thus are in areas with above average seismic activity and may also be at risk of damage in wildfires in addition we have manufacturing facilities in the southeastern united states and texas that have been threatened and struck by major hurricanes our facilities in alabama florida kansas nebraska and tennessee have also been threatened by tornados in 2007 prior to our acquisition of storm products co a tornado caused minor damage to one of its dallas texas facilities while teledyne continental motors’ pistonengines manufacturing facility located in mobile alabama teledyne geophysical instruments’ facility in houston texas and odi’s facility in daytona beach florida were relatively fortunate with respect to the building damage and business interruption they suffered during the severe 2005 hurricane season there can be no assurance that any one of them will be as fortunate in the future if any of our california facilities including our california headquarters were to experience a catastrophic earthquake or wildfire loss or if any of our alabama florida nebraska kansas tennessee or texas facilities were to experience a catastrophic hurricane storm or tornado such event could disrupt our operations delay production shipments and revenue and result in large expenses to repair or replace the facility or facilities while teledyne has property insurance to partially reimburse it for losses caused by windstorm and earth movement such insurance would not cover all possible losses in addition our existing disaster recovery plans including those relating to our information technology systems may not be fully responsive to or minimize losses associated with catastrophic events

the increase in segment operating profit and other segment income for 2007 compared with 2006 reflected the impact of higher sales operating profit and other segment income was higher in each operating segment fiscal year 2006 also included the receipt of 25 million pursuant to an agreement with honda motor co ltd the 339 million increase in operating profit in the electronics and communications segment included incremental operating profit from acquisitions and related synergies of 155 million 

 

effective january 2 2006 we adopted the provisions of financial accounting standards board “fasb” sfas no 123r “share based payment” “sfas no 123r” using the modified prospective method and began recording stock option compensation expense in the consolidated statements of income but did not restate prior year financial statements stock option compensation expense is recorded on a straight line basis over the appropriate vesting period generally three years for fiscal year 2007 we recorded a total of 68 million in stock option expense related to stock options awarded after the adoption of sfas no 123r and for stock options which were not vested by the date of adoption of sfas no 123r of this amount 23 million was recorded as corporate expense and 45 million was recorded in the operating segment results for fiscal year 2006 we recorded a total of 59 million in stock option expense of which 22 million was recorded as corporate expense and 37 million was recorded in the operating segment results 

 

cost of sales in total dollars was higher in 2007 compared with 2006 primarily due to higher sales which resulted from organic growth and acquisitions fiscal year 2007 included 13 million in lifo expense compared with 07 million in lifo expense in 2006 cost of sales as a percentage of sales for 2007 was 700 compared with 712 for 2006 the lower cost of sales percentage in 2007 primarily reflected sales mix differences and a continued emphasis on margin improvement and cost control 

 

selling general and administrative expenses including research and development and bid and proposal expense in total dollars were higher in 2007 compared with 2006 this 357 million increase was primarily due to higher sales which resulted from organic growth and acquisitions and also included 68 million in stock option compensation expense in 2007 compared with 59 million in stock option compensation expense in 2006 the increase also reflected higher corporate expense of 49 million compared with 2006 due to higher employee compensation and relocation expense and professional fee expenses selling general and administrative expenses for 2007 as a percentage of sales were 199 compared with 201 for 2006 and reflected sales mix differences 

 

included in operating profit in 2007 was pension expense of 119 million in accordance with the pension accounting requirements of sfas no 87 “employers’ accounting for pensions” of which 102 million was recoverable in accordance with us government cost accounting standards “cas” from certain government contracts included in operating profit in 2006 was pension expense of 154 million of which 105 million was recoverable in accordance with us government cas the decrease in pension expense in 2007 compared with 2006 reflects in part pension contributions made in 2006 the impact of favorable market returns on plan assets in 2006 and changes to the company’s pension assets and liabilities resulting from the merger of the teledyne scientific  imaging pension plan with teledyne technologies pension plan pension expense determined under cas can generally be recovered through the pricing of products and services sold to the us government 

the company’s effective tax rate for 2007 was 341 compared with 340 for 2006 the company completed an analysis of research and development spending for 2000 through 2006 as well as the base period years and anticipates the receipt of income tax refunds for those years the effective tax rate for 2007 reflects the impact of expected research and development income tax refunds of 44 million and also reflects the reversal of 11 million in income tax contingency reserves which were determined to be no longer needed due to the completion of state tax audits and the expiration of applicable statutes of limitations excluding these items the effective tax rate for 2007 would have been 377 the effective tax rate for the 2006 reflects the impact of the reversal of income tax contingency reserves of 33 million which were determined to be no longer needed due to the expiration of applicable statutes of limitations excluding the impact of the reversal the effective tax rate for 2006 would have been 367

selling general and administrative expenses including research and development and bid and proposal expense in total dollars were higher in 2006 compared with 2005 this 517 million increase was primarily due to higher sales which resulted from organic growth and acquisitions and also included 59 million in stock option compensation expense in 2006 compared with no stock option compensation expense in 2005 the increase in 2006 also reflected higher corporate expense of 68 million compared with 2005 due to the impact of stock option compensation expense and higher professional fees expense selling general and administrative expenses for 2006 as a percentage of sales were 201 compared with 196 for 2005 and reflected a higher general and administrative expense percentage due to the impact of stock option 

compensation expense and a higher selling expense percentage partially offset by a slightly lower research and development and bid and proposal expense percentage the higher selling expense percentage was due to recent acquisitions which due to the nature of their business carry a higher selling expense percentage than most of teledyne’s existing businesses 

 

included in operating profit in 2006 was pension expense of 154 million of which 105 million was recoverable in accordance with us government cost accounting standards “cas” from certain government contracts included in operating profit in 2005 was pension expense of 127 million of which 93 million was recoverable in accordance with us government cas the increase in pension expense in 2006 compared with 2005 reflects in part a reduction in the discount rate assumption for the company’s defined benefit plan to 600 in 2006 from 625 in 2005 pension expense determined under cas can generally be recovered through the pricing of products and services sold to the us government 

 

the company’s effective tax rate for 2006 was 340 compared with 376 for 2005 the lower effective tax rate for 2006 compared with 2005 reflects the impact of the reversal of income tax contingency reserves of 33 million during the third quarter these reserves were determined to be no longer needed due to the expiration of applicable statutes of limitations excluding the impact of the reversal the effective tax rate for 2006 would have been 367 

 

sales under contracts with the us government were approximately 40 of sales in 2006 and 42 of sales in 2005 sales to international customers represented approximately 21 of sales in 2006 compared with 18 of sales in 2005 

 

total interest expense including credit facility fees and other bank charges was 77 million in 2006 and 38 million in 2005 interest income was 03 million in both 2006 and 2005 the higher interest expense in 2006 primarily reflected higher outstanding debt levels due to acquisitions and higher average interest rates in 2006 compared with 2005 

 

minority interest reflects the minority ownership interests in ocean design inc and teledyne energy systems inc 

 

other income for 2006 and 2005 included the receipt of 25 million and 50 million respectively pursuant to an agreement with honda motor co ltd which is included as part of the aerospace engines and components segment operating profit and other segment income for segment reporting purposes the 25 million received in january 2006 was the final receipt pursuant to the agreement fiscal years 2006 and 2005 also include sublease rental income and royalty income in other income

financial condition liquidity and capital resources 

 

principal capital requirements 

 

our principal capital requirements are to fund working capital needs capital expenditures and debt service requirements as well as to fund acquisitions it is anticipated that operating cash flow together with available borrowings under the credit facility described below will be sufficient to meet these requirements and could be used to fund some acquisitions in the year 2008 to support acquisitions we may need to raise additional capital our liquidity is not dependent upon the use of offbalance sheet financial arrangements we have no offbalance sheet financing arrangements that incorporate the use of special purpose entities or unconsolidated entities 

 

revolving credit agreement 

 

on february 8 2008 teledyne technologies entered into a first amendment to its now amended and restated credit agreement dated as of july 14 2006 the amended and restated credit facility has lender commitments totaling 5900 million and expires on july 14 2011 excluding interest and fees no payments are due under the amended and restated credit facility until it matures the credit agreement requires the company to comply with various financial and operating covenants including maintaining certain consolidated leverage and interest coverage ratios as well as minimum net worth levels and limits on acquired debt at december 30 2007 the company was in compliance with these covenants available borrowing capacity under the prior 4000 million credit facility which is reduced by borrowings outstanding letters of credit and certain guarantees was 2531 million at december 30 2007 for a description of some terms of our credit facility see “financing activities” on page 50 

 

contractual obligations 

 

the following table summarizes our expected cash outflows resulting from financial contracts and commitments at december 30 2007 we have not included information on our normal recurring purchases of 

materials for use in our operations these amounts are generally consistent from year to year closely reflect our levels of production and are not longterm in nature in millions 

 

 

 

 

  

the amounts above exclude our minimum pension plan funding requirements including those set forth by erisa which are 79 million in 2008 and 75 million in 2009 our minimum funding requirements after 2007 are dependent on several factors as discussed under “accounting for pension plans” in the critical accounting policies section of this management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation estimates beyond 2009 have not been provided due to the significant uncertainty of these amounts which are subject to change until the company’s sfas no 87 assumptions can be updated at the appropriate times in addition certain pension contributions are eligible for future recovery through the pricing of products and services to the us government under certain government contracts therefore the amounts noted are not necessarily indicative of the impact these contributions may have on the company’s liquidity we also have payments due under our other postretirement benefits plans these plans are not required to be funded in advance but are pay as you go see further discussion in note 12 of the notes to consolidated financial statements

operating activities 

 

in 2007 net cash provided from operations was 1667 million compared with 784 million in 2006 and 923 million in 2005 

 

the higher net cash provided for 2007 compared with 2006 was primarily due to incremental cash flow from companies acquired since 2005 higher net income higher customer advance payments and deposits improved accounts receivable collections due to timing and 124 million in lower pension contributions 

the lower net cash provided for 2006 compared with 2005 reflected 146 million in higher income tax payments and 39 million in higher pension contributions partially offset by higher net income cash flow from companies acquired since 2005 and 31 million in insurance receipts additionally in accordance with sfas no 123r 86 million of excess tax benefits in 2006 for stock option compensation have been classified as a financing cash flow instead of an operating cash flow as in prior years in 2005 cash flow from operations included 52 million in excess tax benefits related to stockbased compensation

the dgo and tindall acquisitions the decrease in longterm debt and capital lease obligations reflected the use of cash flow to repay outstanding debt the accrued pension obligation increased primarily as a result of an increase in the unfunded pension liability in 2007 due in part to lower returns on pension assets partially offset by pension contributions the increase in other longterm liabilities reflected an increase in the aircraft product liability reserve and higher compensation reserves including deferred compensation the change in the accumulated other comprehensive loss reflected the 193 million noncash adjustment related to the increase in the unfunded pension liability in 2007

other matters 

 

income taxes 

 

the company’s effective tax rate for 2007 was 341 compared with 340 for 2006 and 376 for 2005 the company completed an analysis of research and development spending for 2000 through 2006 as well as the base period years and anticipates the receipt of income tax refunds for those years the effective tax rate for 2007 reflects the impact of expected research and development income tax refunds of 44 million and also reflects the reversal of 11 million in income tax contingency reserves which were determined to be 

no longer needed due to the completion of state tax audits and the expiration of applicable statutes of limitations excluding these items the effective tax rate for 2007 would have been 377 the effective tax rate for the 2006 reflects the impact of the reversal of income tax contingency reserves of 33 million which were determined to be no longer needed due to the expiration of applicable statutes of limitations excluding the impact of the reversal the effective tax rate for 2006 would have been 367 based on the company’s history of operating earnings expectations of future operating earnings and potential tax planning strategies it is more likely than not that the deferred income tax assets at december 30 2007 will be realized 

 

costs and pricing 

 

inflationary trends in recent years have been moderate current inventory costs the increasing costs of equipment and other costs are considered in establishing sales pricing polices the company emphasizes cost containment in all aspects of its business 

 

hedging activities market risk disclosures 

 

we have not utilized derivative financial instruments such as futures contracts options and swaps forward foreign exchange contracts or interest rate swaps and futures during 2007 or 2006 we believe that adequate controls are in place to monitor any hedging activities our primary exposure to market risk relates to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates we periodically evaluate these risks and have taken measures to mitigate these risks we own assets and operate facilities in countries that have been politically stable also our foreign risk management objectives are geared towards stabilizing cash flow from the effects of foreign currency fluctuations most of the company’s sales are denominated in us dollars which mitigates the effect of exchange rate changes borrowings under our credit facility are at fixed rates that vary with the term and timing of each loan under the facility loans under the facility typically have terms of one two three or six months and the interest rate for each such loan is subject to change if the loan is continued or converted following the applicable maturity date interest rates are also subject to change based on our debt to earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization ratio as of december 30 2007 we had 1380 million in outstanding indebtedness under our amended and restated credit facility a 100 basis point change in interest rates would result in an increase in annual interest expense of approximately 14 million assuming the 1380 million in debt was outstanding for the full year any borrowings under the company’s revolving credit line are based on a fluctuating market interest rate and consequently the fair value of any outstanding debt should not be affected materially by changes in market interest rates overall we believe that our exposure to interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange rate changes is not material to our financial condition or results of operations 

 

related party transactions 

 

in connection with the spinoff teledyne and ati entered into several agreements governing the separation of our businesses and various employee benefits compensation tax indemnification and transition arrangements the company’s principal spinoff requirements including the requirement to ensure a favorable tax treatment have been satisfied one of our directors continues to serve on ati’s board

environmental 

 

we are subject to various federal state local and international environmental laws and regulations which require that we investigate and remediate the effects of the release or disposal of materials at sites associated with past and present operations these include sites at which teledyne has been identified as a potentially responsible party under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act commonly known as superfund and comparable state laws we are currently involved in the investigation and remediation of a number of sites reserves for environmental investigation and remediation totaled approximately 44 million at december 30 2007 and 51 million at december 31 2006 as investigation and remediation of these sites proceed and new information is received the company expects that accruals will be adjusted to reflect new information based on current information we do not believe that future environmental costs in excess of those already accrued will materially and adversely affect our financial condition or liquidity however resolution of one or more of these environmental matters or future accrual adjustments in any one reporting period could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations for that period 

 

for additional discussion of environmental matters see notes 2 and 15 to the notes to consolidated financial statements 

 

government contracts 

 

we perform work on a number of contracts with the department of defense and other agencies and departments of the us government including subcontracts with government prime contractors sales under these contracts with the us government which included contracts with the department of defense were approximately 41 of total sales in 2007 40 of total sales in 2006 and 42 of total sales in 2005 for a summary of sales to the us government by segment see note 13 to the notes to consolidated financial statements sales to the department of defense represented approximately 30 30 and 32 of total sales for 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively 

 

performance under government contracts has certain inherent risks that could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business results of operations and financial condition government contracts are conditioned upon the continuing availability of congressional appropriations which usually occurs on a fiscal year basis even though contract performance may take more than one year while us defense spending increased as a result of the september 11th terrorist attacks and the war in iraq it is currently expected to moderate over the next few years notwithstanding the recent increase in u s defense spending delays or declines in us military expenditures in the programs in which we participate could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

 

for information on accounts receivable from the us government see note 5 to the notes to consolidated financial statements 

 

estimates and reserves 

 

our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent liabilities on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including those related to product returns allowance for doubtful accounts inventories intangible assets income taxes warranty obligations pension and other postretirement benefits longterm contracts environmental workers’ compensation and general liability aircraft product liability employee dental and medical benefits and other contingencies and litigation we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances at the time the results of which form the basis for making our judgments actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions 

or conditions in some cases such differences may be material see “other matters — critical accounting policies” 

 

the following table reflects significant reserves and valuation accounts which are estimates and based on judgments as described above at december 30 2007 and december 31 2006 

 

reserves and valuation accountsa 

 

 

 

  

some of the company’s products are subject to specified warranties and the company provides for the estimated cost of product warranties we regularly assess the adequacy of our preexisting warranty liabilities and adjust amounts as necessary based on a review of historic warranty experience with respect to the applicable business or products as well as the length and actual terms of the warranties which are typically one year the product warranty reserve is included in current accrued liabilities on the balance sheet changes in the company’s product warranty reserve are as follows in millions 

 

 

 

critical accounting policies 

 

the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with united states generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the notes to the financial statements some of those judgments can be subjective and complex and therefore actual results could differ materially from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions our critical accounting policies are those that are reflective of significant judgment complexity and uncertainty and may potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions we have identified the following as critical accounting policies revenue recognition aircraft product liability reserve accounting for pension plans accounting for business combinations goodwill and other longlived assets and accounting for income taxes for additional discussion of the application of these and other accounting policies see note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

 

revenue recognition 

 

commercial sales and sales from us government fixedprice type contracts are generally recorded as shipments are made or as services are rendered we account for these contracts in accordance with the 

securities and exchange commissions’ staff accounting bulletin “sab” no 104 “revenue recognition” or other relevant revenue recognition accounting literature occasionally for certain fixedprice type contracts that require substantial performance over a long time period generally one or more years in accordance with the requirements of american institute of certified public accountants statement of position 811 “accounting for performance of constructiontype and certain productiontype contracts” “sop 811” revenues are recorded under the percentageofcompletion method we measure the extent of progress toward completion using the unitsofdelivery method costtocost method or upon attainment of scheduled performance milestones which could be time event or expense driven occasionally invoices are submitted to and paid by the customer under a contractual agreement which has a different time schedule than the related revenue recognition sales under costreimbursement contracts usually from the us government are recorded as allowable costs are incurred and fees are earned 

 

the development of cost of sales percentages used to record costs under certain fixedprice type contracts and fees under certain costreimbursement type contracts requires management’s judgment to make reasonably dependable cost estimates for the design manufacture and delivery of products and services generally over a long time period since certain fixedprice and costreimbursement type contracts extend over a long period of time the impact of revisions in cost and revenue estimates during the progress of work may adjust the current period earnings on a cumulative catchup basis this method recognizes in the current period the cumulative effect of the changes on current and prior quarters for fixedprice contracts if the current contract estimate indicates a loss a provision is made for the total anticipated loss in the period that it becomes evident contract cost and revenue estimates for significant contracts are generally reviewed and reassessed quarterly these types of contracts and estimates are most frequently related to our sales to the us government or sales to other defense contractors for ultimate sale to the us government for our sales to the us government in 2007 2006 and 2005 operating income as a percent of sales did not vary by more than 05 if operating income as a percent of sales to the us government had been higher or lower by 05 in 2007 the company’s operating income would have changed by approximately 41 million

we are currently involved in certain legal proceedings related to aircraft product liability claims we have accrued an estimate for the probable costs for the resolution of these claims this estimate has been developed in consultation with our insurers outside counsel handling our defense in these matters and historical experience and is based upon an analysis of potential results assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies we do not believe these proceedings will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position it is possible however that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by specific events occurring in the period changes in our assumptions or the effectiveness of our strategies related to these proceedings the company has aircraft and product liability insurance the current annual selfinsurance retention is 210 million compared with 229 million in 2006 if a significant liability claim or combination of claims were identified even taking into account insurance coverage operating profit in a given period could be reduced significantly accruals could be made in a given period for amounts up to our annual selfinsurance retention based on the facts and circumstances of the claims we have not always accrued amounts up to our annual selfinsurance retention also we cannot assure that for 2008 and in future years our ability to obtain insurance or the premiums for such insurance or the amount of our selfinsured retention or reserves will not be negatively impacted by our experience in prior years or other factors our current aircraft product liability insurance policy expires in may 2008 

 

accounting for pension plans 

 

teledyne has a defined benefit pension plan covering most of its employees the company accounts for its defined benefit pension plan in accordance with sfas no 87 “employers’ accounting for pensions” and sfas no 158 “employers’ accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans — an amendment of fasb statements no 87 88 106 and 132r” which requires that amounts recognized in financial statements be determined on an actuarial basis rather than as contributions are made to the plan a 

significant element in determining the company’s pension income or expense is the expected return on plan assets the company has assumed based upon the types of securities the plan assets are invested in and the longterm historical returns of these investments that the longterm expected return on pension assets will be 85 in 2008 and its assumed discount rate will be 60 in 2008 the same rates were used in 2007 the actual rate of return on pension assets was 25 in 2007 and 151 in 2006 if the actual rate of return on pension assets is above the projection the company may be able to reduce its contributions to the pension trust if the actual rate of return on pension assets is below the projection the company may be required to make additional contributions to the pension trust the company made an aftertax contribution of 45 million to its pension benefit plans in 2007 and currently anticipates making an aftertax cash contribution of approximately 56 million to its pension benefit plans in 2008 before recovery from the us government the assumed longterm rate of return on assets is applied to the marketrelated value of plan assets at the end of the previous year this produces the expected return on plan assets that is included in annual pension income or expense calculation for the current year the cumulative difference between this expected return and the actual return on plan assets is deferred and amortized into pension income or expense over future periods in accordance with the requirements of sfas no 158 at yearend 2007 the company has a 627 million noncash reduction to stockholders’ equity and a longterm additional liability of 1030 million at yearend 2006 the company had a 434 million noncash reduction to stockholders’ equity and a longterm additional liability of 713 million see note 12 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional pension disclosures 

 

differences in the discount rate and expected longterm rate of return on assets within the indicated range would have had the following impact on 2007 results 

 

 

 

see note 12 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional pension disclosures 

 

accounting for business combinations goodwill and other longlived assets 

 

the company accounts for goodwill and purchased intangible assets under sfas no 141 “business combinations” and sfas no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” in all acquisitions the results are generally included in the company’s consolidated financial statements from the date of each respective acquisition business acquisitions are accounted for under the purchase method by assigning the purchase price to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at their fair values and the excess of the purchase price over the amounts assigned is recorded as goodwill purchased intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives adjustments to fair value assessments are recorded to goodwill over the purchase price allocation period generally not longer than twelve months with the exception of certain adjustments related to income tax uncertainties the resolution of which may extend beyond the purchase price allocation period 

 

goodwill and acquired intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized we review goodwill and acquired indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable the company also performs an annual impairment test in the fourth quarter of each year based on the annual impairment test completed in the fourth quarter of 2007 no impairment of goodwill or intangible assets with indefinite lives was indicated the company estimates the fair value of the reporting units which are our four business segments using a discounted cash flow model based on our best estimate of amounts and timing of future revenues and cash flows and our most recent business and strategic plans and compares the estimated fair value to the net book value of the reporting unit including goodwill the development of future revenues and cash flows projections for our business and strategic plan and the annual impairment test involve significant judgments changes in these projections could affect the estimated fair value of certain of the company’s reporting units and could 

result in a goodwill impairment charge in a future period however a 10 percent decrease in the current fair value estimate of each of the company’s reporting units would not result in a goodwill impairment charge 

 

we monitor the recoverability of the carrying value of our longlived assets an impairment charge is recognized when events and circumstances indicate that the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by an asset including any proceeds from dispositions are less than the carrying value of the asset and the asset’s carrying value is less than its fair value our cash flow estimates are based on historical results adjusted to reflect our best estimate of future market and operating conditions the net carrying value of assets not recoverable is reduced to fair value our estimates of fair value represent our best estimate based on industry trends and reference to market rates and transactions our determination of what constitutes an indication of possible impairment the estimation of future cash flows and the determination of estimated fair value are all significant judgments 

 

accounting for income taxes 

 

income tax expense and deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect management’s assessment of actual future taxes to be paid on items reflected in the financial statements significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes uncertainty exists regarding tax positions taken in previously filed tax returns still under examination and positions expected to be taken in future returns deferred tax assets and liabilities arise due to differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and tax carryforwards although we believe our income tax expense and deferred tax assets and liabilities are reasonable no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome will not be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals to the extent that the final tax outcome is different than the amounts recorded such differences will impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made the provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate as well as the related net interest 

 

significant judgment is required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets in assessing the need for a valuation allowance we consider all available evidence including past operating results estimates of future taxable income and the feasibility of tax planning strategies in the event that we change our determination as to the amount of deferred tax assets that can be realized we will adjust our valuation allowance with a corresponding impact to the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made 

 

our effective tax rates differ from the statutory rate primarily due to the tax impact of the research and development tax credits state taxes and tax audit settlements the effective tax rate was 341 340 and 376 in fiscal 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively see recent accounting pronouncements and note 11 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for disclosures regarding the adoption of fin no 48 

 

recent accounting pronouncements 

 

sfas no 141r 

 

in december 2007 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 141r “business combinations” “sfas no 141r” this statement replaces fasb statement no 141 “business combinations” sfas no 141r establishes principles and requirements for how the acquirer of a business recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree the statement also provides guidance for recognizing and measuring the goodwill acquired in the business combination and determines what information to disclose to enable users of the financial statement to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination sfas no 141r applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december 15 2008 and accordingly will not impact the accounting for acquisitions made prior to its adoption for any acquisitions completed after our 2008 fiscal year we expect sfas no 141r 

will have an impact on our consolidated financial statements however the nature and magnitude of the specific effects will depend upon the nature terms and size of the acquisitions we consummate 

 

sfas no 160 

 

in december 2007 the fasb issued sfas no 160 “noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements — an amendment of arb no 51” “sfas no 160” sfas no 160 changes the way the consolidated income statement is presented and establishes a single method of accounting for changes in a parent’s ownership interest in a subsidiary that does not result in deconsolidation it also requires that a parent recognize a gain or loss in net income when a subsidiary is deconsolidated this statement will be effective for teledyne’s 2009 fiscal year and interim periods within that fiscal year sfas no 160 will be applied prospectively as of the beginning of the fiscal year 2009 except for the presentation and disclosure requirements the presentation and disclosure requirements must be applied retrospectively for all periods presented the company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this statement 

 

sfas no 159 

 

in february 2007 the fasb issued sfas no 159 “the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities — including an amendment of fasb statement no 115” sfas no 159 permits entities to choose to measure eligible items at fair value at specified election dates and report unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected in earnings at each subsequent reporting date sfas no 159 is effective for fiscal years beginning after november 15 2007 the company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this statement however the adoption is not expected to have an effect on the company’s consolidated results of operations or financial position 

 

eitf no 073 

 

in june 2007 the fasb ratified eitf no 073 “eitf 073” “accounting for nonrefundable advance payments for goods or services to be used in future research and development activities” eitf 073 requires nonrefundable advance payments for goods and services to be used in future research and development activities to be recorded as an asset and the payments to be expensed when the research and development activities are performed eitf 073 is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2007 the company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this statement however the adoption is not expected to have an effect on the company’s consolidated results of operations or financial position 

 

fin no 48 

 

on january 1 2007 teledyne technologies adopted fasb interpretation no 48 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes “fin no 48” fin no 48 prescribes a minimum recognition threshold and measurement methodology that a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements it also provides guidance for derecognition classification interest and penalties accounting in interim periods disclosure and transition as a result of the implementation the company recognized a 02 million increase in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits which were accounted for as a cumulativeeffect adjustment decrease to the beginning balance of retained earnings as of the date of adoption and after the impact of recognizing the increase in the liability noted above the company’s total gross unrecognized tax benefits and related interest totaled 55 million 

the following presents a rollforward of our unrecognized tax benefits in millions 

 

 

 

we recognized interest related to unrecognized tax benefits of 03 million within the provision for income taxes on continuing operations in our statements of operations interest in the amount of 05 million is recognized in the 2007 statement of financial position as of december 30 2007 we estimated that the entire balance of unrecognized tax benefits if resolved in our favor would positively impact the effective tax rate and therefore be recognized as additional tax benefits in our income statement 

 

we file income tax returns in the united states federal jurisdiction and in various states and foreign jurisdictions except for refund claims related to credits for research activities the company has substantially concluded on all us federal income tax matters for years through 2003 substantially all other material state and local and foreign income tax matters have been concluded for years through 2002 

 

the company anticipates the total unrecognized tax benefit may be reduced by 10 million due to the expiration of statutes of limitation for various federal and state tax issues in the next 12 months 

 

sfas no 157 

 

in september 2006 the fasb issued sfas no 157 “fair value measurements” which defines fair value establishes a framework in generally accepted accounting principles for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements this standard only applies when other standards require or permit the fair value measurement of assets and liabilities it does not increase the use of fair value measurement sfas no 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after nov 15 2007 the company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this statement however the adoption is not expected to have a material effect on the company’s consolidated results of operations or financial position 

 

sfas no 123r 

 

in december 2004 the fasb issued sfas no 123r that requires compensation costs related to sharebased payment transactions to be recognized in the financial statements with limited exceptions the amount of compensation costs will be measured based on the grant date fair value of the equity or liability instrument issued compensation cost will be recognized over the period that an employee provides service in exchange for the award sfas no 123r replaces sfas no 123 “accounting for stockbased compensation” and supersedes apb opinion no 25 “accounting for stock issued to employees” the company adopted sfas no 123r effective january 2 2006 using the modified prospective method and accordingly did not restate prior year financial statements no modifications to outstanding stock options were made prior to the adoption of sfas no 123r the valuation methodologies and assumptions in estimating the fair value of stock options granted in 2007 were similar to those used in estimating the fair value of stock options granted in 2006 stock option compensation expense is recorded on a straight line basis over the appropriate vesting period generally three years for fiscal year 2007 and 2006 the company recorded a total of 68 million and 59 million respectively for stock option expense related to stock options awarded after the adoption of sfas no 123r and for stock options which were not vested by the date of adoption of sfas no 123r no compensation expense related to stock options was recorded in the consolidated statements of income for 2005 or in prior years since it was not required 

outlook 

 

based on its current outlook the company’s management believes that first quarter 2008 earnings per diluted share will be in the range of approximately 063 to 066 the full year 2008 earnings per diluted share outlook is expected to be in the range of approximately 286 to 294 our 2008 outlook reflects anticipated sales growth in our defense electronics and instrumentation businesses due primarily to the recent acquisitions in addition the company’s first quarter and full year 2008 earnings per diluted share outlook reflects an anticipated increase in expenses including intangible asset amortization and higher interest expense as a result of these acquisitions our estimated effective tax rate for 2008 is expected to be 390 excluding expected research and development income tax refund claims of 13 million in the first quarter of 2008 

 

the full year 2008 earnings outlook includes approximately 100 million in pension expense under sfas no 87 and no 158 or 06 million in net pension expense after recovery of allowable pension costs from our cas covered government contracts full year 2007 earnings included 119 million in pension expense under sfas no 87 and no 158 or 17 million in net pension expense after recovery of allowable pension costs from our cas covered government contracts the decrease in full year 2008 pension expense reflects pension contributions made in 2007 

 

our 2008 earnings outlook also reflects 78 million in stock option compensation expense the company’s 2007 earnings included 68 million in stock option compensation expense

customers 

 

we have hundreds of customers in the electronics communications aerospace and defense industries no commercial customer accounted for more than 10 of our total sales during 2006 2005 or 2004 

 

approximately 40 42 and 43 of our total sales for 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively were derived from contracts with agencies of and prime contractors to the us government our principal us government customer is the us department of defense these sales represented 30 32 and 33 of our total sales for 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively in 2006 and 2005 our largest program with the us government was the systems engineering and technical assistance contract with the space and missile defense command and it represented 49 and 55 of total sales respectively in 2004 our largest program with the us government was the boeing company — groundbased midcourse defense contract representing 54 of total sales set forth below are sales by our segments to agencies and prime contractors to the us government for the periods presented 

 

us government sales 

 

 

 

our total backlog of confirmed orders was approximately 5824 million at december 31 2006 5219 million at january 1 2006 and 4713 million at january 2 2005 we expect to fulfill 98 of such backlog of confirmed orders during 2007 

 

international sales accounted for approximately 21 of total sales in 2006 as compared to 18 in 2005 and 19 in 2004 in 2006 we sold products to customers in over 100 foreign countries ninety percent of our sales to foreign customers were made to customers in 25 foreign countries 

 

sales and marketing 

 

our sales and marketing approach varies by segment and by products within our segments a shared fundamental tenet is the commitment to work closely with our customers to understand their needs with an aim to secure preferred supplier and longerterm relationships 

 

our business segments use a combination of internal sales forces distributors and commissioned sales representatives to market and sell our products and services as part of ongoing acquisition integration efforts some of our teledyne instruments companies continue to consolidate internal sales and servicing efforts 

 

products are also advertised in appropriate trade journals and by means of various websites to promote our products and other capabilities our personnel regularly participate in relevant trade shows and professional associations 

 

many of our government contracts are awarded after a competitive bidding process in which we seek to emphasize our ability to provide superior products and technical solutions in addition to competitive pricing 

 

through teledyne technologies international corp and other subsidiaries the company has established offices in foreign countries to facilitate international sales for various businesses 

 

competition 

 

we believe that technological capabilities and innovation and the ability to invest in the development of new and enhanced products are critical to obtaining and maintaining leadership in our markets and the industries in which we compete although we have certain advantages that we believe help us compete effectively in our markets each of our markets is highly competitive our businesses vigorously compete on the basis of quality product performance and reliability technical expertise price and service many of our competitors have and potential competitors could have greater name recognition a larger installed base of products more extensive engineering manufacturing marketing and distribution capabilities and greater financial technological and personnel resources than we do 

 

research and development 

 

our research and development efforts primarily involve engineering and design related to improving product lines and developing new products and technologies in the same or similar fields we spent a total of 3070 million 2915 million and 2633 million on research and development and bid and proposal costs for 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively customerfunded research and development most of which was attributable to work under contracts with the us government represented approximately 83 85 and 88 of total research and development costs for 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively 

 

in 2006 approximately 802 of the 555 million in companyfunded research and development and bid and proposal costs were incurred in our electronics and communications businesses we expect the level of companyfunded research and development and bid and proposal costs to be approximately 607 million in 2007 

 

intellectual property 

 

while we own and control various intellectual property rights including patents trade secrets confidential information trademarks trade names and copyrights which in the aggregate are of material importance to our business our management believes that our business as a whole is not materially dependent upon any one intellectual property or related group of such properties we own several hundred active patents and are licensed to use certain patents technology and other intellectual property rights owned and controlled by others similarly other companies are licensed to use certain patents technology and other intellectual property rights owned and controlled by us as part of our acquisition of scientific company in september 2006 we licensed certain intellectual property of the acquired company to rockwell automation and rockwell collins 

 

patents patent applications and license agreements will expire or terminate over time by operation of law in accordance with their terms or otherwise we do not expect the expiration or termination of these patents patent applications and license agreements to have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

 

employees 

 

our total current workforce consists of approximately 7700 employees the international union of united automobile aerospace and agricultural implement workers of america represents approximately 290 active employees in mobile alabama under a collective bargaining agreement that expired by its terms on 

february 20 2007 this union also represents approximately 35 of our active employees in toledo ohio under a collective bargaining agreement that expires by its terms on november 10 2009 we consider our relations with our employees to be good 

 

executive management 

 

teledyne’s executive management includes 

 

 11 

 

 

 

  

dr mehrabian and teledyne have entered into a second amended and restated employment agreement dated as of january 24 2006 the agreement provides that we will employ him as the chairman president and chief executive officer the agreement terminates on december 31 2007 but will automatically be extended annually unless either party gives the other written notice prior to october 31 of the year of such term that it will not be extended under the agreement dr mehrabian’s annual base salary is 750000 the agreement provides that dr mehrabian is entitled to participate in teledyne’s annual incentive bonus plan and other executive compensation and benefit programs the agreement provides dr mehrabian with a nonqualified pension arrangement under which teledyne will pay him starting six months following his retirement as payments supplemental to any accrued pension under our qualified pension plan an amount equal to 50 of his base compensation as in effect at retirement the number of years for which such annual amount shall be paid will be equal to the number of years of his service to teledyne including service to ati but not more than 10 years on january 23 2007 without amending the second amended and restated employment agreement teledyne’s board of directors asked dr mehrabian to continue to serve as its chairman president and chief executive officer through at least december 31 2009 

 

fifteen current members of management have entered into change in control severance agreements with teledyne the agreements have a threeyear automatically renewing term under the agreements the executive is entitled to severance benefits if 1 there is a change in control of teledyne and 2 within three months 

before or 24 months after the change in control either we terminate the executive’s employment for reasons other than for cause or the executive terminates employment for good reason “severance benefits” consist of 

 

  




 item 1a risk factors 

 

risk factors cautionary statement as to forwardlooking statements 

 

the following text highlights various risks and uncertainties associated with teledyne these factors could materially affect “forwardlooking statements” within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 that we may from time to time make including forwardlooking statements contained in “item 1 business” and “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” of this form 10k and in teledyne’s 2006 annual report to stockholders it is not possible for management to predict all of such factors and new factors may emerge additionally management cannot assess the impact of each such factor on teledyne or the extent to which any factor or combination of factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forwardlooking statements 

 

our dependence on revenue from government contracts subjects us to many risks 

 

  

we perform work on a number of contracts with the department of defense and other agencies and departments of the us government including subcontracts with government prime contractors sales under contracts with the us government as a whole including sales under contracts with the department of 

defense as prime contractor or subcontractor represented approximately 40 of our total revenue for 2006 as compared to 42 and 43 of our total revenue for 2005 and 2004 respectively performance under government contracts has certain inherent risks that could have a material effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

 

government contracts are conditioned upon the continuing availability of congressional appropriations congress typically appropriates funds for a given program on a fiscalyear basis even though contract performance may take more than one year as a result at the beginning of a major program a contract is typically only partially funded and additional monies are normally committed to the contract by the procuring agency only as congress makes appropriations available for future fiscal years 

 

while us defense spending increased as a result of the september 11th terrorist attacks and the war in iraq it is currently expected to continue to moderate over the next few years the continued war on terrorism and the iraqi situation could result in a diversion of funds from programs in which teledyne participates also continued defense spending does not necessarily correlate to continued business for us because not all the programs in which we participate or have current capabilities may be provided with continued funding further the recent changes in the leadership of the us congress could result over time in reductions in defense spending and further changes in programs in which we participate 

 

our electronics and communications segment provides a variety of products for newer military platforms such as the fa22 and f35 aircraft development and production of these aircraft are very expensive and there is no guarantee that the department of defense as it balances budget priorities will continue to provide funding to manufacture and support these platforms reallocation of funding priorities within the department of defense could also affect repair and spares sales for older military platforms including by way of example sales of our traveling wave tubes for f15 f16 f18 ea6b b52 b1 c130 and u2 aircraft 

 

  

over time and for a variety of reasons programs can evolve and affect the extent of our participation for example teledyne brown engineering’s groundbased midcourse defense program was restructured in 2003 to change the emphasis from a focus on test and evaluation to a focus on deployment and sustainment this resulted in a nearly 16 decline in revenues from this contract in 2003 compared to 2002 from 58 million to 49 million then in 2004 and 2005 revenues related to this program totaled approximately 54 million and 51 million respectively with the increases over 2003 resulting from unanticipated ground tests in 2006 revenues related to this program declined to 48 million and are expected to decline further in 2007 

 

the relocation to huntsville alabama of the missile defense agency or mda has resulted in the transfer to the mda of certain missions and functions from the us army space and missile defense command or smdc we understand that work currently performed under one or more existing smdc contracts may be transferred to one or more existing or new mda contracts such transfers may require us to recompete for some work currently performed by us and there is no guarantee that we would maintain historic levels of revenue or profitability if we successfully recompeted such changes could affect our systems engineering solutions segment but it is too early to tell the impact of such changes 

 

we have been a significant participant in nasa programs traditionally through our systems engineering solutions segment and more recently through teledyne scientific company the centerpiece of our current nasa activities is the international space station while we anticipate participating in nasa’s lunar and interplanetary exploration activities funding for these activities has been reduced as nasa focuses on the completion of the international space station and on keeping the space shuttle fleet in continuous service each of which is also facing a tightened budget these changes could adversely impact us for example we have been advised that funding for teledyne scientific company’s anticipated participation in the microlensed planet finder has been cancelled 

 

  

we obtain many us government prime contracts and subcontracts through the process of competitive bidding we may not be successful in having our bids accepted in addition we may spend substantial amounts of time money and effort including design development and marketing activities required to prepare bids and proposals for contracts that may not be awarded to us 

 

  

most of our us government contracts are subject to termination by the us government either at its convenience or upon the default of the contractor terminationforconvenience provisions provide only for the recovery of costs incurred or committed settlement expenses and profit on work completed prior to termination terminationfordefault clauses impose liability on the contractor for excess costs incurred by the us government in reprocuring undelivered items from another source during 2006 teledyne microwave had two us government contracts terminated for convenience we did not have any of our us government contracts terminated for default during 2006 

 

  

there is no guarantee that us government contracts will be profitable a number of our us government prime contracts and subcontracts are fixedprice type contracts 47 in 2006 and 2005 as compared to 43 in 2004 under these types of contracts we bear the inherent risk that actual performance cost may exceed the fixed contract price this is particularly true where the contract was awarded and the price finalized in advance of final completion of design under such contracts we must absorb cost overruns notwithstanding the difficulty of estimating all of the costs we will incur in performing these contracts our failure to anticipate technical problems estimate costs accurately or control costs during performance of a fixedprice contract may reduce the profitability of a fixedprice contract or cause a loss we cannot assure that our contract loss provisions in our financial statements will be adequate to cover all actual future losses we may lose money if we fail to meet these targets 

 

  

certain fees under some of our us government contracts are linked to meeting specified technical cost andor schedule targets including development or testing deadlines fees may also be influenced or dependent on the collective efforts and success of other defense contractors over which we had no or limited control 

 

we like other government contractors are subject to various audits reviews and investigations including private party “whistleblower” lawsuits relating to our compliance with federal and state laws we have a compliance program designed to surface issues that may lead to voluntary disclosures of contracting irregularities to the us government generally claims arising out of these us government inquiries and voluntary disclosures can be resolved without resorting to litigation however should the business unit or division involved be charged with wrongdoing or should the us government determine that the unit or division is not a “presently responsible contractor” that unit or division and conceivably our company as a whole could be temporarily suspended or in the event of a conviction could be debarred for up to three years from receiving new government contracts or governmentapproved subcontracts in addition we could expend substantial amounts in defending against such charges and in damages fines and penalties if such charges are proven or result in negotiated settlements in october 2002 we were informed that the us government had declined to intervene in a lawsuit filed under seal pursuant to the false claims act more than five years before our electronic safety products unit’s involvement in this civil action is over as a result of favorable court decisions 

 

our pension expenses and the value of our pension assets are affected by factors outside of our control including the performance of plan assets the stock market interest rates and actuarial data 

 

we have a defined benefit pension plan covering most of our employees at yearend 2006 the value of the combined pension assets was less than our accumulated pension benefit obligation notwithstanding favorable market conditions and the merger into our pension plan of the overfunded scientific company pension plan which was part of our september 2006 acquisition of scientific company given our pension plan’s underfunded status in 2004 we began making required cash contributions to our pension plan for 2006 and 2005 cash contributions totaled 209 million and 155 million respectively and we currently expect such contributions to be approximately 66 million for 2007 the lower contribution level in 2007 is due primarily to the merger into our pension plan of the overfunded scientific company pension plan the accounting rules applicable to our pension plan require that amounts recognized in financial statements be determined on an actuarial basis rather than as contributions are made to the plan two significant elements in determining our pension income or pension expense are the expected return on plan assets and the discount rate used in projecting pension benefit obligations declines in the stock market and lower rates of return could increase required contributions to our pension plan any decreases in interest rates if and to the extent not offset by contributions and asset returns could also increase our obligations under such plans for additional discussion of pension matters see the discussion under “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition” and notes 2 and 12 to notes to consolidated financial statements 

 

united states’ and global responses to terrorism the iraq situation and nuclear proliferation concerns increase uncertainties with respect to many of our businesses and may adversely affect our business and results of operations 

 

united states’ and global responses to terrorism the iraq situation and nuclear proliferation concerns increase uncertainties with respect to us and other business and financial markets several factors associated directly or indirectly with terrorism the iraq situation and perceived nuclear threats and responses may adversely affect us the reaction to iran’s continuing desire to explore nuclear capabilities could affect adversely oil prices and some of our businesses 

 

while some of our businesses that provide products or services to the us government experienced greater demand for their products and services as a result of increased us government defense spending various responses could realign government programs and affect the composition funding or timing of our government programs the recent changes in the leadership of the us congress could also further affect responses and government programs government spending could shift to the department of defense or homeland security programs in which we may not participate or may not have current capabilities and curtail less pressing nondefense programs in which we do participate including department of energy or nasa programs government spending could also shift towards nondefense programs in which we do not currently participate such as medical research programs of the national institutes of health 

 

air travel declines have occurred after terrorist attacks and heightened security alerts as well as after the sars and bird flu scares additional declines in air travel resulting from such factors and other factors could adversely affect the financial condition of many of our commercial airline and aircraft manufacturer customers and in turn could adversely affect our electronics and communications segment 

 

deterioration of financial performance of airlines could result in a reduction of discretionary spending for upgrades of avionics and inflight communications equipment which would adversely affect our electronics and communications segment 

 

the government continues to evaluate potential security issues associated with general aviation increased government regulations including but not limited to increased airspace regulations including user fees could lead to an overall decline in air travel and have an adverse affect on our aerospace engines and components segment as happened after the september 11th terrorist attacks reinstatement of flight restrictions would negatively impact the market for general aviation aircraft piston engines and components and our aerospace 

engines and components segment potential reductions in the need for general aviation aircraft maintenance due to declines in air travel could also adversely affect our aerospace engines and components segment 

 

higher oil prices could reduce general aviation air travel negatively affecting our aerospace engines and components segment higher oil prices could also adversely affect commercial airlinerelated customers of our electronics and communications segment conversely higher oil prices could increase oil exploration activities and bolster our marine instrumentation businesses including teledyne geophysical instruments teledyne benthos and majorityowned odi 

 

acquisitions involve inherent risks that may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

 

our growth strategy includes acquisitions acquisitions involve various inherent risks such as 

 

  

while we conduct financial and other due diligence in connection with its acquisitions and generally seeks some form of protection including indemnification from a seller and sometimes an escrow of a portion of the purchase price to cover potential issues such acquired companies may have weaknesses or liabilities that are not accurately assessed or brought to our attention at the time of the acquisition further indemnities or escrows may not fully cover such matters particularly matters identified after a closing 

 

we also have acquired several private companies such as reynolds industries incorporated “reynolds” cougar rd instruments inc and collaborx private companies generally may not have as formal or comprehensive internal controls and compliance systems in place as public companies while we have required various sellers to take certain compliance actions prior to the closing of an acquisition including with respect to export controls and have sought protections in the purchase agreement for such matters there is no assurance that we have identified all issues or will be fully protected from historic liabilities 

 

with regard to our five 2006 acquisitions while these companies’ products and customer base are complementary to some of teledyne’s existing businesses there is no assurance that we will achieve all identified financial operating and marketing synergies we may also experience problems that arise in entering new markets through acquisitions in which we may have little or no experience 

 

in connection with acquisitions we may consolidate one or more acquired facilities with other teledyne facilities to obtain synergies and costsavings for example in 2006 we relocated with minimal disruption the operations of the microwave technical solutions assets acquired from avnet inc to a teledyne cougar facility in sunnyvale california on a larger scale in 2006 we successfully consolidated into a newly leased facility in poway california the operations of 2005acquired teledyne rd instruments inc 2005acquired mgd technologies inc now part of teledyne isco and teledyne interconnect devices we are in the process of adding 2006acquired teledyne kw microwave to such facility nonetheless despite planning relocation and consolidation of manufacturing operations has inherent risks as it tends to involve among other things change of personnel application of a new business system software and learning or adaptation of manufacturing processes and techniques production delays at a new operating location could result 

 

as permitted by sec rules our current management’s report as to our assessment of the effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting includes in its scope and coverage our january 2006 acquisition of benthos but excludes our other 2006 acquisitions from its scope and coverage we plan to evaluate more fully the internal controls of these acquired companies in 2007 and implement a formal and rigorous system of internal controls at these acquired companies we can provide no assurance that we will be able to provide a report that contains no significant deficiencies or material weaknesses with respect to these acquired companies or other acquisitions 

 

our future financial results could be adversely impacted by asset impairment charges 

 

under statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” we are required to test both acquired goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis based upon a fair value approach rather than amortizing them over time we have chosen to perform our annual impairment reviews of goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year we also are required to test goodwill for impairment between annual tests if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce our enterprise fair value below its book value these events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate including a significant sustained decline in an entity’s market value legal factors operating performance indicators competition sale or disposition of a significant portion of the business or other factors if the fair market value is less than the book value of goodwill we could be required to record an impairment charge the valuation of reporting units requires judgment in estimating future cash flows discount rates and estimated product life cycles in making these judgments we evaluate the financial health of the business including such factors as industry performance changes in technology and operating cash flows as we have grown through acquisitions we have accumulated 3136 million of goodwill and have 693 million of acquired intangible assets which includes 113 of indefinitelived intangible assets out of total assets of 10602 million at december 31 2006 as a result the amount of any annual or interim impairment could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our reported financial results for the period in which the charge is taken we also may be required to record an earnings charge or incur unanticipated expenses if due to a change in strategy or other reason we determined the value of other assets has been impaired 

 

we account for the impairment of longlived assets to be held and used in accordance with sfas no 144 “accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets” “sfas no 144” sfas no 144 requires that a longlived asset to be disposed of be reported at the lower of its carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell an asset other than goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets is considered impaired when estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset in the event the carrying amount of such asset is not deemed recoverable the asset is adjusted to its estimated fair value fair value is generally determined based upon estimated discounted future cash flows 

 

we may not have sufficient resources to fund all future research and development and capital expenditures or possible acquisitions 

 

in order to remain competitive we must make substantial investments in research and development of new or enhanced products and continuously upgrade our process technology and manufacturing capabilities although we believe that anticipated cash flows from operations and available borrowings under our 4000 million credit facility will be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated working capital research and development and capital investment needs we may be unable to fund all of these needs or possible acquisitions our ability to raise additional capital will depend on a variety of factors some of which will not be within our control including the existence of a public offering market investor perceptions of us our businesses and the industries in which we operate and general economic conditions we may be unable to successfully raise additional capital if needed failure to successfully raise needed capital on a timely or costeffective basis could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

 

our indebtedness could materially and adversely affect our business 

 

as of december 31 2006 we had 2319 million in total outstanding indebtedness including 2169 million under our 400 million credit facility our indebtedness could harm our business by among other things reducing the funds available to make new strategic acquisitions our indebtedness could also have a material adverse effect on our business by increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions or a downturn in our business general adverse economic and industry conditions or a downturn in our business could result in our inability to repay this indebtedness in a timely manner 

 

we may be unsuccessful in our efforts to increase our participation in certain new markets 

 

we intend to both adapt our existing technology and develop new products to expand into new market segments for example we have been developing new fuel cell related technologies the market for fuel cell technologies is not well established and there are a number of companies that have announced intentions to develop and market fuel cell products some of these companies have greater financial andor technological resources than we do 

 

we have also been developing new electronic products including electronic flight bags highpower millimeter traveling wave tubes and imaging sonar systems which are intended to access markets in which teledyne does not currently participate or has limited participation we may be unsuccessful in accessing these and other new markets if our products do not meet our customers’ requirements due to changes in either technology and industry standards or because of actions taken by our competitors 

 

we may be unable to successfully introduce new and enhanced products in a timely and costeffective manner 

 

our operating results depend in part on our ability to introduce new and enhanced products on a timely basis successful product development and introduction depend on numerous factors including our ability to anticipate customer and market requirements changes in technology and industry standards our ability to differentiate our offerings from offerings of our competitors and market acceptance we may not be able to develop and introduce new or enhanced products in a timely and costeffective manner or to develop and introduce products that satisfy customer requirements our new products also may not achieve market acceptance or correctly anticipate new industry standards and technological changes as an example we have been working to develop high power solid state power amplifiers which could replace our traveling wave tubes in some applications and in this area there is a larger base of potential competitors than for tube amplifiers as a result it may be more difficult for our solid state power amplifier products to gain market acceptance 

 

additionally new products may trigger increased warranty costs as such products are tested further by actual usage accelerated entry of new products to meet heightened market demand and competitive pressures may cause additional warranty costs as development and testing time periods might be condensed in 2007 for example teledyne energy systems inc currently believes it will incur additional warranty costs as it continues to roll out two new hydrogen generation product lines 

 

technological change and evolving industry standards could cause certain of our products or services to become obsolete or noncompetitive 

 

the markets for a number of our products and services are generally characterized by rapid technological development evolving industry standards changes in customer requirements and new product introductions and enhancements a faster than anticipated change in one or more of the technologies related to our products or services or in market demand for products or services based on a particular technology could result in faster than anticipated obsolescence of certain of our products or services and could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition for example teledyne reynolds’ high voltage connector business could be negatively impacted by marketplace shifts to lower voltage requirements where the number of competitors is larger most lighting displays in legacy aircraft use tubes that require high 

voltage connectors led backlights which are increasingly being used for aircraft lighting displays have substantially lower voltage requirements 

 

currently accepted industry and regulatory standards are also subject to change which may contribute to the obsolescence of our products or services for example a european directive that certain electronic products must not contain impermissible levels of lead mercury cadmium hexavalent chromium polybrominated biphenyls or polybrominated diphenyl ethers recently took effect on july 1 2006 as a result we must make sure that certain of our electronic products sold into european member states comply with this new directive although many of our products are exempt from the european directive we expect that over time component manufacturers may discontinue selling components that have the restricted substances this will in turn require us to accommodate changes in parameters such as the way parts are soldered and may in some cases require redesign of certain products this could lead to increased costs which we may not be able to recover from our customers delays in product shipments and loss of market share to competitors 

 

the airline industry is heavily regulated and if we fail to comply with applicable requirements our results of operations could suffer 

 

governmental agencies throughout the world including the us federal aviation administration or the faa prescribe standards and qualification requirements for aircraft components including virtually all commercial airline and general aviation products as well as regulations regarding the repair and overhaul of aircraft engines specific regulations vary from country to country although compliance with faa requirements generally satisfies regulatory requirements in other countries we include with the products and replacement parts that we sell to our aircraft manufacturing industry customers documentation certifying that each part complies with applicable regulatory requirements and meets applicable standards of airworthiness established by the faa or the equivalent regulatory agencies in other countries in order to sell our products we and the products we manufacture must also be certified by our individual oem customers if any of the material authorizations or approvals qualifying us to supply our products is revoked or suspended then the sale of the subject product would be prohibited by law which would have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

from time to time the faa or equivalent regulatory agencies in other countries propose new regulations or changes to existing regulations which are usually more stringent than existing regulations if these proposed regulations are adopted and enacted we may incur significant additional costs to achieve compliance which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

product liability claims product recalls and field service actions could have a material adverse effect on our reputation business results of operations and financial condition 

 

as a manufacturer and distributor of a wide variety of products including aircraft engines and medical devices our results of operations are susceptible to adverse publicity regarding the quality or safety of our products in part product liability claims challenging the safety of our products may result in a decline in sales for a particular product which could adversely affect our results of operations this could be the case even if the claims themselves are proven untrue or settled for immaterial amounts 

 

while we have general liability and other insurance policies concerning product liabilities we have selfinsured retentions or deductibles under such policies with respect to a portion of these liabilities for example our current annual selfinsured retention for general aviation aircraft liabilities incurred in connection with products manufactured by teledyne continental motors inc is approximately 229 million a decrease from 250 million for the prior annual period our existing aircraft product liability insurance policy expires on may 31 2007 additionally based on facts and circumstances of claims we have not always accrued amounts up to the applicable annual selfinsured retentions additionally awarded damages could be more than our accruals 

 

product recalls can be expensive and tarnish our reputation and have a material adverse effect on the sales of our products for example teledyne continental motors had been engaged in a product recall of piston engine crankshafts as a result of which we recorded a 120 million pretax charge in the second quarter 

of 2000 in 2002 we reached a monetary settlement related to the 2000 recall with two of three companies that manufactured and processed allegedly defective steel subsequently made into aircraft engine crankshafts we failed to win a jury verdict against a third company involved in making the steel we continue to pursue cost recovery through litigation against one other materials supplier as a result of the 2000 product recall program there is no assurance that we will recover any costs 

 

through aerosance inc we have developed electronic controls known as powerlink fadec for piston aircraft engines that automate many functions requiring manual control such as fuel flow and power management while such control systems should improve engine management and facilitate maintenance of engines we could face additional claims as they become standard equipment on selected new piston engine aircraft or are retrofitted on some piston engine aircraft new products can trigger additional product liability claims as such products are further tested by actual usage additionally general aviation aircraft crash lawsuits tend to name as defendants manufacturers of a multitude of aircraftrelated products as discovery and recoveries are pursued 

 

we have been joined among a number of defendants often over 100 in lawsuits alleging injury or death as a result of exposure to asbestos we have not incurred material liabilities in connection with these lawsuits the filings typically do not identify any of our products as a source of asbestos exposure and we have been dismissed from cases for lack of product identification but only after some defense costs have been incurred also because of the prominent “teledyne” name we may be mistakenly joined in lawsuits involving a company or business that was not assumed by us as part of our 1999 spinoff our historic insurance coverage including that of its predecessors may not fully cover such claims and defense of such matters as coverage depends on the year of purported exposure and other factors nonetheless we intend to defend these claims vigorously congress from time to time has considered tort reform to deal with asbestosrelated claims but to date nothing has materialized 

 

certain gas generators manufactured by teledyne energy systems inc contain a sealed wetted asbestos component while the company has been transitioning to a replacement material has placed warning labels on its products and takes care in handling of this material by employees there is no assurance that the company will not face product liability claims involving this component 

 

our teledyne brown engineering’s laboratory in knoxville tennessee performs radiological analyses while the laboratory is certified by the department of energy and has other nuclearrelated certifications and internal quality controls in place errors and omissions in analyses may occur we currently have errors and omissions insurance coverage and nuclear liability insurance coverage that might apply depending on the circumstances we also have sought indemnities from some of our customers our insurance coverage or indemnities however may not be adequate to cover potential problems associated with faulty radiological analyses 

 

we cannot assure that we will not have additional product liability claims or that we will not recall any additional products 

 

we may have difficulty obtaining product liability and other insurance coverages or be subject to increased costs for such coverage 

 

as a manufacturer of a variety of products including aircraft engines used in general aviation aircraft we have general liability and other insurance policies that provide coverage beyond selfinsured retentions or deductibles we cannot assure that for 2007 and in future years insurance carriers will be willing to renew coverage or provide new coverage for product liability especially as it relates to general aviation over the last several years the number of insurance companies providing general aviation product liability insurance coverage has decreased if such insurance is available we may be required to pay substantially higher prices for coverage andor increase our levels of selfinsured retentions or reserves our current aircraft product liability insurance policy expires in may 2007 and has an annual selfinsured retention of approximately 229 million 

 

to offset aircraft product liability insurance costs we continue to try to reduce manufacturing and other costs and also to pass on such insurance costs through price increases on its aircraft engines and spare parts we cannot provide assurances that further cost reduction efforts will prove successful or that customers will accept additional price increases aircraft engines and spare part cost increases coupled with increased costs of insurance for general aviation aircraft owners tend to result in decreasing aftermarket sales of our piston engines this in turn leaves our aerospace engines and components segment more dependent on sales to original equipment manufacturers or oems which is more dependent on general economic conditions 

 

for certain electronic components for medical applications that we manufacture such as those that go into cochlear implants we have asked for indemnities from our customers andor to be included under their insurance policies we cannot however provide any assurance that such indemnities or insurance will offset potential liabilities that we may incur as a result of our manufacture of such components 

 

aside from the uncertainties created by external events that can affect insurance coverages such as the devastating 2005 hurricane season our ability to obtain product liability insurance and the cost for such insurance are affected by our historical claims experience while we have taken steps to improve our claims management process over the last few years we cannot assure that for 2007 and in future years our ability to obtain insurance or the cost for such insurance or the amount of selfinsured retentions or reserves will not be negatively impacted by our experience in prior years 

 

increasing competition could reduce the demand for our products and services 

 

although we believe that we have certain advantages that help us compete in our markets each of our markets is highly competitive many of our competitors have and potential competitors could have greater name recognition a larger installed base of products more extensive engineering manufacturing marketing and distribution capabilities and greater financial technological and personnel resources than we do new or existing competitors may also develop new technologies that could adversely affect the demand for our products and services industry consolidation trends particularly among aerospace and defense contractors could adversely affect demand for our products and services if prime contractors seek to control more aspects of vertically integrated projects for example the pending combination of the network activities of nokia and siemens could negatively impact our wireless transceivers business our general aviation piston engines business could face increasing competition from germanbased thielert aircraft engines gmbh as it continues to enter the us market with retrofits and attracts oems 

 

we sell products and services to customers in industries that are cyclical and sensitive to changes in general economic activity 

 

we develop and manufacture products for customers in the energy exploration market which has been cyclical and suffered from over capacity in prior years strong demand and increased prices for oil and natural gas contributed to substantial revenue growth at teledyne geophysical instruments and odi since 2003 a cyclical downturn in this market may affect future operating results particularly given our broader range of marine instrumentation businesses since 2003 

 

we derive significant revenues from the commercial aerospace industry domestic and international commercial aerospace markets are cyclical in nature historic demand for new commercial aircraft has been related to the stability and health of domestic and international economies delays or changes in aircraft and component orders could impact the future demand for our products and have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition while the market for commercial aircraft has improved since the downturn triggered by the events of september 11th and the war in iraq another such event could increase the level of uncertainty regarding future orders for aircraft 

 

in addition we sell products and services to customers in industries that are sensitive to the level of general economic activity and in mature industries that are sensitive to capacity adverse economic conditions affecting these industries may reduce demand for our products and services which may reduce our profits or our production levels or both 

 

we sell products to customers in industries that may undergo rapid and unpredictable changes 

 

we develop and manufacture products for customers in industries that have undergone rapid changes in the past for example we manufacture products and provide manufacturing services to companies that serve telecommunications markets during 2001 many segments of the telecommunications market experienced a dramatic and rapid downturn that resulted in cancellations or deferrals of orders for our products and services this market or others that we serve may exhibit rapid changes in the future and may adversely affect our operating results or our production levels or both 

 

we are subject to the risks associated with international sales 

 

during 2006 international sales accounted for approximately 21 of our total revenues as compared to 18 in 2005 and 19 in 2004 we anticipate that future international sales will continue to account for a significant percentage of our revenues risks associated with these sales include 

 

  

any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition exchange rate fluctuations may negatively affect the cost of our products to international customers and therefore reduce our competitive position that is if the us dollar strengthens against the british pound sterling or eurodollar our european customers may no longer find our product prices more attractive than european competitors 

 

concerns over theft of technology for military uses nuclear proliferation concerns terrorism and other factors have resulted in increased export scrutiny of international sales including some of our products to international customers there has also been increasing export oversight and regulation of sales to china travel restrictions to middle eastern and other countries may negatively affect continuing international sales or service revenues from such regions 

 

among other things we are subject to the foreign corrupt practices act or fcpa which generally prohibits us companies and their intermediaries from bribing foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or keeping business or otherwise obtaining favorable treatment in particular we may be held liable for actions taken by our strategic or local partners even though our partners are not subject to the fcpa any determination that we have violated the fcpa could result in sanctions that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

compliance with increasing environmental regulations and the effects of potential environmental liabilities could have a material adverse financial effect on us 

 

we like other industry participants are subject to various federal state local and international environmental laws and regulations we may be subject to increasingly stringent environmental standards in the future future developments administrative actions or liabilities relating to environmental matters could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

 

while we have as part of its overall risk management program an environmental management and compliance program applicable to its operating facilities including a “review and audit” program to monitor compliance where each facility is reviewed and audited by an internal environmental team every three years such program does not eliminate potential environmental liabilities in addition as the company continues to 

pursue acquisitions while it conducts environmentalrelated due diligence and generally seeks some form of protection including indemnification from a seller such acquired companies may have environmental liabilities that are not accurately assessed or brought to our attention at the time of the acquisition 

 

for additional discussion of environmental matters see the discussion under the caption “other matters — environmental” of “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition” and note 15 to notes to consolidated financial statements 

 

increased environmental regulatory monitoring requirements of the air we breathe and water we drink could have a favorable effect on the results of operations or financial condition of our instrumentation businesses including the sulfur dioxide carbon monoxide and ozone gas monitoring business of teledyne advanced pollution instrumentation inc and the water quality monitoring business of teledyne isco 

 

our inability to attract and retain key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our future success 

 

our future success depends to a significant extent upon the continued service of our executive officers and other key management and technical personnel and on our ability to continue to attract retain and motivate qualified personnel recruiting and retaining skilled technical and engineering personnel has become even more competitive as the domestic economy has improved in recent years also our systems engineering solutions segment has already begun to face increasing competition for qualified engineering personnel as a result of the department of defense 2005 base realignment and closure also known as brac decisions particularly as positions are moved to huntsville alabama over the next several years while we have engaged in succession planning the loss of the services of one or more of our key employees or our failure to attract retain and motivate qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

we may not be able to sell or exit on acceptable terms product lines that we determine no longer meet with our growth strategy 

 

consistent with our growth strategy to focus on markets to expand our profitable niche businesses we continually evaluate our product lines to ensure that they are aligned with our strategy for example after the june 2004 acquisition of isco inc we determined that the online process control instrumentation business of its german subsidiary was not aligned with our strategy and in march 2005 we sold this nonstrategic business in 2006 principally because of the decision of a customer to manufacture certain medical products at its facilities in india we decided to close our contract manufacturing operations in el rubi mexico and are in the process of transferring the remaining operations to our la mesa mexico facility and our lewisburg tennessee facility 

 

our ability to dispose of or exit product lines that may no longer be aligned with our growth strategy will depend on many factors including the terms and conditions of any asset purchase and sale agreement as well as industry business and economic conditions we cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to sell nonstrategic product lines on terms that are acceptable to us or at all also if the sale of any nonstrategic product line cannot be consummated or is not practical alternative courses of action including closure may not be available to us or may be more costly than anticipated 

 

provisions of our governing documents applicable law and our change in control severance agreements could make an acquisition of teledyne technologies more difficult 

 

our restated certificate of incorporation amended and restated bylaws and rights agreement and the general corporation law of the state of delaware contain several provisions that could make the acquisition of control of teledyne technologies in a transaction not approved by our board of directors more difficult we have also entered into change in control severance agreements with 15 members of our management which could have an antitakeover effect 

 

the market price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly since our spinoff from ati and could continue to do so 

 

since the spinoff on november 29 1999 the market price of our common stock has ranged from a low of 76875 to a high of 4459 per share at february 27 2007 our closing stock price was 3777 fluctuations in our stock price could continue among the factors that could affect our stock price are 

 

  

the stock markets in general and the markets for high technology companies in particular have experienced a high degree of volatility not necessarily related to the operating performance of these companies we cannot provide assurances as to our stock price 

 

our financial statements are based on estimates required by gaap and actual results may differ materially from those estimated under different assumptions or conditions 

 

our financial statements are prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states these principles require our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period for example estimates are used when accounting for items such as asset valuations allowances for doubtful accounts depreciation and amortization impairment assessments employee benefits taxes aircraft product and general liability and contingencies while we base our estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances at the time made actual results may differ materially from those estimated 

 

while we believe our control systems are effective there are inherent limitations in all control systems and misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected 

 

we continue to take action to assure compliance with the internal controls disclosure controls and other requirements of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer cannot guarantee that our internal controls and disclosure controls will prevent all possible errors or all fraud a control system no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met in addition the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefit of controls must be relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no system of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within the company have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake further controls can be circumvented by individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more persons or by management override of the controls the design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated 

goals under all potential future conditions over time a control may be inadequate because of changes in conditions or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate because of inherent limitations in a costeffective control system misstatements resulting from error or fraud may occur and may not be detected 

 

natural disasters such as a serious earthquake in california or a major hurricane in alabama or florida could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

 

several of our facilities as a result of their locations could be subject to a catastrophic loss caused by an earthquake a hurricane or a tornado many of our production facilities and our headquarters are located in california and thus are in areas with above average seismic activity in addition we have manufacturing facilities in the southeastern united states and texas that have been threatened and struck by major hurricanes our facilities in alabama florida kansas nebraska and tennessee have also been threatened by tornados while teledyne continental motors’ pistonengines manufacturing facility located in mobile alabama teledyne geophysical instruments’ facility in houston texas and odi’s facility in daytona beach florida were relatively fortunate with respect to the building damage and business interruption they suffered during the severe 2005 hurricane season there can be no assurance that any one of them will be as fortunate in the future if any of our california facilities including our california headquarters were to experience a catastrophic earthquake loss or if any of our alabama florida nebraska tennessee or texas facilities were to experience a catastrophic hurricane storm or tornado such event could disrupt our operations delay production shipments and revenue and result in large expenses to repair or replace the facility or facilities while teledyne has property insurance to partially reimburse it for losses caused by windstorm and earth movement such insurance would not cover all possible losses in addition our existing disaster recovery plans including those relating to our information technology systems may not be fully responsive to or minimize losses associated with catastrophic events

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 

 

teledyne technologies incorporated is a leading provider of sophisticated electronic components instruments and communications products including defense electronics monitoring and control instrumentation for marine environmental and industrial applications data acquisition and communications equipment for airlines and business aircraft and components and subsystems for wireless and satellite communications we also provide systems engineering solutions and information technology services for defense space and environmental applications and manufacture general aviation and missile engines and components as well as onsite gas and power generation systems 

 

we serve niche market segments where performance precision and reliability are critical our customers include government agencies aerospace prime contractors major industrial and communications companies and general aviation companies 

 

strategy 

 

our strategy continues to emphasize growth in our core markets of defense electronics instrumentation and government systems engineering we intend to strengthen and expand our core businesses with targeted acquisitions we intend to aggressively pursue operational excellence to continually improve our margins and earnings at teledyne operational excellence includes the rapid integration of the businesses we acquire over time our goal is to create a set of businesses that are truly superior in their niches we intend to continue to evaluate our product lines to ensure that they are aligned with our strategy 

 

recent acquisitions 

 

during 2006 we engaged in a number of acquisitions intended to expand and strengthen our product and service offerings in our core instruments and defense markets 

 

marine instrumentation 

 

  

defense 

 

 31 

 

  

teledyne spent 2504 million net of cash acquired on these acquisitions in 2006 

 

each of the acquisitions except for collaborx is part of the electronics and communications segment collaborx now teledyne brown collaborx inc is part of the systems engineering and solutions segment in all acquisitions the results are included in our consolidated financial statements since their respective dates of acquisition 

 

financial highlights 

 

our fiscal year is determined based on a 52 or 53week convention ending on the sunday nearest to december 31 the following is our financial information for 2006 2005 and 2004 in millions except pershare amounts 

 

 

 

 

 32 

 

we operate in four business segments electronics and communications systems engineering solutions aerospace engines and components and energy systems the segments’ respective contributions as a percentage of total sales for 2006 2005 and 2004 are summarized in the following table 

 

 

 

results of operations 

 

2006 compared with 2005 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 33

pension and postretirement plans 

 

in connection with our november 29 1999 spinoff from allegheny teledyne incorporated now known as allegheny technologies incorporated a defined benefit pension plan was established and teledyne assumed the existing pension obligations for all of the employees both active and inactive at the operations which perform government contract work and for active employees at operations which do not perform government contract work ati transferred pension assets to fund the new defined benefit pension plan as of january 1 

2004 nonunion new hires participate in an enhanced defined contribution plan as opposed to the company’s existing defined benefit plan currently teledyne anticipates making an aftertax cash contribution of approximately 40 million to its pension plans in 2007 before recovery from the us government net after tax pension cash generation after taking into consideration recovery of pension costs under certain government contracts in accordance with cas from the us government is expected to be approximately 21 million in 2007 

 

effective for yearend 2006 sfas no 158 “employers’ accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans — an amendment of fasb statements no 87 88 106 and 132r” requires companies to recognize as a component of other comprehensive income net of tax the gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that arise during the period but are not recognized as components of net periodic benefit cost pursuant to sfas no 87 or sfas no 106 employers’ accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions in accordance with the requirements of sfas no 158 the company has a 434 million noncash reduction to stockholders’ equity and a longterm additional liability of 713 million at yearend 2006 prior to 2006 sfas no 87 requires that a minimum pension liability be recorded if the value of pension assets is less than the accumulated pension benefit obligation in accordance with the requirements of sfas no 87 the company had a 389 million noncash reduction to stockholders’ equity a longterm intangible asset of 53 million and a longterm additional pension liability of 690 million at yearend 2005 the adjustments to equity did not affect net income and are recorded net of deferred taxes see note 12 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional pension disclosures 

 

other matters 

 

income taxes 

 

the company’s effective tax rate for 2006 was 340 compared with 376 for 2005 and 387 for 2004 the lower effective tax rate for 2006 compared with 2005 primarily reflected the impact of the reversal of income tax contingency reserves of 33 million in the third quarter these reserves were determined to be no longer needed due to the expiration of applicable statutes of limitations the lower effective tax rate for 2005 compared with 2004 primarily reflected the revaluation of deferred tax assets in 2004 due to the impact state income taxes rates based on the company’s history of operating earnings expectations of future operating earnings and potential tax planning strategies it is more likely than not that the deferred income tax assets at december 31 2006 will be realized 

 

costs and pricing 

 

inflationary trends in recent years have been moderate we primarily use the lastin firstout method of inventory accounting that reflects current costs in the costs of goods sold these costs the increasing costs of equipment and other costs are considered in establishing sales pricing polices the company emphasizes cost containment in all aspects of its business 

 

hedging activities market risk disclosures 

 

we have not utilized derivative financial instruments such as futures contracts options and swaps forward foreign exchange contracts or interest rate swaps and futures during 2006 or 2005 we believe that adequate controls are in place to monitor any hedging activities our primary exposure to market risk relates to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates we periodically evaluate these risks and have taken measures to mitigate these risks we own assets and operate facilities in countries that have been politically stable also our foreign risk management objectives are geared towards stabilizing cash flow from the effects of foreign currency fluctuations most of the company’s sales are denominated in us dollars which mitigates the effect of exchange rate changes borrowings under our credit facility are at fixed rates that vary with the term and timing of each loan under the facility loans under the facility typically have terms of one three or six months and the interest rate for each such loan is subject to change if the loan is continued or converted following the applicable maturity date interest rates are also subject to change based on our debt to earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda ratio as of december 31 2006 we had 

2169 million in outstanding indebtedness under our amended and restated credit facility a 100 basis point change in interest rates would result in an increase in annual interest expense of approximately 22 million assuming the 2169 million in debt was outstanding for the full year any borrowings under the company’s revolving credit line are based on a fluctuating market interest rate and consequently the fair value of any outstanding debt should not be affected materially by changes in market interest rates overall we believe that our exposure to interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange rate changes is not material to our financial condition or results of operations 

 

related party transactions 

 

in connection with the spinoff teledyne and ati entered into several agreements governing the separation of our businesses and various employee benefits compensation tax indemnification and transition arrangements the company’s principal spinoff requirements including the requirement to ensure a favorable tax treatment have been satisfied one of our directors continues to serve on ati’s board 

 

our chairman president and chief executive officer is a director of mellon financial corporation as is one of our other directors another of our directors is a former chief executive officer and director of mellon financial corporation all transactions with mellon bank na and its affiliates are effected under normal commercial terms and we believe that our relationships with mellon bank na and its affiliates are armslength mellon bank na is one of ten lenders under our 4000 million credit facility having committed up to 450 million under the facility it also provides cash management services and an uncommitted 50 million line of credit mellon bank na serves as trustee under our pension plan and through its affiliates and subsidiaries provides asset management and transition management services for the plan mellon investor services llc serves as our transfer agent and registrar as well as agent under our stockholders rights plan 

 

environmental 

 

we are subject to various federal state local and international environmental laws and regulations which require that we investigate and remediate the effects of the release or disposal of materials at sites associated with past and present operations these include sites at which teledyne has been identified as a potentially responsible party under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act commonly known as superfund and comparable state laws we are currently involved in the investigation and remediation of a number of sites reserves for environmental investigation and remediation totaled approximately 51 million at december 31 2006 and 35 million at january 1 2006 the increase was primarily due to acquisitions as investigation and remediation of these sites proceed and new information is received the company expects that accruals will be adjusted to reflect new information based on current information we do not believe that future environmental costs in excess of those already accrued will materially and adversely affect our financial condition or liquidity however resolution of one or more of these environmental matters or future accrual adjustments in any one reporting period could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations for that period 

 

for additional discussion of environmental matters see notes 2 and 15 to the notes to consolidated financial statements 

 

government contracts 

 

we perform work on a number of contracts with the department of defense and other agencies and departments of the us government including subcontracts with government prime contractors sales under these contracts with the us government which included contracts with the department of defense were approximately 40 of total sales in 2006 42 of total sales in 2005 and 43 of total sales in 2004 for a summary of sales to the us government by segment see note 13 to the notes to consolidated financial statements sales to the department of defense represented approximately 30 32 and 33 of total sales for 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively 

 

performance under government contracts has certain inherent risks that could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business results of operations and financial condition government contracts are 

conditioned upon the continuing availability of congressional appropriations which usually occurs on a fiscal year basis even though contract performance may take more than one year while us defense spending increased as a result of the september 11th terrorist attacks and the war in iraq it is currently expected to moderate over the next few years notwithstanding the recent increase in us defense spending delays or declines in us military expenditures in the programs in which we participate could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

 

for information on accounts receivable from the us government see note 5 to the notes to consolidated financial statements 

 

estimates and reserves 

 

our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent liabilities on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including those related to product returns allowance for doubtful accounts inventories intangible assets income taxes warranty obligations pension and other postretirement benefits longterm contracts environmental workers’ compensation and general liability aircraft product liability employee dental and medical benefits and other contingencies and litigation we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances at the time the results of which form the basis for making our judgments actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions in some cases such differences may be material see “other matters — critical accounting policies” 

 

the following table reflects significant reserves and valuation accounts which are estimates and based on judgments as described above at december 31 2006 and january 1 2006 

 

reserves and valuation accountsa 

 

 

 

 

  

some of the company’s products are subject to specified warranties and the company provides for the estimated cost of product warranties we regularly assess the adequacy of our preexisting warranty liabilities and adjust amounts as necessary based on a review of historic warranty experience with respect to the applicable business or products as well as the length and actual terms of the warranties which are typically 

one year the product warranty reserve is included in current accrued liabilities on the balance sheet changes in the company’s product warranty reserve are as follows in millions 

 

 

 

critical accounting policies 

 

the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with united states generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the notes to the financial statements some of those judgments can be subjective and complex and therefore actual results could differ materially from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions our critical accounting policies are those that are reflective of significant judgment complexity and uncertainty and may potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions we have identified the following as critical accounting policies contract revenue recognition and contract estimates aircraft product liability reserve accounting for pension plans and accounting for business combinations goodwill and longlived assets for additional discussion of the application of these and other accounting policies see note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

 

contract revenue recognition and contract estimates 

 

commercial sales and sales from us government fixedprice type contracts are generally recorded as shipments are made or as services are rendered occasionally for certain us government fixedprice type contracts that require substantial performance over a long time period one or more years before shipments begin in accordance with the requirements of american institute of certified public accountants statement of position 811 “accounting for performance of constructiontype and certain productiontype contracts” revenues may be recorded based upon attainment of scheduled performance milestones which could be time event or expense driven in these few instances invoices are submitted to the customer under a contractual agreement and payments are made by the customer sales under costreimbursement contracts usually from the us government are recorded as allowable costs are incurred and fees are earned 

 

the development of cost of sales percentages used to record costs under certain fixedprice type contracts and fees under certain costreimbursement type contracts requires that the company make reasonably dependable cost estimates for the design manufacture and delivery of products and services sometimes over a long time period since certain fixedprice and costreimbursement type contracts extend over a long period of time the impact of revisions in cost and funding estimates during the progress of work may adjust the current period earnings on a cumulative catchup basis if the current contract estimate indicates a loss a provision is made for the total anticipated loss in the period that it becomes evident these types of contracts and estimates are most frequently related to our sales to the us government for our sales to the us government in 2006 2005 and 2004 operating income as a percent of sales did not vary by more than 03 if operating income as a percent of sales to the us government had been higher or lower by 03 in 2006 the company’s operating income would have changed by approximately 19 million 

 

aircraft product liability reserve 

 

we are currently involved in certain legal proceedings related to aircraft product liability claims we have accrued an estimate for the probable costs for the resolution of these claims this estimate has been developed in consultation with our insurers outside counsel handling our defense in these matters and historical experience and is based upon an analysis of potential results assuming a combination of litigation and 

settlement strategies we do not believe these proceedings will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position it is possible however that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by specific events occurring in the period changes in our assumptions or the effectiveness of our strategies related to these proceedings the company has aircraft and product liability insurance however based on a review of claims experience changes to the claims management process and an analysis of available options in 2004 the company increased its annual selfinsurance retention for general aviation aircraft liabilities incurred in connection with products manufactured by teledyne continental motors to 258 million from 150 million and as a result lowered its annual insurance premium the current annual selfinsurance retention is 229 million if a significant liability claim or combination of claims were identified even taking into account insurance coverage operating profit in a given period could be reduced significantly accruals could be made in a given period for amounts up to our annual selfinsurance retention based on the facts and circumstances of the claims we have not always accrued amounts up to our annual selfinsurance retention also we cannot assure that for 2007 and in future years our ability to obtain insurance or the premiums for such insurance or the amount of our selfinsured retention or reserves will not be negatively impacted by our experience in prior years or other factors our current aircraft product liability insurance policy expires in may 2007 

 

accounting for pension plans 

 

teledyne has a defined benefit pension plan covering most of its employees the company accounts for its defined benefit pension plan in accordance with sfas no 87 “employers’ accounting for pensions” and sfas no 158 “employers’ accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans — an amendment of fasb statements no 87 88 106 and 132r” which requires that amounts recognized in financial statements be determined on an actuarial basis rather than as contributions are made to the plan a significant element in determining the company’s pension income or expense in accordance with sfas no 87 is the expected return on plan assets the company has assumed based upon the types of securities the plan assets are invested in and the longterm historical returns of these investments that the longterm expected return on pension assets will be 85 in 2007 compared with 85 in 2006 and its assumed discount rate will be 600 in 2007 compared with 600 in 2006 the actual rate of return on pension assets was 151 in 2006 and 51 in 2005 if the actual rate of return on pension assets is above the projection the company may be able to reduce its contributions to the pension trust if the actual rate of return on pension assets is below the projection the company may be required to make additional contributions to the pension trust the company made an aftertax contribution of 127 million to its pension benefit plans in 2006 and currently anticipates making an aftertax cash contribution of approximately 40 million to its pension benefit plans in 2007 before recovery from the us government the assumed longterm rate of return on assets is applied to the marketrelated value of plan assets at the end of the previous year this produces the expected return on plan assets that is included in the annual pension income or expense calculation for the current year the cumulative difference between this expected return and the actual return on plan assets is deferred and amortized into pension income or expense over future periods in accordance with the requirements of sfas no 158 the company has a 434 million noncash reduction to stockholders’ equity and a longterm additional liability of 713 million at yearend 2006 prior to 2006 sfas no 87 requires that a minimum pension liability be recorded if the value of pension assets is less than the accumulated pension benefit obligation in accordance with the requirements of sfas no 87 the company had a 389 million noncash reduction to stockholders’ equity a longterm intangible asset of 53 million and a longterm additional pension liability of 690 million at yearend 2005 the adjustments to equity did not affect net income and are recorded net of deferred taxes see note 12 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional pension disclosures 

 

differences in the discount rate and expected longterm rate of return on assets within the indicated range would have had the following impact on 2006 results 

 

 

 

see note 12 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional pension disclosures 

 

accounting for business combinations goodwill and other longlived assets 

 

the company accounts for goodwill and purchased intangible assets under sfas no 141 “business combinations” and sfas no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” in all acquisitions the results are included in the company’s consolidated financial statements from the date of each respective acquisition business acquisitions are accounted for under the purchase method by assigning the purchase price to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at their fair values and the excess of the purchase price over the amounts assigned is recorded as goodwill purchased intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives 

 

goodwill and acquired intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized we review goodwill and acquired indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable the company also performs an annual impairment test in the fourth quarter of each year based on the annual impairment test completed in the fourth quarter of 2006 no impairment of goodwill or intangible assets with indefinite lives was indicated the company estimates the fair value of the reporting units which are our four business segments using a discounted cash flow model based on our best estimate of amounts and timing of future revenues and cash flows and our most recent business and strategic plans and compares the estimated fair value to the net book value of the reporting unit including goodwill the development of future revenues and cash flows projections for our business and strategic plan and the annual impairment test involve significant judgments changes in these projections could affect the estimated fair value of certain of the company’s reporting units and could result in a goodwill impairment charge in a future period however a 10 percent decrease in the current fair value estimate of each of the company’s reporting units would not result in a goodwill impairment charge 

 

we monitor the recoverability of the carrying value of our longlived assets an impairment charge is recognized when events and circumstances indicate that the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by an asset including any proceeds from dispositions are less than the carrying value of the asset and the asset’s carrying value is less than its fair value our cash flow estimates are based on historical results adjusted to reflect our best estimate of future market and operating conditions the net carrying value of assets not recoverable is reduced to fair value our estimates of fair value represent our best estimate based on industry trends and reference to market rates and transactions our determination of what constitutes an indication of possible impairment the estimation of future cash flows and the determination of estimated fair value are all significant judgments 

 

recent accounting pronouncements 

 

sfas no 158 

 

in september 2006 the fasb issued sfas no 158 “employers’ accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans an amendment of fasb statements no 87 88 106 and 132r” “sfas no 158” which provides guidance for recognition of a net liability or asset to report the funded status of company defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans collectively referred to herein as “benefit plans” on company balance sheets the pronouncement clarifies 1 recognition of the funded status of a benefit plan in its statement of financial position 2 recognition as a component of other comprehensive income net of tax the gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that arise during the 

period but are not recognized as components of net periodic benefit cost pursuant to fasb statement no 87 “employers’ accounting for pensions” or no 106 “employers’ accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions” 3 measurement of defined benefit plan assets and obligations as of the date of the employer’s fiscal yearend statement of financial position with limited exceptions and 4 disclosure requirements in the notes to financial statements with additional information about certain effects on net periodic benefit cost for the next fiscal year that arise from delayed recognition of the gains or losses prior service costs or credits and transition asset or obligation sfas no 158 is effective as of the end of the fiscal year ending after december 15 2006 the impact of the adoption of sfas no 158 increased the minimum benefit plan liability component of stockholders’ equity by 411 million at december 31 2006 this increase was mostly offset by the impact of the changes to teledyne’s pension assets and liabilities resulting from the merger of the scientific company pension plan with teledyne’s pension plan following the acquisition of scientific company the total increase from 2005 in the minimum pension liability component of stockholders’ equity was 45 million the adoption of sfas no 158 is not expected to have a material impact to pension expense over the next 5 years 

 

fin 48 

 

in july 2006 the fasb issued interpretation no 48 “accounting for uncertainty in income taxes” “fin 48” this interpretation among other things creates a two step approach for evaluating uncertain tax positions recognition step one occurs when an enterprise concludes that a tax position based solely on its technical merits is morelikelythannot to be sustained upon examination measurement step two determines the amount of benefit that morelikelythannot will be realized upon settlement derecognition of a tax position that was previously recognized would occur when a company subsequently determines that a tax position no longer meets the morelikelythannot threshold of being sustained fin 48 specifically prohibits the use of a valuation allowance as a substitute for derecognition of tax positions and it has expanded disclosure requirements fin 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2006 in which the impact of adoption should be accounted for as a cumulativeeffect adjustment to the beginning balance of retained earnings the company is currently evaluating fin 48 and has not yet determined the impact the adoption may have on the consolidated financial statements 

 

sfas no 154 

 

on january 2 2006 we adopted sfas no 154 “accounting changes and error corrections disclosure” “sfas no 154” sfas no 154 replaces apb opinion no 20 “accounting changes” and sfas no 3 “reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements” sfas no 154 requires retrospective application to prior periods’ financial statements of changes in accounting principle unless it is impracticable sfas no 154 applies to all voluntary changes in accounting principle it also applies to changes required by a new accounting pronouncement in the unusual instance that the pronouncement does not include explicit transition provisions the adoption of sfas no 154 did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements of the company 

 

sfas no 123r 

 

in december 2004 the fasb issued sfas no 123r that requires compensation costs related to sharebased payment transactions to be recognized in the financial statements with limited exceptions the amount of compensation costs will be measured based on the grant date fair value of the equity or liability instrument issued compensation cost will be recognized over the period that an employee provides service in exchange for the award sfas no 123r replaces sfas no 123 “accounting for stockbased compensation” and supersedes apb opinion no 25 “accounting for stock issued to employees” the company adopted sfas no 123r effective january 2 2006 using the modified prospective method and accordingly did not restate prior year financial statements no modifications to outstanding stock options were made prior to the adoption of sfas no 123r the valuation methodologies and assumptions in estimating the fair value of stock options granted in 2006 were similar to those used in estimating the fair value of stock options granted in 2005 stock option compensation expense is recorded on a straight line basis over the appropriate vesting 

period generally three years for the fiscal year 2006 the company recorded a total of 59 million in its consolidated statements of income for stock option expense related to stock options awarded after the adoption of sfas no 123r and for stock options which were not vested by the date of adoption of sfas no 123r no compensation expense related to stock options was recorded in the consolidated statements of income for 2005 or in prior years since it was not required during the fiscal year 2006 the total intrinsic value of stock options exercised was 221 million as of december 31 2006 there was 61 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested stock options which is expected to be recognized over a weightedaverage period of approximately 13 years the company issues shares of common stock upon the exercise of stock options 

 

we used a combination of the historical volatility of teledyne’s stock price and the implied volatility based on the price of traded options on teledyne’s stock to calculate the expected volatility assumption to value stock options we used our actual stock trading history since january 2001 in the volatility calculation the expected dividend yield is based on teledyne’s practice of not paying dividends the riskfree rate of return is based on the yield of us treasury strips with terms equal to the expected life of the option as of the grant date the expected life in years is based on historical actual stock option exercise experience 

 

sfas no 151 

 

on january 2 2006 we adopted sfas no 151 “inventory costs — an amendment of arb no 43 chapter 4” “sfas no 151” sfas no 151 amends the guidance in arb no 43 chapter 4 “inventory pricing” to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense freight handling costs and wasted material spoilage sfas no 151 requires that those items be recognized as currentperiod charges the adoption of sfas no 151 did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements of the company 

 

outlook 

 

based on its current outlook the company’s management believes that first quarter 2007 earnings per share will be in the range of approximately 047 to 051 the full year 2007 earnings per share outlook is expected to be in the range of approximately 233 to 238 our estimated effective income tax rate for 2007 is expected to be 356 and reflects the anticipated receipt of tax credits ranging from 28 million to 38 million or 008 to 010 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2007 excluding the receipt of the tax credits our estimated effective income tax rate for 2007 would be 376 

 

our 2007 outlook reflects anticipated sales growth in our defense electronics and instrumentation businesses due primarily to the contribution of the acquisitions completed in 2006 our first quarter and full year 2007 earnings per diluted share outlook reflects an anticipated increase in expenses such as intangible asset amortization as a result of the acquisitions completed in 2006 in addition sales of geophysical sensors are currently expected to decline in 2007 compared with 2006 especially in the first half of the year 

 

the full year 2007 earnings outlook includes approximately 122 million in pension expense under sfas no 87 and no 158 or 20 million in net pension expense after recovery of allowable pension costs from our cas covered government contracts full year 2006 earnings included 154 million in pension expense under sfas no 87 and no 158 or 49 million in net pension expense after recovery of allowable pension costs from our cas covered government contracts the decrease in full year 2007 pension expense reflects pension contributions made in 2006 the impact of favorable market returns on plan assets and changes to the company’s pension assets and liabilities resulting from the merger of the scientific company pension plan with the teledyne technologies pension plan following the acquisition of scientific company 

 

our 2007 earnings outlook also reflects 67 million 012 per diluted share in stock option compensation expense based on the fair value of stock options granted after the adoption of sfas no 123r and stock options which were not vested by the date of adoption of sfas no 123r as well as current assumptions regarding the estimated fair value of expected stock option grants during the year the company’s 2006 earnings included 59 million 010 per diluted share in stock option compensation expense

  we have a line of fuel cell test stations designed to provide a completely integrated system for fuel cell testing for the pem fuel cell development market our medusa line of fuel cell test systems provides high quality simple to use automated test stations for fuel cell and fuel cell stack testing up to 12 kilowatts 

  in 2005 we successfully supplied nasa with a 12 kilowatt pem full cell engineering unit and have obtained additional work from nasa to continue development of advanced pem fuel cell technologies for space 

8 customers 

  we have hundreds of customers in the electronics communications aerospace and defense industries no commercial customer accounted for more than 10 of our total sales during 2005 2004 or 2003 

  approximately 42 43 and 46 of our total sales for 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively were derived from contracts with agencies of and prime contractors to the us government our principal us government customer is the us department of defense these sales represented 32 33 and 31 of our total sales for 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively in 2005 our largest program with the us government was the systems engineering and technical assistance contract with the space and missile defense command and it represented 55 of total sales in 2004 and 2003 our largest program with the us government was the boeing company — groundbased midcourse defense contract representing 54 and 58 of total sales respectively set forth below are sales by our segments to agencies and prime contractors to the us government for the periods presented 

us government sales 

   our total backlog of confirmed orders was approximately 5219 million at january 1 2006 4713 million at january 2 2005 and 3697 million at december 28 2003 we expect to fulfill 99 of such backlog of confirmed orders during 2006 

sales and marketing 

  our sales and marketing approach varies by segment and by products within our segments a shared fundamental tenet is the commitment to work closely with our customers to understand their needs with an aim to secure preferred supplier and longerterm relationships 

  our business segments use a combination of internal sales forces distributors and commissioned sales representatives to market and sell our products and services as part of ongoing acquisition integration efforts some of our teledyne instruments companies have been consolidating internal sales and servicing efforts 

  products are also advertised in appropriate trade journals and by means of various websites to promote our products and other capabilities our personnel regularly participate in relevant trade shows and professional associations 

  many of our government contracts are awarded after a competitive bidding process in which we seek to emphasize our ability to provide superior products and technical solutions in addition to competitive pricing 

  through teledyne technologies international corp and other subsidiaries the company has established branch offices in foreign countries to facilitate international sales for various businesses 

9 competition 

  we believe that technological capabilities and innovation and the ability to invest in the development of new and enhanced products are critical to obtaining and maintaining leadership in our markets and the industries in which we compete although we have certain advantages that we believe help us compete effectively in our markets each of our markets is highly competitive our businesses vigorously compete on the basis of quality product performance and reliability technical expertise price and service many of our competitors have and potential competitors could have greater name recognition a larger installed base of products more extensive engineering manufacturing marketing and distribution capabilities and greater financial technological and personnel resources than we do 

research and development 

  our research and development efforts primarily involve engineering and design related to improving product lines and developing new products and technologies in the same or similar fields we spent a total of 2915 million 2633 million and 2181 million on research and development and bid and proposal costs for 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively customerfunded research and development most of which was attributable to work under contracts with the us government represented approximately 85 88 and 87 of total research and development costs for 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively 

  in 2005 approximately 736 of the 449 million in companyfunded research and development and bid and proposal costs were incurred in our electronics and communications businesses we expect the level of companyfunded research and development and bid and proposal costs to be approximately 544 million in 2006 

intellectual property 

  while we own and control various intellectual property rights including patents trade secrets confidential information trademarks trade names and copyrights which in the aggregate are of material importance to our business our management believes that our business as a whole is not materially dependent upon any one intellectual property or related group of such properties we own several hundred active patents and are licensed to use certain patents technology and other intellectual property rights owned and controlled by others similarly other companies are licensed to use certain patents technology and other intellectual property rights owned and controlled by us 

  patents patent applications and license agreements will expire or terminate over time by operation of law in accordance with their terms or otherwise we do not expect the expiration or termination of these patents patent applications and license agreements to have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

employees 

  our total current workforce consists of approximately 7270 employees the international union of united automobile aerospace and agricultural implement workers of america represents approximately 265 active employees in mobile alabama under a collective bargaining agreement that expires by its terms on february 20 2007 this union also represents approximately 15 of our active employees in toledo ohio under a collective bargaining agreement that expires by its terms on november 9 2006 we consider our relations with our employees to be good 

10 executive management 

  teledyne’s executive management includes 

 11   

   dr mehrabian and teledyne have entered into a second amended and restated employment agreement dated as of january 24 2006 the agreement provides that we will employ him as the chairman president and chief executive officer the agreement terminates on december 31 2006 but will automatically be extended annually unless either party gives the other written notice prior to october 31 of the year of such term that it will not be extended under the agreement dr mehrabian’s annual base salary is 700003 the agreement provides that dr mehrabian is entitled to participate in teledyne’s annual incentive bonus plan and other executive compensation and benefit programs the agreement provides dr mehrabian with a nonqualified pension arrangement under which teledyne will pay him starting six months following his retirement as payments supplemental to any accrued pension under our qualified pension plan an amount equal to 50 of his base compensation as in effect at retirement the number of years for which such annual amount shall be paid will be equal to the number of years of his service to teledyne including service to ati but not more than 10 years 

  fifteen current members of management have entered into change in control severance agreements with teledyne the agreements have a threeyear automatically renewing term under the agreements the executive is entitled to severance benefits if 1 there is a change in control of teledyne and 2 within three months before or 24 months after the change in control either we terminate the executive’s 

12 employment for reasons other than for cause or the executive terminates employment for good reason “severance benefits” consist of 

 




 item 1a risk factors 

risk factors cautionary statement as to forwardlooking statements 

  the following text highlights various risks and uncertainties associated with teledyne these factors could materially affect “forwardlooking statements” within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 that we may from time to time make including forwardlooking statements contained in “item 1 business” and “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation” of this form 10k and in teledyne’s 2005 annual report to stockholders it is not possible for management to predict all of such factors and new factors may emerge additionally management cannot assess the impact of each such factor on teledyne or the extent to which any factor or combination of factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forwardlooking statements 

our dependence on revenue from government contracts subjects us to many risks including the risk that we may not be successful in bidding for future contracts and the risk that us government funding for our existing contracts may be diverted to other uses or delayed 

  we perform work on a number of contracts with the department of defense and other agencies and departments of the us government including subcontracts with government prime contractors sales under contracts with the us government as a whole including sales under contracts with the department of defense as prime contractor or subcontractor represented approximately 42 of our total 

13 revenue for 2005 as compared to 43 and 46 of our total revenue for 2004 and 2003 respectively performance under government contracts has certain inherent risks that could have a material effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

  government contracts are conditioned upon the continuing availability of congressional appropriations congress typically appropriates funds for a given program on a fiscalyear basis even though contract performance may take more than one year as a result at the beginning of a major program a contract is typically only partially funded and additional monies are normally committed to the contract by the procuring agency only as congress makes appropriations available for future fiscal years 

  while us defense spending increased as a result of the september 11th terrorist attacks and the war in iraq it is currently expected to moderate over the next few years hurricane relief efforts the continued war on terrorism and the middle east situation could result in a diversion of funds from programs in which teledyne participates also continued defense spending does not necessarily correlate to continued business for the company because not all the programs in which teledyne participates or has current capabilities may be provided with continued funding 

  our electronics and communications segment provides a variety of products for newer military platforms such as the f a22 aircraft and f35 aircraft development and production of these aircrafts are very expensive and there is no guarantee that the department of defense as it balances budget priorities will continue to provide funding to manufacture and support these platforms 

  also over time and for a variety of reasons programs can evolve and affect the extent of our participation for example teledyne brown engineering’s groundbased midcourse defense program was restructured in 2003 to change the emphasis from a focus on test and evaluation to a focus on deployment and sustainment this resulted in a nearly 16 decline in revenues from this contract that year compared to 2002 from 58 million to 49 million then in 2004 and 2005 revenues related to this program totaled approximately 54 million and 51 million respectively with the increases over 2003 resulting from unanticipated ground tests the company expects revenues from this program to decline further in 2006 

  in addition the us missile defense agency or mda has been undergoing changes that could affect our systems engineering solution segment the mda is in the process of relocating personnel from the washington dc area to huntsville alabama it is difficult to predict the effects of such move and the efficiencies and costssavings that the us government will try to extract from such relocation including possible consolidation with functions of the us army space and missile defense command and other government units further a new director has begun additional restructuring of the groundbased midcourse defense program and redefining roles of program participants and it is too early to tell the impact of such changes 

  the company principally and traditionally through its systems engineering solutions segment has been a significant participant in nasa programs the centerpiece of our current nasa activities is the international space station while the company anticipates participating in nasa’s lunar and interplanetary exploration activities funding for these activities may be reduced to the extent additional funding is sought to return the space shuttle to flight 

  furthermore we obtain many us government prime contracts and subcontracts through the process of competitive bidding we may not be successful in having our bids accepted 

  until november 29 2004 under one of our spinoff agreements we were not able to charge pension costs to the us government under our various government contracts since such date we have been able to charge these pension costs the addition of such costs in a bid for us government contracts which is in essence an increase to the contract price to be paid may itself negatively affect an award decision being made to the company 

  most of our us government contracts are subject to termination by the us government either at its convenience or upon the default of the contractor terminationforconvenience provisions provide only for the recovery of costs incurred or committed settlement expenses and profit on work completed prior to 

14 termination terminationfordefault clauses impose liability on the contractor for excess costs incurred by the us government in reprocuring undelivered items from another source during 2005 other than a small contract of teledyne reynolds relating to the us navy’s fleet ballistic trident ii d5 program no us government contract was terminated for convenience we did not have any of our us government contracts terminated for default during 2005 

  there is no guarantee that us government contracts will be profitable a number of our us government prime contracts and subcontracts are fixedprice type contracts 47 in 2005 as compared to 43 in 2004 and 44 in 2003 under these types of contracts we bear the inherent risk that actual performance cost may exceed the fixed contract price this is particularly true where the contract was awarded and the price finalized in advance of final completion of design 

  certain fees under some of our us government contracts are linked to meeting development or testing deadlines fees may also be influenced or dependent on the collective efforts and success of other defense contractors over which we have no or limited control 

  we like other government contractors are subject to various audits reviews and investigations including private party “whistleblower” lawsuits relating to our compliance with federal and state laws we have a compliance program designed to surface issues that may lead to voluntary disclosures of contracting irregularities to the us government generally claims arising out of these us government inquiries and voluntary disclosures can be resolved without resorting to litigation however should the business unit or division involved be charged with wrongdoing or should the us government determine that the unit or division is not a “presently responsible contractor” that unit or division and conceivably our company as a whole could be temporarily suspended or in the event of a conviction could be debarred for up to three years from receiving new government contracts or governmentapproved subcontracts in addition we could expend substantial amounts in defending against such charges and in damages fines and penalties if such charges are proven or result in negotiated settlements in october 2002 the company was informed that the us government had declined to intervene in a lawsuit filed under seal pursuant to the false claims act more than four years before our electronic safety products unit’s involvement in this civil action is over as a result of favorable court decisions 

a declining stock market and lower interests rates negatively affect the value of our pension assets and could have a material adverse financial effect on us 

  we have a defined benefit pension plan covering most of our employees at yearend 2005 notwithstanding improved market conditions the value of the pension assets was less than our accumulated pension benefit obligation the accounting rules applicable to our pension plan require that amounts recognized in financial statements be determined on an actuarial basis rather than as contributions are made to the plan two significant elements in determining our pension income or pension expense are the expected return on plan assets and the discount rate used in projecting pension benefit obligations we have assumed based on the type of securities in which the plan assets are invested and the longterm historical returns of these investments that the longterm expected return on pension assets will continue to be 85 in 2006 as it was in both 2005 and 2004 and the assumed discount rate will be 600 in 2006 compared to 625 in 2005 and 650 in 2004 the actual rate of return on pension assets was 51 in 2005 and 98 in 2004 

  since the spinoff through 2002 as a result of favorable market conditions we recorded pension income in 2003 we began to incur pension expense and we expect to continue to incur pension expense the decline in pension income and the start of pension expense in 2003 is due to the completion in 2001 of income amortization associated with the transition assets recorded pursuant to statement of financial accounting standards no 87 — “employee’s accounting for pensions” as well as the decline in the value of our pension assets coupled with reductions in our expected rate of return and discount rate assumptions used for pension plan calculations as described above projected earnings for 2006 are expected to include approximately 164 million in pension expense under sfas no 87 or 66 million in net pension expense after recovery of allowable pension costs from our cas covered government contracts earnings 

15 for 2005 included 127 million in pension expense under sfas no 87 or 34 million in net pension expense after recovery of allowable pension costs from our cascovered government contracts the projected increase in 2006 pension expense reflects in part the reduction of the discount rate assumption for our defined benefit pension plan from 625 in 2005 to 600 in 2006 since november 29 2004 under one of our spinoff agreements we are able to charge pension costs to the us government under certain government contracts pension expense determined under cas can generally be recovered through the pricing of products and services sold to the us government effective january 1 2004 in an effort to reduce pension expense in future years new nonunion employee hires do not participate in the defined benefit pension plan but participate in an enhanced teledyne technologies incorporated 401k plan 

  given our pension plan’s underfunded status in 2004 we began making required cash contributions to our pension plan for 2005 and 2004 cash contributions for this defined benefit plan totaled 148 million and 31 million respectively and we currently expect such contributions to be approximately 188 million for 2006 declines in the stock market and lower rates of return could further increase future years required contributions to our pension plan 

united states’ and global responses to terrorism the middle east situation and nuclear proliferation concerns increase uncertainties with respect to many of our businesses and may adversely affect the company’s business and results of operations 

  united states’ and global responses to terrorism the middle east situation and nuclear proliferation concerns increase uncertainties with respect to us and other business and financial markets several factors associated directly or indirectly with terrorism the iraq situation and perceived nuclear threats and responses may adversely affect the company the reaction to iran’s stated desire to explore nuclear capabilities could adversely affect oil prices and some of the company’s businesses 

  while some of our businesses that provide products or services to the us government experienced greater demand as a result of increased us government defense spending various responses could realign government programs and affect the composition funding or timing of our government programs government spending could shift to the department of defense or homeland security programs in which we may not participate or may not have current capabilities and this shift could curtail less pressing nondefense programs in which we do participate including department of energy or nasa programs 

  the effect of the decline in air travel on the financial condition of many of our commercial airline and aircraft manufacturer customers resulting from terrorism a sars or bird flu scare and other factors could adversely affect our electronics and communications segment 

  continued deterioration of financial performance of airlines could result in reduction of discretionary spending for upgrades of avionics and inflight communications equipment which would adversely affect our electronics and communications segment 

  the government continues to evaluate potential security issues associated with general aviation increased government regulations including but not limited to increased airspace regulations could lead to an overall decline in air travel and have an adverse affect on our aerospace engines and components segment as happened after the september 11th terrorist attacks reinstatement of flight restrictions would negatively impact the market for general aviation aircraft piston engines and components and our aerospace engines and components segment potential reductions in the need for general aviation aircraft maintenance due to declines in air travel could also adversely affect our aerospace engines and components segment 

  higher oil prices could reduce general aviation air travel negatively affecting our aerospace engines and components segment higher oil prices could also adversely affect commercial airlinerelated customers of our electronics and communications segment conversely higher oil prices could increase oil exploration activities and bolster the businesses of teledyne geophysical instruments and teledyne benthos inc 

16 acquisitions involve inherent risks that may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

  our growth strategy includes acquisitions acquisitions involve various inherent risks such as 

   while the company conducts financial and other due diligence in connection with its acquisitions and generally seeks some form of protection including indemnification from a seller and sometimes an escrow of a portion of the purchase price to cover potential issues such acquired companies may have weaknesses or liabilities that are not accurately assessed or brought to our attention at the time of the acquisition further indemnities or escrows may not fully cover such matters particularly matters identified after a closing 

  we also have acquired several private companies such as reynolds industries incorporated cougar components corporation and rd instruments inc private companies generally may not have internal controls and compliance systems in place that are as formal or comprehensive as those of public companies while the company has required various sellers to take certain compliance actions prior to the closing of an acquisition including actions relating export controls and has sought protections in the purchase agreement for such matters there is no assurance that we have identified all issues or will be fully protected from historic liabilities 

  with regard to our 2005 acquisitions and our most recent acquisition of benthos inc while these companies’ products and customer base are complementary to some of teledyne’s existing businesses there is no assurance that we will achieve all identified financial operating and marketing synergies 

  in connection with acquisitions we may consolidate one or more acquired facilities with other teledyne facilities to obtain synergies and costsavings for example we recently relocated the operations of the microwave technical solutions assets acquired from avnet inc to a teledyne cougar facility in sunnyvale california despite planning relocation of manufacturing operations has inherent risks as it tends to involve among other things change of personnel application of a new business system software and learning or adaptation of manufacturing processes and techniques production delays at the new operating location could result 

  as permitted by sec rules our current management’s report as to our assessment of the effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting excludes our 2005 acquisitions from its scope and coverage we plan to evaluate more fully the internal controls of these acquired companies in 2006 and implement a formal and rigorous system of internal controls at these acquired companies the company can provide no assurance that we will be able to provide a report that contains no material weaknesses with respect to these acquired companies or other acquisitions 

we may not have sufficient resources to fund all future research and development and capital expenditures or possible acquisitions 

  in order to remain competitive we must make substantial investments in research and development of new or enhanced products and continuously upgrade our process technology and manufacturing capabilities 

17   although we believe that anticipated cash flows from operations and available borrowings under our 2800 million credit facility will be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated working capital research and development and capital investment needs we may be unable to fund all of these needs or possible acquisitions our ability to raise additional capital will depend on a variety of factors some of which will not be within our control including the existence of a public offering market investor perceptions of our businesses and the industries in which we operate and general economic conditions we may be unable to successfully raise additional capital if needed failure to successfully raise needed capital on a timely or costeffective basis could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

we may be unsuccessful in our efforts to increase our participation in certain new markets 

  we intend to both adapt our existing technology and develop new products to expand into new market segments for example we have been developing new fuel cell related technologies the market for fuel cell technologies is not well established and there are a number of companies that have announced intentions to develop and market fuel cell products some of these companies have greater financial andor technological resources than we do 

  we have also been developing new electronic products including electronic flight bags highpower millimeter traveling wave tubes and imaging sonar systems which are intended to access markets in which teledyne does not currently participate or has limited participation we may be unsuccessful in accessing these markets if our products do not meet our customers’ requirements due to either changes in technology and industry standards or because of actions taken by our competitors 

we may be unable to successfully introduce new and enhanced products in a timely and costeffective manner 

  our operating results depend in part on our ability to introduce new and enhanced products on a timely basis successful product development and introduction depend on numerous factors including our ability to anticipate customer and market requirements changes in technology and industry standards our ability to differentiate our offerings from offerings of our competitors and market acceptance 

  we may not be able to develop and introduce new or enhanced products in a timely and costeffective manner or to develop and introduce products that satisfy customer requirements our new products also may not achieve market acceptance or correctly anticipate new industry standards and technological changes 

  additionally new products may trigger increased warranty costs as such products are tested further by actual usage accelerated entry of new products to meet heightened market demand and competitive pressures may cause additional warranty costs as development and testing time periods might be condensed 

technological change and evolving industry standards could cause certain of our products or services to become obsolete or noncompetitive 

  the markets for a number of our products and services are generally characterized by rapid technological development evolving industry standards changes in customer requirements and new product introductions and enhancements a faster than anticipated change in one or more of the technologies related to our products or services or in market demand for products or services based on a particular technology could result in faster than anticipated obsolescence of certain of our products or services and could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operation and financial condition for example teledyne reynolds inc’s high voltage connector business could be negatively impacted by marketplace shifts to lower voltage requirements where the number of competitors is larger also most lighting displays in legacy aircraft use tubes that require high voltage connectors led backlights which are increasingly being used for aircraft lighting displays have substantially lower voltage requirements 

18   currently accepted industry standards are also subject to change which may contribute to the obsolescence of our products or services in this respect the company has been working to make sure that certain of its electronic products sold into european member states comply with a directive not to contain impermissible levels of lead mercury cadmium hexavalent chromium polybrominated biphenyls or polybrominated diphenyl ethers on or after july 1 2006 although many of our products are exempt from the european directive we expect that over time component manufacturers may discontinue selling components that have the restricted substances this will in turn require teledyne to accommodate changes in parameters such as the way parts are soldered and may in some cases require redesign of certain products 

product liability claims or recalls could have a material adverse effect on our reputation business results of operations and financial condition 

  as a manufacturer and distributor of a wide variety of products our results of operations are susceptible to adverse publicity regarding the quality or safety of our products in part product liability claims challenging the safety of our products may result in a decline in sales for a particular product which could adversely affect our results of operations this could be the case even if the claims themselves are proven untrue or settled for immaterial amounts 

  while we have general liability and other insurance policies concerning product liabilities we have selfinsured retentions or deductibles under such policies with respect to a portion of these liabilities for example our current annual selfinsured retention for general aviation aircraft liabilities incurred in connection with products manufactured by teledyne continental motors inc is 250 million additionally based on facts and circumstances of claims we have not always accrued amounts up to the applicable annual selfinsured retentions 

  product recalls and field service actions could also have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition for example teledyne continental motors had been engaged in a product recall of piston engine crankshafts whereby the company recorded a 120 million pretax charge in the second quarter of 2000 product recalls have the potential for tarnishing a company’s reputation and could have a material adverse effect on the sales of our products in 2002 we reached a monetary settlement related to the 2000 recall with two of three companies that manufactured and processed allegedly defective steel subsequently made into aircraft engine crankshafts we failed to win a jury verdict against a third company involved in making the steel the company continues to pursue cost recovery through litigation against one other materials supplier as a result of the 2000 product recall program there is no assurance that the company will recover any additional costs 

  the company has been joined among a number of defendants often over 100 in lawsuits alleging injury or death as a result of exposure to asbestos we have not incurred material liabilities in connection with these lawsuits the filings typically do not identify any of the company’s products as a source of asbestos exposure and the company has been dismissed from cases for lack of product identification but only after some defense costs have been incurred also because of the prominent “teledyne” name we may be mistakenly joined in lawsuits involving a company or business that was not assumed by us as part of our 1999 spinoff the company’s historic insurance coverage including that of its predecessors may not fully cover such matters as coverage depends on the year of purported exposure and other factors nonetheless the company intends to defend these claims vigorously congress continues to consider legislative reform to deal with asbestosrelated claims 

  certain gas generators manufactured by teledyne energy systems inc contain a sealed wetted asbestos component while the company has been transitioning to a replacement material has placed warning labels on its products and takes care in handling of this material by employees there is no assurance that the company will not face product liability claims involving this component 

  our teledyne brown engineering’s laboratory in knoxville tennessee performs radiological analyses while the laboratory is certified by the department of energy and has other nuclearrelated certifications and internal quality controls in place errors and omissions in analyses may occur we currently have errors 

19 and omissions insurance coverage and nuclear liability insurance coverage that might apply depending on the circumstances we also have sought indemnities from some of our customers our insurance coverage or indemnities however may not be adequate to cover potential problems associated with faulty radiological analyses 

  we cannot assure that we will not have additional product liability claims or that we will not recall any additional products 

we may have difficulty obtaining product liability and other insurance coverages or be subject to increased costs for such coverage 

  as a manufacturer of a variety of products including aircraft engines used in general aviation aircraft we have general liability and other insurance policies that provide coverage beyond selfinsured retentions or deductibles we cannot assure that for 2006 and in future years insurance carriers will be willing to renew coverage or provide new coverage for product liability especially as it relates to general aviation if such insurance is available we may be required to pay substantially higher prices for coverage andor increase our levels of selfinsured retentions or reserves the company’s current aircraft product liability insurance policy expires in may 2006 and has an annual selfinsured retention of 250 million 

  to offset aircraft product liability insurance costs the company continues to try to reduce manufacturing and other costs and also to pass on such insurance costs through price increases on its aircraft engines and spare parts the company cannot provide assurances that further cost reduction efforts will prove successful or that customers will accept additional price increases 

  for certain electronic components for medical applications that we manufacture such as those that go into cochlear implants we have asked for indemnities from our customers andor to be included under their insurance policies we cannot however provide assurance that such indemnities or insurance will offset potential liabilities that we may incur as a result of our manufacture of such components 

  aside from the uncertainties created by external events that can affect insurance coverages such as the 2005 devastating hurricane season our ability to obtain product liability insurance and the cost for such insurance are affected by our historical claims experience while the company has taken steps to improve its claims management process over the last few years we cannot assure that for 2006 and in future years our ability to obtain insurance or the cost for such insurance or the amount of selfinsured retentions or reserves will not be negatively impacted by our experience in prior years 

increasing competition could reduce the demand for our products and services 

  although we believe that we have certain advantages that help us compete in our markets each of our markets is highly competitive many of our competitors have and potential competitors could have greater name recognition a larger installed base of products more extensive engineering manufacturing marketing and distribution capabilities and greater financial technological and personnel resources than we do new or existing competitors may also develop new technologies that could adversely affect the demand for our products and services industry consolidation trends particularly among aerospace and defense contractors could adversely affect demand for our products and services if prime contractors seek to control more aspects of vertically integrated projects 

we sell products and services to customers in industries that are cyclical and sensitive to changes in general economic activity 

  we derive significant revenues from the commercial aerospace industry domestic and international commercial aerospace markets are cyclical in nature historic demand for new commercial aircraft has been related to the stability and health of domestic and international economies delays or changes in aircraft and component orders could impact the future demand for our products and have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition while the market for 

20 commercial aircraft has improved since the downturn triggered by the events of september 11th and the war in iraq another such event could increase the level of uncertainty regarding future orders for aircraft 

  in addition we sell products and services to customers in industries that are sensitive to the level of general economic activity and in mature industries that are sensitive to capacity adverse economic conditions affecting these industries may reduce demand for our products and services which may reduce our profits or our production levels or both 

  we develop and manufacture products for customers in the energy exploration market which has been cyclical and suffered from over capacity in prior years strong demand and increased prices for oil and natural gas contributed to substantial revenue growth at teledyne geophysical instruments since 2003 a cyclical downturn in these prices may affect future operating results 

we sell products to customers in industries that may undergo rapid and unpredictable changes 

  we develop and manufacture products for customers in industries that have undergone rapid changes in the past for example we manufacture products and provide manufacturing services to companies that serve telecommunications markets during 2001 many segments of the telecommunications market experienced a dramatic and rapid downturn that resulted in cancellations or deferrals of orders for our products and services this market segment or others that we serve may exhibit rapid changes in the future and may adversely affect our operating results or our production levels or both 

we are subject to the risks associated with international sales 

  during 2005 international sales accounted for approximately 18 of our total revenues compared with 19 in 2004 and 16 in 2003 we anticipate that future international sales will continue to account for a large portion of our revenues risks associated with these sales include 

   any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition exchange rate fluctuations may negatively affect the cost of our products to international customers and therefore reduce our competitive position that is if the us dollar strengthens against the british pound sterling or euro our european customers may no longer find our product prices more attractive than european competitors 

  the september 11th terrorist attacks nuclear proliferation concerns and other factors have resulted in increased export scrutiny of sales of some of our products to international customers travel restrictions to middle eastern and other countries may negatively affect continuing international sales or service revenues from such regions 

compliance with increasing environmental regulations and potential environmental liabilities could have a material adverse financial effect on us 

  we like other industry participants are subject to various federal state local and international environmental laws and regulations we may be subject to increasingly stringent environmental standards in the future future developments administrative actions or liabilities relating to environmental matters could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

21   while the company as part of its overall risk management program has an environmental management and compliance program applicable to its operating facilities including a “review and audit” program to monitor compliance where each facility is reviewed and audited by an internal environmental team every three years such program does not eliminate potential environmental liabilities in addition as the company continues to pursue acquisitions while it conducts environmentalrelated due diligence and generally seeks some form of protection including indemnification from a seller such acquired companies may have environmental liabilities that are not accurately assessed or brought to our attention at the time of the acquisition 

  some of our businesses work with highly dangerous substances that require heightened standards of care for example as a systems contractor for the us army’s program manager for nonstockpile chemical materiel we conduct research development manufacturing test and evaluation and site operations related to the safe and environmentally protective disposal of small caches of chemical munitions and materiel located in over 30 states and territories and binary chemical agents located at pine bluff arsenal arkansas the destruction of chemical weapons is an inherently dangerous activity except for a contained fire during a demonstration testing in an historic program of a process designed to access rockets we have not experienced any accidents or other adverse consequences as a result of our participation in weapon destruction programs we cannot however assure that we will not experience any problems in the future although the federal government provides certain indemnities to contractors in these programs these indemnities may be insufficient to offset liabilities that we may incur in connection with our participation in these programs 

  for additional discussion of environmental matters see the discussion under the caption “other matters — environmental” of “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of results of operation and financial condition” and notes 2 and 15 to notes to consolidated financial statements 

our inability to attract and retain key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our future success 

  our future success depends to a significant extent upon the continued service of our executive officers and other key management and technical personnel and on our ability to continue to attract retain and motivate qualified personnel recruiting and retaining skilled technical personnel has become even more competitive as the domestic economy has improved in recent years while we have engaged in succession planning the loss of the services of one or more of our key employees or our failure to attract retain and motivate qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we may not be able to sell or exit on acceptable terms product lines that we determine no longer meet with our growth strategy 

  consistent with our growth strategy to focus on markets to expand our profitable niche businesses we continually evaluate our product lines to ensure that they are aligned with our strategy for example we determined that the online process control instruments business of the german subsidiary of isco inc was not aligned with our strategy and in march 2005 we sold this nonstrategic business 

  our ability to dispose of product lines that may no longer be aligned with our strategy will depend on many factors including the terms and conditions of any asset purchase and sale agreement as well as industry business and economic conditions we cannot provide any assurance as to when if or on what terms any nonstrategic product lines will be sold also we cannot provide any assurance as to the availability timing terms or conditions of alternative courses of action including closure if the sale of any nonstrategic product line cannot be consummated 

22 provisions of our governing documents applicable law and our change in control severance agreements could make an acquisition of teledyne technologies more difficult 

  our restated certificate of incorporation amended and restated bylaws and rights agreement and the general corporation law of the state of delaware contain several provisions that could make the acquisition of control of teledyne technologies in a transaction not approved by our board of directors more difficult we have also entered into change in control severance agreements with 15 members of our management which could have an antitakeover effect 

the market price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly since our spinoff from ati and could continue to do so 

  since the spinoff on november 29 1999 the market price of our common stock has ranged from a low of 76875 to a high of 3954 per share at february 28 2006 our closing stock price was 3313 fluctuations in our stock price could continue among the factors that could affect our stock price are 

   the stock markets in general and the markets for high technology companies in particular have experienced a high degree of volatility not necessarily related to the operating performance of these companies we cannot provide assurances as to our stock price 

the company’s financial statements are based in part on estimates required by gaap and actual results may differ materially from those estimated under different assumptions or conditions 

  the company’s financial statements are prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states these principles require our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period for example estimates are used when accounting for such items as asset valuations allowances for doubtful accounts depreciation and amortization impairment assessments employee benefits taxes aircraft product and general liability and contingencies while the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances at the time made actual results may differ materially from those estimated 

while the company believes its control systems are effective there are inherent limitations in all control systems and misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected 

  the company continues to take action to assure compliance with the internal controls disclosure controls and other requirements of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 our management including our chief 

23 executive officer and chief financial officer cannot guarantee that our internal controls and disclosure controls will prevent all possible errors or all fraud a control system no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met in addition the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefit of controls must be relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no system of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within the company have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake further controls can be circumvented by individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more persons or by management override of the controls the design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions over time a control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate because of inherent limitations in a costeffective control system misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and may not be detected 

natural disasters such as a serious earthquake in california or a major hurricane in alabama could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

  several of our facilities due to their locations could be subject to a catastrophic loss caused by earthquake or a hurricane many of our production facilities and our headquarters are located in california and thus are in areas with above average seismic activity in addition we have manufacturing facilities in southeastern united states and texas that have been threatened and struck by major hurricanes while teledyne continental motors’ pistonengines manufacturing facility located in mobile alabama and teledyne geophysical instruments’ facility in houston texas were relatively fortunate with respect to the building damage and business interruption they suffered during the severe 2005 hurricane season there can be no assurance that either will be as fortunate in the future if any of our california facilities including our california headquarters were to experience a catastrophic earthquake loss or if any of our alabama tennessee or texas facilities were to experience a catastrophic hurricane storm or tornado such event could disrupt our operations delay production shipments and revenue and result in large expenses to repair or replace the facility or facilities while teledyne has property insurance to partially reimburse it for losses caused by windstorm and earth movement such insurance would not cover all possible losses also our existing disaster recovery plans including those relating to our information technology systems may not be fully responsive to or minimize losses associated with catastrophic events

  the increase in sales for 2004 compared with 2003 resulted from multiyear government contracts which were awarded in 2003 for fuel cell and thermoelectric power generator work operating profit for 2004 compared with the operating loss in 2003 was favorably impacted by the growth in sales and by a reduction of 04 million in research and development costs the operating loss in 2003 included 

38 04 million in charges for contract claims and the recognition of a 05 million loss on a facility sublease agreement segment operating profit included pension expense of 01 million in 2004 compared with no pension expense in 2003 

financial condition liquidity and capital resources 

   our principal capital requirements are to fund working capital needs capital expenditures and debt service requirements as well as to fund acquisitions it is anticipated that operating cash flow together with available borrowings under the credit facility described below will be sufficient to meet these requirements and could be used to fund some acquisitions in the year 2006 to support acquisitions we may need to raise additional capital our liquidity is not dependent upon the use of offbalance sheet financial arrangements we have no offbalance sheet financing arrangements that incorporate the use of special purpose entities or unconsolidated entities 

   the company has a 2800 million credit facility that expires in june 2009 excluding interest and fees no payments are due under the credit facility until the credit facility terminates available borrowing capacity under the 2800 million credit facility which is reduced by borrowings and other financial obligations including outstanding letters of credit was 2202 million at yearend 2005 for a description of some terms of our credit facility see “financing activities” on page 42 

   the following table summarizes our expected cash outflows resulting from financial contracts and commitments at january 1 2006 we have not included information on our normal recurring purchases of materials for use in our operations these amounts are generally consistent from year to year closely reflect our levels of production and are not longterm in nature in millions 

  

   the amounts above exclude our minimum pension plan funding requirements as set forth by erisa which are 188 million in 2006 and 203 million in 2007 our minimum funding requirements after 2005 are dependent on several factors estimates beyond 2007 have not been provided due to the significant uncertainty of these amounts which are subject to change until the company’s sfas no 87 assumptions can be updated at the appropriate times in addition certain pension contributions are eligible for future recovery through the pricing of products and services to the us government under certain government contracts therefore the amounts noted are not necessarily indicative of the impact these contributions may have on the company’s liquidity we also have payments due under our other postretirement benefits plans these plans are not required to be funded in advance but are pay as you go see further discussion in note 12 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

   in 2005 net cash provided from continuing operations was 923 million compared with 849 million in 2004 and 568 million in 2003 

  the higher net cash provided from continuing operations for 2005 compared with 2004 reflected higher net income as well as operating cash flow from acquisitions partially offset by increased working capital requirements 118 million in higher pension contributions and higher compensation payments made in the first quarter of 2005 

  the higher net cash provided from continuing operations for 2004 compared with 2003 reflected improved net income and lower aircraft product liability settlement payments as well as operating cash flow from acquisitions partially offset by defined benefit pension contributions of 31 million the deferred income tax component of the cash flow statement reflected a 68 million increase in 2004 and a 76 million decrease in 2003 related to the minimum pension liability adjustment recorded in each year this adjustment had no impact on cash flows from operations in 2004 or 2003 

   working capital was 1540 million at yearend 2005 compared with 1244 million at yearend 2004 the increase in working capital was primarily due to working capital from recent acquisitions as well as the impact of organic growth we continue to emphasize improvements in working capital management 

   the changes in the following selected components of teledyne balance sheet are discussed below in millions 

   the higher balance in accounts receivables inventory property plant and equipment and accounts payable reflected the impact of businesses acquired in 2005 as well as organic sales growth longterm deferred income taxes reflected a 104 million increase related to the minimum pension liability adjustment in 2005 goodwill and acquired intangible assets reflect the impact of acquisitions the decrease in longterm debt and capital lease obligations resulted from debt payments made from available cash flow offset in part by cash used to acquire businesses in 2005 the accrued pension obligation increased primarily as a result of the increase in the unfunded pension liability in 2005 partially offset by pension contributions the increase in other longterm liabilities reflected an increase in the aircraft product liability reserve an increase in customer deposits and the impact of businesses acquired in 2005 the change in the accumulated other comprehensive loss reflected the 162 million noncash adjustment related to the increase in the unfunded pension liability in 2005 the adjustment to the accumulated other comprehensive loss component of equity was required since the difference between the value of the company’s pension assets and the accumulated pension benefit obligation was larger as of yearend 2005 

40 compared with yearend 2004 the current year reduction to equity did not affect net income and was recorded net of 104 million in deferred taxes 

   net cash used in investing activities included capital expenditures as presented below

  the following is a summary at the acquisition date of the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed for the acquisitions made in 2005 in millions 

 

   cash used in financing activities for 2005 reflected the payment of longterm debt cash provided by financing activities for 2004 reflected net borrowings under the revolving credit agreement cash provided by financing activities for fiscal years 2005 2004 and 2003 reflect proceeds from the exercise of stock options 

  the company has a 2800 million credit facility that expires in june 2009 at yearend 2005 we had 2202 million of available committed credit under the credit facility which can be utilized as needed for daily operating and periodic cash needs including acquisitions borrowings under the credit facility bear interest at our option at a rate based on either a defined base rate or the london interbank offered rate “libor” plus applicable margins the credit agreement also provides for facility fees that vary 

42 between 015 and 030 of the credit line depending on our capitalization ratio as calculated from time to time the credit agreement requires the company to comply with various financial and operating covenants including maintaining certain consolidated leverage and interest coverage ratios as well as minimum net worth levels and limits on acquired debt we also have two 50 million uncommitted credit lines available these credit lines are utilized as needed for periodic cash needs total debt at yearend 2005 includes 390 million outstanding under the 2800 million credit facility 45 million outstanding under one of its 50 million uncommitted bank facilities and 02 million in other debt the company also has a 35 million capital lease of which 01 million is current at yearend 2005 teledyne had 94 million in outstanding letters of credit 

  on january 27 2006 teledyne technologies acquired benthos inc for 1750 per share in cash the aggregate consideration for the outstanding benthos shares was approximately 406 million including payments for the settlement of outstanding stock options or 322 million taking into consideration 84 million in cash acquired teledyne funded the acquisition primarily from borrowings under its 2800 million credit facility 

   in connection with our november 29 1999 spinoff from allegheny teledyne incorporated now known as allegheny technologies incorporated a defined benefit pension plan was established and teledyne assumed the existing pension obligations for all of the employees both active and inactive at the operations which perform government contract work and for active employees at operations which do not perform government contract work ati transferred pension assets to fund the new defined benefit pension plan as of january 1 2004 nonunion new hires participate in an enhanced defined contribution plan as opposed to the company’s existing defined benefit plan currently teledyne anticipates making an aftertax cash contribution of approximately 117 million to its defined benefit pension plan in 2006 before recovery from the us government under one of its spinoff agreements after november 29 2004 the company is able to charge pension costs to the us government under certain government contracts in accordance with cas net after tax pension cash requirements after taking into consideration recovery from the us government is expected to be approximately 61 million in 2006 

  statement of financial accounting standard “sfas” no 87 “employers’ accounting for pensions” requires that a minimum pension liability be recorded if the value of pension assets is less than the accumulated pension benefit obligation this condition existed since yearend 2002 in accordance with the requirements of sfas no 87 the company has a 389 million noncash reduction to stockholders’ equity a longterm intangible asset of 53 million and a longterm additional pension liability of 690 million at yearend 2005 as of yearend 2004 the company had a 227 million noncash reduction to stockholders’ equity a longterm intangible asset of 72 million and a longterm additional pension liability of 443 million the adjustments to equity did not affect net income and are recorded net of deferred taxes the reduction will be reversed should the value of the pension assets exceed the accumulated pension benefit obligation as of a future measurement date see note 12 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional pension disclosures 

other matters 

   the company’s effective tax rate for 2005 was 376 compared with 387 for 2004 and 333 for 2003 the lower effective tax rate for 2005 compared with 2004 primarily reflected the revaluation of deferred tax assets in 2004 due to the impact of state income tax rates total year 2003 reflected an income tax benefit of 24 million due to the reversal of an income tax contingency reserve which was determined to be no longer needed during the third quarter of 2003 excluding this benefit the company’s effective tax rate for 2003 would have been 387 based on the company’s history of operating earnings expectations of future operating earnings and potential tax planning strategies it is more likely than not that the deferred income tax assets at january 1 2006 will be realized 

   inflationary trends in recent years have been moderate we primarily use the lastin firstout method of inventory accounting that reflects current costs in the costs of goods sold these costs the increasing costs of equipment and other costs are considered in establishing sales pricing polices the company emphasizes cost containment in all aspects of its business 

   we have not utilized derivative financial instruments such as futures contracts options and swaps forward foreign exchange contracts or interest rate swaps and futures during 2005 or 2004 we believe that adequate controls are in place to monitor any hedging activities our primary exposure to market risk relates to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates we periodically evaluate these risks and have taken measures to mitigate these risks we own assets and operate facilities in countries that have been politically stable also our foreign risk management objectives are geared towards stabilizing cash flow from the effects of foreign currency fluctuations most of the company’s sales are denominated in us dollars which mitigates the effect of exchange rate changes any borrowings under the company’s revolving credit line are based on a fluctuating market interest rate and consequently the fair value of any outstanding debt should not be affected materially by changes in market interest rates overall we believe that our exposure to interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange rate changes is not material to our financial condition or results of operations 

   in connection with the spinoff teledyne and ati entered into several agreements governing the separation of our businesses and various employee benefits compensation tax indemnification and transition arrangements the company’s principal spinoff requirements including the requirement to ensure a favorable tax treatment have been satisfied one of our directors continues to serve on ati’s board in addition under one of our spinoff agreements the company is able to charge pension costs to the us government under certain government contracts after november 29 2004 in 2004 we purchased the “teledyne” name and related logos symbols and marks from an affiliate of ati for 412000 

  our chairman president and chief executive officer is a director of mellon financial corporation another of our directors is a former chief executive officer and director of mellon financial corporation all transactions with mellon bank na and its affiliates are effected under normal commercial terms and we believe that our relationships with mellon bank na and its affiliates are armslength mellon bank na is one of ten lenders under our 2800 million credit facility having committed up to 250 million under the facility it also provides cash management services and an uncommitted 50 million line of credit mellon bank na serves as trustee under our pension plan and provides asset management services for the plan mellon investor services llc serves as our transfer agent and registrar as well as agent under our stockholders rights plan 

   we are subject to various federal state local and international environmental laws and regulations which require that we investigate and remediate the effects of the release or disposal of materials at sites associated with past and present operations these include sites at which teledyne has been identified as a potentially responsible party under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act commonly known as superfund and comparable state laws we are currently involved in the investigation and remediation of a number of sites reserves for environmental investigation and remediation totaled approximately 35 million at january 1 2006 as investigation and remediation of these sites proceed and new information is received the company expects that accruals will be adjusted to reflect new information based on current information we do not believe that future environmental costs in excess of those already accrued will materially and adversely affect our financial condition or liquidity 

44 however resolution of one or more of these environmental matters or future accrual adjustments in any one reporting period could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations for that period 

  for additional discussion of environmental matters see notes 2 and 15 to the notes to consolidated financial statements 

   we perform work on a number of contracts with the department of defense and other agencies and departments of the us government including subcontracts with government prime contractors sales under these contracts with the us government which included contracts with the department of defense were approximately 42 of total sales in 2005 43 of total sales in 2004 and 46 of total sales in 2003 for a summary of sales to the us government by segment see note 13 to the notes to consolidated financial statements sales to the department of defense represented approximately 32 33 and 31 of total sales for 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively 

  performance under government contracts has certain inherent risks that could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business results of operations and financial condition government contracts are conditioned upon the continuing availability of congressional appropriations which usually occurs on a fiscal year basis even though contract performance may take more than one year while us defense spending increased as a result of the september 11th terrorist attacks and the war in iraq it is currently expected to moderate over the next few years notwithstanding the recent increase in u s defense spending delays or declines in us military expenditures in the programs in which we participate could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

  for information on accounts receivable from the us government see note 5 to the notes to consolidated financial statements 

   our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent liabilities on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including those related to product returns allowance for doubtful accounts inventories intangible assets income taxes warranty obligations pension and other postretirement benefits longterm contracts environmental workers’ compensation and general liability aircraft product liability employee dental and medical benefits and other contingencies and litigation we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances at the time the results of which form the basis for making our judgments actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions in some cases such differences may be material see “other matters — critical accounting policies” 

45   the following table reflects significant reserves and valuation accounts which are estimates and based on judgments as described above at january 1 2006 and january 2 2005 

reserves and valuation accountsa 

  

   some of the company’s products are subject to specified warranties and the company provides for the estimated cost of product warranties we regularly assess the adequacy of our preexisting warranty liabilities and adjust amounts as necessary based on a review of historic warranty experience with respect to the applicable business or products as well as the length and actual terms of the warranties which are typically one year the product warranty reserve is included in current accrued liabilities on the balance sheet changes in the company’s product warranty reserve are as follows in millions 

 

   the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with united states generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the notes to the financial statements some of those judgments can be subjective and complex and therefore actual results could differ materially from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions our critical accounting policies are those that are reflective of significant judgment complexity and uncertainty and may potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions we have identified the following as critical accounting policies contract revenue recognition and contract estimates aircraft product liability reserve accounting for pension plans and accounting for business combinations goodwill and longlived assets for additional discussion of the application of these and other accounting policies see note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

   commercial sales and sales from us government fixedpricetype contracts are generally recorded as shipments are made or as services are rendered occasionally for certain us government fixedprice type contracts that require substantial performance over a long time period one or more years before shipments begin in accordance with the requirements of american institute of certified public 

46 accountants statement of position 811 “accounting for performance of constructiontype and certain productiontype contracts” revenues may be recorded based upon attainment of scheduled performance milestones which could be time event or expense driven in these few instances invoices are submitted to the customer under a contractual agreement and payments are made by the customer sales under costreimbursement contracts usually from the us government are recorded as allowable costs are incurred and fees are earned 

  the development of cost of sales percentages used to record costs under certain fixedprice type contracts and fees under certain costreimbursement type contracts requires that the company make reasonably dependable cost estimates for the design manufacture and delivery of products and services sometimes over a long time period since certain fixedprice and costreimbursement type contracts extend over a long period of time the impact of revisions in cost and funding estimates during the progress of work may adjust the current period earnings on a cumulative catchup basis if the current contract estimate indicates a loss a provision is made for the total anticipated loss in the period that it becomes evident these types of contracts and estimates are most frequently related to our sales to the us government for our sales to the us government in 2005 2004 and 2003 operating income as a percent of sales did not vary by more than 13 if operating income as a percent of sales to the us government had been higher or lower by 13 in 2005 the company’s operating income would have changed by approximately 80 million 

   we are currently involved in certain legal proceedings related to aircraft product liability claims we have accrued an estimate for the probable costs for the resolution of these claims this estimate has been developed in consultation with our insurers outside counsel handling our defense in these matters and historical experience and is based upon an analysis of potential results assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies we do not believe these proceedings will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position it is possible however that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by specific events occurring in the period changes in our assumptions or the effectiveness of our strategies related to these proceedings the company has aircraft and product liability insurance however based on a review of claims experience changes to the claims management process and an analysis of available options the company in 2004 increased its annual selfinsurance retention for general aviation aircraft liabilities incurred in connection with products manufactured by teledyne continental motors to 250 million from 150 million and as a result lowered its annual insurance premium if a significant liability claim or combination of claims were identified even taking into account insurance coverage operating profit in a given period could be reduced significantly accruals could be made in a given period for amounts up to our annual selfinsurance retention based on the facts and circumstances of the claims we have not always accrued amounts up to our annual selfinsurance retention also we cannot assure that for 2006 and in future years our ability to obtain insurance or the premiums for such insurance or the amount of our selfinsured retention or reserves will not be negatively impacted by our experience in prior years or other factors our current aircraft product liability insurance policy expires in may 2006 

   teledyne has a defined benefit pension plan covering most of its employees the company accounts for its defined benefit pension plan in accordance with sfas no 87 “employers’ accounting for pensions” which requires that amounts recognized in financial statements be determined on an actuarial basis rather than as contributions are made to the plan a significant element in determining the company’s pension income or expense in accordance with sfas no 87 is the expected return on plan assets the company has assumed based upon the types of securities the plan assets are invested in and the longterm historical returns of these investments that the longterm expected return on pension assets will be 85 in 2006 compared with 85 in 2005 and its assumed discount rate will be 600 in 2006 compared with 625 in 2005 the actual rate of return on pension assets was 51 in 2005 and 98 in 

47 2004 if the actual rate of return on pension assets is above the projection the company may be able to reduce its contributions to the pension trust if the actual rate of return on pension assets is below the projection the company may be required to make additional contributions to the pension trust the company made an aftertax contribution of 92 million to its pension plan in 2005 and currently anticipates making an aftertax cash contribution of approximately 117 million to its defined benefit pension plan in 2006 before recovery from the us government the assumed longterm rate of return on assets is applied to the marketrelated value of plan assets at the end of the previous year this produces the expected return on plan assets that is included in annual pension income or expense for the current year the cumulative difference between this expected return and the actual return on plan assets is deferred and amortized into pension income or expense over future periods since the value of the company’s pension assets were less than the accumulated pension benefit obligation in accordance with the requirements of sfas no 87 the company has a 389 million noncash reduction to stockholders’ equity a longterm intangible asset of 53 million and a longterm additional pension liability of 690 million at yearend 2005 the adjustment to equity did not affect net income and is net of deferred taxes of 248 million the charge will be reversed should the value of the pension assets exceed the accumulated pension benefit obligation as of a future measurement date 

  differences in the discount rate and expected longterm rate of return on assets within the indicated range would have had the following impact on 2005 results 

   see note 12 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional pension disclosures 

   the company accounts for goodwill and purchased intangible assets under sfas no 141 “business combinations” and sfas no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” in all acquisitions the results are included in the company’s consolidated financial statements from the date of each respective acquisition business acquisitions are accounted for under the purchase method by assigning the purchase price to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at their fair values and the excess of the purchase price over the amounts assigned is recorded as goodwill purchased intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives 

  goodwill and acquired intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized we review goodwill and acquired indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable the company also performs an annual impairment test in the fourth quarter of each year based on the annual impairment test completed in the fourth quarter of 2005 no impairment of goodwill or intangible assets with indefinite lives was indicated the company estimates the fair value of the reporting units which are our four business segments using a discounted cash flow model based on our best estimate of amounts and timing of future revenues and cash flows and our most recent business and strategic plans and compares the estimated fair value to the net book value of the reporting unit including goodwill the development of future revenues and cash flows projections for our business and strategic plan and the annual impairment test involve significant judgments changes in these projections could affect the estimated fair value of certain of the company’s reporting units and could result in a goodwill impairment charge in a future period however a 10 percent decrease in the current fair value estimate of each of the company’s reporting units would not result in a goodwill impairment charge 

48   we monitor the recoverability of the carrying value of our longlived assets an impairment charge is recognized when events and circumstances indicate that the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by an asset including any proceeds from dispositions are less than the carrying value of the asset and the asset’s carrying value is less than its fair value our cash flow estimates are based on historical results adjusted to reflect our best estimate of future market and operating conditions the net carrying value of assets not recoverable is reduced to fair value our estimates of fair value represent our best estimate based on industry trends and reference to market rates and transactions our determination of what constitutes an indication of possible impairment the estimation of future cash flows and the determination of estimated fair value are all significant judgments 

 

   in december 2004 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued sfas no 123r “share based payment” “sfas no 123r” that will require compensation costs related to sharebased payment transactions to be recognized in the financial statements with limited exceptions the amount of compensation costs will be measured based on the grant datefair value of the equity or liability instrument issued compensation cost will be recognized over the period that an employee provides service in exchange for the award sfas no 123r replaces sfas no 123 “accounting for stockbased compensation” and supersedes apb opinion no 25 “accounting for stock issued to employees” the company adopted sfas no 123r in the first quarter of 2006 the adoption of sfas no 123r is expected to reduce pretax earnings by approximately 54 million in 2006 based on current assumptions 

   in november 2004 the fasb issued sfas no 151 “inventory costsan amendment of arb no 43 chapter 4” “sfas no 151” sfas no 151 amends the guidance in arb no 43 chapter 4 “inventory pricing” to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense freight handling costs and wasted material spoilage sfas no 151 requires that those items be recognized as currentperiod charges sfas no 151 is effective for first fiscal years beginning after june 15 2005 the adoption of sfas no 151 is not expected to have any impact on the company 

outlook 

  based on its current outlook the company’s management believes that first quarter 2006 earnings per share will be in the range of approximately 043 to 046 the full year 2006 earnings per share outlook is expected to be in the range of approximately 185 to 190 our estimated effective income tax rate for 2006 is 376 

  our 2006 outlook reflects anticipated sales growth in its defense electronics and instrumentation businesses due primarily to the contribution of our acquisitions completed in 2005 and the benthos acquisition completed in january 2006 we have not included future acquisitions if any in the 2006 outlook 

  the full year 2006 earnings outlook includes approximately 164 million 028 per share in pension expense under sfas no 87 or 66 million 011 per share in net pension expense after recovery of allowable pension costs from our cas covered government contracts full year 2005 earnings included 127 million 023 per share in pension expense under sfas no 87 or 34 million 006 per share in net pension expense after recovery of allowable pension costs from our cas covered government contracts the increase in full year 2006 pension expense reflects in part the reduction of the discount rate assumption for the company’s defined benefit plan from 625 in 2005 to 600 in 2006 our 2006 earnings outlook also reflects 54 million 010 per share in stock option compensation expense based on current assumptions regarding stock option issuances during the year and estimated fair value of the stock option grants in december 2004 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued statement of financial accounting standard “sfas” no 123r “share based payment”

 13   dr mehrabian has an amended and restated employment agreement with teledyne which provides that we will employ him as the chairman president and chief executive officer the agreement terminates on december 31 of each year but will be extended annually unless either party gives the other written notice prior to october 31 of the year of such term that it will not be extended starting september 1 2004 dr mehrabian’s annual base salary was 631350 the agreement provides that dr mehrabian is entitled to participate in teledyne’s annual incentive bonus plan and other executive compensation and benefit programs the agreement provides dr mehrabian with a nonqualified pension arrangement under which teledyne will pay him following his retirement as payments supplemental to any accrued pension under our qualified pension plan an amount equal to 50 of his base compensation as in effect at retirement the number of years for which such annual amount shall be paid will be equal to the number of years of his service to teledyne including service to ati but not more than 10 years 

  fifteen current members of management have entered into change in control severance agreements with teledyne the agreements have a threeyear automatically renewing term under the agreements the executive is entitled to severance benefits if 1 there is a change in control of teledyne and 2 within three months before or 24 months after the change in control either we terminate the executive’s employment for reasons other than for cause or the executive terminates employment for good reason “severance benefits” consist of 

 14 risk factors cautionary statement as to forwardlooking statements 

  the following text highlights various risks and uncertainties associated with teledyne these factors could materially affect “forwardlooking statements” within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 that we may from time to time make including forwardlooking statements contained in “item 1 business” and “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” of this form 10k and in teledyne’s 2004 annual report to stockholders 

our dependence on revenue from government contracts subjects us to many risks including the risk that we may not be successful in bidding for future contracts and the risk that us government funding for our existing contracts may be diverted to other uses or delayed 

  we perform work on a number of contracts with the department of defense and other agencies and departments of the us government including subcontracts with government prime contractors sales under contracts with the us government as a whole including sales under contracts with the department of defense as prime contractor or subcontractor represented approximately 43 of our total revenue for 2004 performance under government contracts has certain inherent risks that could have a material effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

  government contracts are conditioned upon the continuing availability of congressional appropriations congress typically appropriates funds for a given program on a fiscalyear basis even though contract performance may take more than one year as a result at the beginning of a major program a contract is typically only partially funded and additional monies are normally committed to the contract by the procuring agency only as congress makes appropriations available for future fiscal years 

  while us defense spending has increased as a result of the september 11th terrorist attacks and the war in iraq it is currently expected to moderate over the next few years continued defense spending does not necessarily correlate to continued business for the company because not all the programs in which teledyne participates or has current capabilities may be provided with continued funding each of the middle east and the north korean situations could result in a diversion of funds from programs in which teledyne participates and redirection of those funds to pay for costs associated with either situation or programs more closely related to it 

  our electronics and communications segment provides a variety of products for newer military platforms such as the fa22 and f35 aircraft development and production of these aircrafts are very expensive and there is no guarantee that the department of defense as it balances priorities will continue to provide funding to manufacture and support these platforms 

  also over time programs can evolve and affect the extent of our participation for example one of teledyne brown engineering’s programs was restructured in 2003 to change the emphasis from a focus on test and evaluation to a focus on deployment and sustainment which resulted in a nearly 16 decline in revenues from this contract compared to 2002 from 58 million to 49 million then in 2004 revenues related to this program totaled approximately 54 million with the increase over 2003 resulting from unanticipated ground tests the company expects revenues from this program to decline in 2005 

  the company principally and traditionally through its systems engineering solutions segment has been a significant contributor to nasa programs the centerpiece of our current nasa activities is the international space station while the company anticipates contributing to president bush’s announced vision for nasa that includes lunar and interplanetary exploration funding for this vision may be reduced in the near term due to additional funding needs to return the space shuttle to flight 

  furthermore we obtain many us government prime contracts and subcontracts through the process of competitive bidding we may not be successful in having our bids accepted 

  until november 29 2004 under one of our spinoff agreements we were not able to charge pension costs to the us government under our various government contracts since such date we are able to so 

15 charge pension costs while this might help reduce our pension expense the addition of such costs in a bid for us government contracts which is in essence an increase to the contract price to be paid may itself negatively affect an award decision being made in favor of the company 

  most of our us government contracts are subject to termination by the us government either at its convenience or upon the default of the contractor terminationforconvenience provisions provide only for the recovery of costs incurred or committed settlement expenses and profit on work completed prior to termination terminationfordefault clauses impose liability on the contractor for excess costs incurred by the us government in reprocuring undelivered items from another source 

  there is no guarantee that us government contracts will be profitable a number of our us government prime contracts and subcontracts are fixed pricetype contracts 43 in 2004 as compared to 44 in 2003 and 41 in 2002 under these types of contracts we bear the inherent risk that actual performance cost may exceed the fixed contract price this is particularly true where the contract was awarded and the price finalized in advance of final completion of design we continue to believe that the us government is increasingly requesting proposals for fixed pricetype contracts 

  certain fees under some of our us government contracts are linked to meeting development or testing deadlines fees may also be influenced or dependent on the collective efforts and success of other defense contractors over which we had no or limited control 

  we like other government contractors are subject to various audits reviews and investigations including private party “whistleblower” lawsuits relating to our compliance with federal and state laws in addition we have a compliance program designed to surface issues that may lead to voluntary disclosures to the us government generally claims arising out of these us government inquiries and voluntary disclosures can be resolved without resorting to litigation however should the business unit or division involved be charged with wrongdoing or should the us government determine that the unit or division is not a “presently responsible contractor” that unit or division and conceivably our company as a whole could be temporarily suspended or in the event of a conviction could be debarred for up to three years from receiving new government contracts or governmentapproved subcontracts in addition we could expend substantial amounts in defending against such charges and in damages fines and penalties if such charges are proven or result in negotiated settlements in october 2002 the company was informed that the us government had declined to intervene in a lawsuit filed under seal pursuant to the false claims act more than four years before the company believes that its electronic safety products unit’s involvement in the civil action is over as the plaintiff’s appeal of company’s motion to dismiss this action has been denied and the plaintiff’s petition for a rehearing en banc by the court of appeals of the dc circuit has also been denied should the plaintiff file a petition for certiorari with the united states supreme court by march 21 2005 the company intends to continue its vigorous defense 

a declining stock market and lower interests rates negatively affect the value of our pension assets and could have a material adverse financial effect on us 

  we have a defined benefit pension plan covering most of our employees at yearend 2004 notwithstanding improved market conditions because of significant declines in the stock market over the last few years and low interest rates the value of the pension assets was less than our accumulated pension benefit obligation the accounting rules applicable to our pension plan require that amounts recognized in financial statements to be determined on an actuarial basis rather than as contributions are made to the plan two significant elements in determining our pension income or pension expense are the expected return on plan assets and the discount rate used in projecting pension benefit obligations we have assumed based on the type of securities in which the plan assets are invested and the longterm historical returns of these investments that the longterm expected return on pension assets will continue to be 85 in 2005 as it was in 2004 and 2003 and the assumed discount rate will be 625 in 2005 compared to 65 in 2004 and 70 in 2003 

  since the spinoff through 2002 we recorded pension income in 2003 we began to incur pension expense and we expect to continue to incur pension expense the decline in pension income and the start 

16 of pension expense in 2003 is due to the completion in 2001 of income amortization associated with the transition assets recorded pursuant to statement of financial accounting standards no 87 — “employee’s accounting for pensions” as well as the decline in the value of our pension assets coupled with reductions in our expected rate of return and discount rate assumptions used for pension plan calculations as described above we currently expect net pension expense of approximately 60 million in 2005 compared to net pension expense of 82 million in 2004 and 69 million for 2003 the expected reduced pension expense in 2005 relates to the termination on november 29 2004 of one of our spinoff requirements that prohibited us from charging pension costs to the us government under various government contracts until such date given our pension plan’s current underfunded status in 2004 we began making required cash contributions to our pension plan declines in the stock market and lower rates of return could increase future years required contributions to our pension plan 

  effective january 1 2004 in an effort to help alleviate additional pension expense in future years new nonunion employee hires do not participate in the defined benefit pension plan but participate in an enhanced teledyne technologies incorporated 401k plan 

united states’ and global responses to terrorism the middle east situation and perceived nuclear threats increase uncertainties with respect to many of our businesses and may adversely affect the company’s business and results of operations 

  united states’ and global responses to terrorism the middle east situation and perceived nuclear threats from north korea and others increase uncertainties with respect to us and other business and financial markets several factors associated directly or indirectly with terrorism the iraq situation and perceived nuclear threats and responses may adversely affect the company 

  while some of our businesses that provide products or services to the us government experienced greater demand for their products and services as a result of increased us government defense spending various responses could realign government programs and affect the composition funding or timing of our government programs government spending could shift to defense or homeland security programs in which we may not participate or may not have current capabilities and curtail less pressing nondefense programs in which we do participate including department of energy or nasa programs 

  the effect of the decline in air travel on the financial condition of many of our commercial airline and aircraft manufacturer customers resulting from terrorism another sars scare and other factors could adversely affect our electronics and communications segment 

  deterioration of financial performance of airlines could result in a further reduction of discretionary spending for upgrades of avionics and inflight communications equipment which would adversely affect our electronics and communications segment 

  the government continues to evaluate potential security issues associated with general aviation increased government regulations including but not limited to increased airspace regulations could lead to an overall decline in air travel and have an adverse affect on our aerospace engines and components segment as happened after the september 11th terrorist attacks reinstatement of flight restrictions would negatively impact the market for general aviation aircraft piston engines and components and would also adversely affect our aerospace engines and components segment potential reductions in the need for general aviation aircraft maintenance due to declines in air travel could also adversely affect our aerospace engines and components segment 

acquisitions involve inherent risks that may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

  our growth strategy includes acquisitions acquisitions involve various inherent risks such as 

 17 

   while the company conducts financial and other due diligence in connection with its acquisitions and generally seeks some form of protection including indemnification from a seller and sometimes an escrow of a portion of the purchase price to cover potential issues such acquired companies may have weaknesses or liabilities that are not accurately assessed or brought to our attention at the time of the acquisition further such indemnities or escrows may not fully cover such matters in july 2004 we acquired reynolds industries incorporated a private company that did not have formal internal controls and compliance systems in place while the company required the sellers to take certain compliance actions prior to the closing of the acquisition including with respect to export controls there is no assurance that we identified all issues 

  in june 2004 we acquired isco inc while this company’s products and customer base are complementary to teledyne’s existing instrumentation businesses there is no assurance that we will achieve all identified financial operating and distribution synergies 

  in connection with acquisitions we may consolidate one or more acquired facilities with other teledyne facilities to obtain synergies and costsavings for example we have recently relocated the manufacturing operations of the acquired defense electronics assets of celeritek inc to our mountain view california facility despite planning relocation of manufacturing operations has inherent risks as it tends to involve among other things change of personnel and learning or adaptation of manufacturing processes and techniques production delays at the new operating location could result 

  except for the filtronic solid state assets acquisition as permitted by sec rules our management’s report as to our assessment of the effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting excludes our 2004 acquisitions from its scope and coverage we plan to evaluate the internal controls of these acquired companies in 2005 and implement a formal and rigorous system of internal controls the company can provide no assurance that we will be able to provide a report that contains no significant deficiencies or material weaknesses with respect to these acquired companies or other acquisitions 

we may not have sufficient resources to fund all future research and development and capital expenditures or possible acquisitions 

  in order to remain competitive we must make substantial investments in research and development to develop new and enhanced products and continuously upgrade our process technology and manufacturing capabilities 

  although we believe that anticipated cash flows from operations and available borrowings under our 2800 million credit facility will be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated working capital research and development and capital investment needs we may be unable to fund all of these needs or possible acquisitions our ability to raise additional capital will depend on a variety of factors some of which will not be within our control including resurgence of the public offering market investor perceptions of us our businesses and the industries in which we operate and general economic conditions we may be unable to successfully raise additional capital if needed failure to successfully raise needed capital on a timely or costeffective basis could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

we may be unsuccessful in our efforts to increase our participation in certain new markets 

  we intend to both adapt our existing technology and develop new products to expand into new market segments for example we are developing new fuel cell related technologies the market for fuel cell 

18 technologies is not well established and there are a number of companies that have announced intentions to develop and market fuel cell products some of these companies have greater financial andor technological resources than we do 

  we are also developing new electronic products including electronic flight bags and highdensity microprocessor connectors which are intended to access markets in which teledyne does not currently participate or has limited participation we may be unsuccessful in accessing these markets if our products do not meet our customers’ requirements due to either changes in technology and industry standards or because of actions taken by our competitors 

we may be unable to successfully introduce new and enhanced products in a timely and costeffective manner 

  our operating results depend in part on our ability to introduce new and enhanced products on a timely basis successful product development and introduction depend on numerous factors including our ability to anticipate customer and market requirements changes in technology and industry standards our ability to differentiate our offerings from offerings of our competitors and market acceptance 

  we may not be able to develop and introduce new or enhanced products in a timely and costeffective manner or to develop and introduce products that satisfy customer requirements our new products also may not achieve market acceptance or correctly anticipate new industry standards and technological changes 

technological change and evolving industry standards could cause certain of our products or services to become obsolete or noncompetitive 

  the markets for a number of our products and services are generally characterized by rapid technological development evolving industry standards changes in customer requirements and new product introductions and enhancements a faster than anticipated change in one or more of the technologies related to our products or services or in market demand for products or services based on a particular technology could result in faster than anticipated obsolescence of certain of our products or services and could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operation and financial condition currently accepted industry standards are also subject to change which may contribute to the obsolescence of our products or services 

  the company is currently working to make sure that certain of its electronic products sold in european member states comply with a directive not to contain impermissible levels of lead mercury cadmium hexavalent chromium polybrominated biphenyls or polybrominated diphenyl ethers on or after july 1 2006 although many of our products are exempt from the european directive we expect that over time component manufacturers may discontinue selling components that have the restricted substances this will in turn require teledyne to accommodate changes in parameters such as the way parts are soldered and may in some cases require redesign of certain products 

product liability claims or recalls could have a material adverse effect on our reputation business results of operations and financial condition 

  as a manufacturer and distributor of various products our results of operations are susceptible to adverse publicity regarding the quality or safety of our products in part product liability claims challenging the safety of our products may result in a decline in sales for a particular product which could adversely affect our results of operations this could be the case even if the claims themselves are proven untrue or settled for immaterial amounts 

  while we have general liability and other insurance policies concerning product liabilities we have selfinsured retentions or deductibles under such policies with respect to a portion of these liabilities for example our current annual selfinsured retention for general aviation aircraft liabilities incurred in 

19 connection with products manufactured by teledyne continental motors inc is 250 million our existing aircraft product liability insurance policy expires in may 2005 

  product recalls and field service actions could also have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition for example teledyne continental motors had been engaged in a product recall of piston engine crankshafts whereby the company recorded a 120 million pretax charge in the second quarter of 2000 product recalls have the potential for tarnishing a company’s reputation and could have a material adverse effect on the sales of our products in 2002 we reached a monetary settlement related to the 2000 recall with two of three companies that manufactured and processed allegedly defective steel subsequently made into aircraft engine crankshafts we failed to win a jury verdict against a third company involved in making the steel the company continues to pursue cost recovery through litigation against one other materials supplier as a result of the 2000 product recall program there is no assurance that the company will recover any costs or the negative impact on its reputation 

  the company has been joined among a number of defendants often over 100 in lawsuits alleging injury or death as a result of exposure to asbestos we have not incurred material liabilities in connection with these lawsuits the filings typically do not identify any of the company’s products as a source of asbestos exposure and the company has been dismissed from cases for lack of product identification but only after some defense costs have been incurred also because of the prominent “teledyne” name we may be mistakenly joined in lawsuits involving a company or business that was not spun off or otherwise assumed by us as part of our 1999 spinoff the company’s historic insurance coverage including that of its predecessors may not fully cover such claims and defense of such matters as coverage depends on the year of purported exposure and other factors nonetheless the company intends to defend these claims vigorously congress has been considering tort reform to deal with asbestosrelated claims and has recently passed legislation addressing class action lawsuits 

  the gas generators manufactured by teledyne energy systems inc currently contain a sealed wetted asbestos component while the company has begun transitioning to a replacement material has placed warning labels on its products and takes care in handling of this material by employees there is no assurance that the company will not face product liability claims involving this component 

  our teledyne brown engineering’s laboratory in knoxville tennessee performs radiological analyses while the laboratory is certified by the department of energy has other nuclearrelated certifications and has internal quality controls in place errors and omissions in analyses may occur we currently have errors and omissions insurance coverage and nuclear liability insurance coverage that might apply depending on the circumstances we also have sought indemnities from some of our customers our insurance coverage or indemnities however may not be adequate to cover potential problems associated with faulty radiological analyses 

  we cannot assure that we will not have additional product liability claims or that we will not recall any additional products 

we may have difficulty obtaining product liability and other insurance coverages or be subject to increased costs for such coverage 

  insurance costs have increased greatly over the last few years as a manufacturer of a variety of products including aircraft engines used in general aviation aircraft we have general liability and other insurance policies that provide coverage beyond selfinsured retentions or deductibles we cannot assure that for 2005 and in future years insurance carriers will be willing to renew coverage or provide new coverage for product liability especially as it relates to general aviation if such insurance is available we may be required to pay substantially higher prices for coverage andor increase our levels of selfinsured retentions or reserves the company’s current aircraft product liability insurance policy expires in may 2005 in connection with the last renewal based on more recent favorable claims experience and changes to the claims management process the company lowered its insurance premium costs and increased its annual selfinsured retention to 250 million from 150 million to alleviate aircraft product liability 

20 insurance costs the company continues to try to reduce manufacturing and other costs and also to pass on such insurance costs through price increases on its aircraft engines and spare parts the company cannot provide assurances that further cost reduction efforts will prove successful or that customers will accept additional price increases 

  for certain electronic components for medical applications that we manufacture such as those that go into cochlear implants we have asked for indemnities from our customers andor to be included under their insurance policies we cannot however provide any assurance that such indemnities or insurance will offset potential liabilities that we may incur as a result of our manufacture of such components 

  aside from the uncertainties created by external events such as september 11th and subsequent activities our ability to obtain product liability insurance and the cost for such insurance are affected by our historical claims experience we cannot assure that for 2005 and in future years our ability to obtain insurance or the cost for such insurance or the amount of selfinsured retentions or reserves will not be negatively impacted by our experience in prior years 

increasing competition could reduce the demand for our products and services 

  although we believe that we have certain advantages that help us compete in our markets each of our markets is highly competitive many of our competitors have and potential competitors could have greater name recognition a larger installed base of products more extensive engineering manufacturing marketing and distribution capabilities and greater financial technological and personnel resources than we do new or existing competitors may also develop new technologies that could adversely affect the demand for our products and services industry consolidation trends particularly among aerospace and defense contractors could adversely affect demand for our products and services if prime contractors seek to control more aspects of vertically integrated projects 

we sell products and services to customers in industries that are cyclical and sensitive to changes in general economic activity 

  we derive significant revenues from the commercial aerospace industry domestic and international commercial aerospace markets are cyclical in nature historic demand for new commercial aircraft has been related to the stability and health of domestic and international economies delays or changes in aircraft and component orders could impact the future demand for our products and have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition while the market for commercial aircraft has improved since the downturn triggered by the events of september 11th and the iraqi war another such event would increase the level of uncertainty regarding future orders for aircraft 

  in addition we sell products and services to customers in industries that are sensitive to the level of general economic activity and in mature industries that are sensitive to capacity adverse economic conditions affecting these industries may reduce demand for our products and services which may reduce our profits or our production levels or both 

  we develop and manufacture products for customers in the energy exploration market which has been cyclical and suffered from over capacity in prior years strong demand and increased prices for oil and natural gas contributed to substantial revenue growth during 2004 at teledyne geophysical instruments which is not expected to be sustained 

we sell products to customers in industries that may undergo rapid and unpredictable changes 

  we develop and manufacture products for customers in industries that have undergone rapid changes in the past for example we manufacture products and provide manufacturing services to companies that serve telecommunications markets during 2001 many segments of the telecommunications market experienced a dramatic and rapid downturn that resulted in cancellations or deferrals of orders for our products and services this market segment or others that we serve may exhibit rapid changes in the future and may adversely affect our operating results or our production levels or both 

21 we are subject to the risks associated with international sales 

  during 2004 international sales accounted for approximately 19 of our total revenues we anticipate that future international sales will continue to account for a significant percentage of our revenues risks associated with these sales include 

   any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition exchange rate fluctuations may negatively affect the cost of our products to international customers and therefore reduce our competitive position given the current exchange rate between the us dollar and the british pound sterling european contracts for which we are paid in us dollars could be negatively affected to the extent the underlying costs to the company to fulfill the contract are paid in pounds sterling in prior years weak conditions in asian economies have affected our results of operations adversely the september 11th terrorist attacks as well as fears of an international arms race have resulted in increased export scrutiny of sales of some of our products to international customers travel restrictions to middle eastern and other countries may negatively affect continuing international sales or service revenues from such regions 

compliance with increasing environmental regulations and the effects of potential environmental liabilities could have a material adverse financial effect on us 

  we like other industry participants are subject to various federal state local and international environmental laws and regulations we may be subject to increasingly stringent environmental standards in the future future developments administrative actions or liabilities relating to environmental matters could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

  while the company has an environmental management system and compliance program applicable to its operating facilities including a “review and audit” program to monitor compliance where each facility is reviewed and audited by an internal environmental team every three years such internal control is designed to reduce environment risk it does not eliminate potential environmental liabilities in addition as the company continues to pursue acquisitions while it conducts environmentalrelated due diligence and generally seeks some form of protection including indemnification from a seller such acquired companies may have environmental liabilities that are not accurately assessed or brought to our attention at the time of the acquisition 

  some of our businesses work with highly dangerous substances that require heightened standards of care for example as a systems contractor for the us army’s program manager for nonstockpile chemical materiel we conduct research development manufacturing test and evaluation and site operations related to the safe and environmentally protective disposal of small caches of chemical munitions and materiel located in over 30 states and territories the destruction of chemical weapons is an inherently dangerous activity except for a contained fire during a demonstration testing of a process designed to access rockets in a former program we have not experienced any accidents or other adverse consequences as a result of our participation in weapon destruction programs we cannot however assure that we will not experience any problems in the future although the federal government provides certain 

22 indemnities to contractors in these programs these indemnities may be insufficient to offset liabilities that we may incur in connection with our participation in these programs 

  for additional discussion of environmental matters see the discussion under the caption “other matters — environmental” of “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition” and notes 2 and 16 to notes to consolidated financial statements 

our inability to attract and retain key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our future success 

  our future success depends to a significant extent upon the continued service of our executive officers and other key management and technical personnel and on our ability to continue to attract retain and motivate qualified personnel recruiting and retaining skilled technical personnel is highly competitive the loss of the services of one or more of our key employees or our failure to attract retain and motivate qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we may not be able to sell or exit on acceptable terms product lines that we determine no longer meet with our growth strategy 

  consistent with our growth strategy to focus on markets to expand our profitable niche businesses we continually evaluate our product lines to ensure that they are aligned with our strategy for example we determined that the online process control instruments business of the german subsidiary of isco inc was not aligned with our strategy and in february 2005 we entered into an agreement to sell this nonstrategic business 

  our ability to dispose of product lines that may no longer be aligned with our strategy will depend on many factors including the terms and conditions of any asset purchase and sale agreement as well as industry business and economic conditions we cannot provide any assurance as to when if or on what terms any nonstrategic product lines will be sold also we cannot provide any assurance as to the availability timing terms or conditions of alternative courses of action including closure or the sale of any nonstrategic product line cannot be consummated 

provisions of our governing documents applicable law and our change in control severance agreements could make an acquisition of teledyne more difficult 

  our restated certificate of incorporation amended and restated bylaws and rights agreement and the general corporation law of the state of delaware contain several provisions that could make the acquisition of control of teledyne in a transaction not approved by our board of directors more difficult we have also entered into change in control severance agreements with 15 members of our management which could have an antitakeover effect 

the market price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly since our spinoff from ati and could continue to do so 

  since the spinoff on november 29 1999 the market price of our common stock has ranged from a low of 76875 to a high of 3197 per share at february 28 2005 our closing stock price was 3058 fluctuations in our stock price could continue among the factors that could affect our stock price are 

 23 

   the stock markets in general and the markets for high technology companies in particular have experienced a high degree of volatility not necessarily related to the operating performance of particular companies we cannot provide assurances as to our stock price 

while the company believes its control systems are effective there are inherent limitations in all control systems and misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected 

  the company continues to take action to assure compliance with the internal controls disclosure controls and other requirements of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer cannot guarantee that our internal controls and disclosure controls will prevent all possible errors or all fraud a control system no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met in addition the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefit of controls must be relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no system of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within the company have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake further controls can be circumvented by individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more persons or by management override of the controls the design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions over time a control may be inadequate because of changes in conditions or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate because of inherent limitations in a costeffective control system misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected 

a serious earthquake in california could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

  several of our facilities could be subject to a catastrophic loss caused by earthquake due to their locations many of our production facilities and our headquarters are located in california and thus are in areas with above average seismic activity if any of these facilities or our california headquarters were to experience a catastrophic earthquake loss and notwithstanding our disaster recovery plans including relating to information technology systems it could disrupt our operations delay production shipments and revenue and result in large expenses to repair or replace the facility or facilities 










 item 2 properties 

  our principal facilities as of january 2 2005 are listed below although the facilities vary in terms of age and condition our management believes that these facilities have generally been well maintained and are adequate for current operations 

 25    we also own or lease facilities elsewhere in the united states and outside the united states including facilities in tijuana mexico gloucester newbury and west drayton england cumbernauld scotland cwmbran wales and ottawa canada our corporate executive offices are located at 12333 west olympic boulevard los angeles california 900641021 




 item 3 legal proceedings 

  from time to time we become involved in various lawsuits claims and proceedings related to the conduct of our business including those pertaining to product liability patent infringement commercial employment and employee benefits while we cannot predict the outcome of any lawsuit claim or proceeding our management does not believe that the disposition of any pending matters is likely to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or liquidity the resolution in any reporting period of one or more of these matters however could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations for that period 




 item 4 submission of matters to a vote of security holders 

  no matters were submitted to a vote of teledyne’s stockholders during the fourth quarter of 2004

price range of common stock and dividend policy 

  our common stock is listed on the new york stock exchange and traded under the symbol “tdy” the following table sets forth for the periods indicated the high and low sale prices for the common stock as reported by the new york stock exchange 

   on february 28 2005 the closing sale price of our common stock as reported by the new york stock exchange was 3058 per share as of february 28 2005 there were approximately 7069 holders of record of the common stock 

  we currently intend to retain any future earnings to fund the development and growth of our business therefore we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future 

  the company did not repurchase any of its common stock in the fourth quarter of 2004 




 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

  teledyne technologies incorporated “teledyne” is a leading provider of sophisticated electronic components instruments and communications products including defense electronics data acquisition and communications equipment for airlines and business aircraft monitoring and control instruments for industrial and environmental applications and components and subsystems for wireless and satellite communications we also provide systems engineering solutions and information technology services for space defense and industrial applications and manufacture general aviation and missile engines and components as well as onsite gas and power generation systems 

  we serve niche market segments where performance precision and reliability are critical our customers include major industrial and communications companies government agencies aerospace prime contractors and general aviation companies 

strategy 

  as we grow both organically and through acquisitions we are working to become a simpler and more integrated operating company over time our goal is to continue on our path of high quality revenue and earnings growth and create a more focused set of businesses that are truly superior in their niches we do this by executing on two focused fronts first by strengthening and expanding specific platforms in our core electronics instruments and systems engineering businesses through organic growth and targeted acquisitions and second by pursuing operational excellence and margin expansion initiatives to continuously improve earnings in addition operational excellence to teledyne means the rapid integration of the businesses we acquire we continually evaluate our product lines to ensure that they are aligned with our strategy 

recent acquisitions 

  after completing one acquisition in each of 2001 and 2002 and two acquisitions in 2003 we completed five acquisitions during our fiscal year ended 2004 

  we furthered our strategy to expand our presence in the environmental instrumentation market on february 27 2004 we acquired assets of hudson new hampshirebased leeman labs inc “leeman” a manufacturer of spectrometers used by environmental and quality control laboratories to detect low levels of inorganic contaminants in water and other environmental samples which products complement the organic analysis instruments of teledyne tekmar company a mason ohiobased company acquired in 2003 on june 18 2004 we acquired isco inc “isco” located in lincoln nebraska and a leading producer of water quality monitoring instruments including samplers flow meters and online process analyzers which are complementary to teledyne’s existing environmental instrumentation product lines 

  our acquisitions have also focused on enhancing our aerospace and defense electronics businesses on july 2 2004 we completed the acquisition of reynolds industries incorporated “reynolds” a supplier of specialized high voltage connectors and subassemblies for defense aerospace and industrial applications with operations in california and the united kingdom reynolds industries had historically supplied its high voltage connectors and cables to our traveling wave tubes 

  two of our 2004 acquisitions furthered our strategy to develop a broader line of microwave products for our defense customers on december 31 2003 we acquired assets of the filtronic solid state “solid state” business located in santa clara california this business which was subsequently moved over a short time period to our facility in mountain view california designs and manufactures customized microwave subassemblies for electronic warfare radar and other military applications its precision yigbased oscillators filters and amplifiers serve some of the same customers of and are used on some of the same military programs as those of our longerstanding teledyne wireless and teledyne microwave electronic components “mec” business units 

  on october 22 2004 we acquired the assets of the defense electronics business of celeritek inc “celeritek” based in santa clara california the solid state amplifiers and microwave subassemblies of 

29 this defense electronics business utilize design and manufacturing technology similar to teledyne microwave and are complementary with teledyne mec’s line of high power helix traveling wave tubes used on military electronic warfare radar and communications applications like the solid state acquisition to obtain various synergies the operations of this business have been moved to and consolidated with our facility in mountain view california 

  on january 3 2005 in an effort to streamline operations and reduce costs the businesses principally operating as teledyne microwave located in mountain view california and teledyne mec located in rancho cordova california were consolidated into one legal entity teledyne wireless inc a whollyowned subsidiary of the company teledyne wireless inc had been the subsidiary that bought the defense electronics assets of each of solid state and celeritek 

  all of the acquisitions are part of our electronics and communications segment their results are included in our consolidated financial statements since their respective dates of acquisition since the acquisition of certain assets of the filtronic solid state business occurred after teledyne’s 2003 fiscal year this acquisition is not reflected in the balance sheet or income statement at yearend 2003 

  our fiscal year is determined based on a 52 or 53week convention ending on the sunday nearest to december 31 the following is our financial information for 2004 2003 and 2002 in millions except pershare amounts 

   we operate in four business segments electronics and communications systems engineering solutions aerospace engines and components and energy systems the segments’ respective contributions as a percentage of total sales for 2004 2003 and 2002 are summarized in the following table 

 30 results of operations 

    

   we reported 2004 net sales of 10166 million compared with net sales of 8407 million for 2003 net income was 417 million 124 per diluted share for 2004 compared with 297 million 091 per diluted share for 2003 

  the increase in sales in 2004 compared with 2003 reflected improvement in all four reporting segments the largest increase in sales was in the electronic and communications segment which grew both organically and through strategic acquisitions including tekmar company acquired in may 2003 spirent’s aviation information solutions businesses acquired in june 2003 filtronic solid states’ defense assets acquired in december 2003 leeman labs’ assets acquired in february 2004 isco inc acquired in june 2004 reynolds industries inc acquired in july 2004 and celeritek’s defense assets acquired in october 2004 the incremental increase in revenue from acquisitions in 2004 compared with 2003 was 986 million 

  the increase in segment operating profit and other segment income for 2004 compared with 2003 reflected improved results in the electronics and communications system engineering solutions and energy systems segments partially offset by lower operating profit in the aerospace engines and components segment the largest increase was in the electronic and communications segment and included incremental operating profit from acquisitions and related synergies of 118 million 

  cost of sales in total dollars was higher in 2004 compared with 2003 the increase was primarily due to higher sales which resulted from organic growth and acquisitions fiscal year 2004 included 05 million in lifo expense compared with a 51 million in lifo income in 2003 cost of sales as a percentage of net sales for 2004 was lower compared with 2003 the lower cost of sales percentage in 2004 reflected a lower cost of sales percentage for recent acquisitions which due to the nature of their business carry a 

31 lower cost of sales percentage than most of teledyne’s other businesses the cost of sales percentage for 2004 for teledyne’s existing businesses was relatively flat compared with 2003 

  selling general and administrative expenses including research and development and bid and proposal expense in total dollars were higher in 2004 compared with 2003 this increase was primarily due to higher sales which resulted from organic growth and acquisitions as well as higher corporate general and administrative expenses offset in part by lower bid and proposal expense in the systems engineering solutions segment the higher corporate expense was impacted by internal and external costs related to sarbanesoxley act section 404 compliance and auditing efforts and higher compensation expense selling general and administrative expenses for 2004 as a percentage of sales were higher compared with 2003 and reflected higher corporate expenses and also reflected a higher selling expense percentage for recent acquisitions which due to the nature of their business carry a higher selling expense percentage than most of teledyne’s existing businesses partially offset by lower bid and proposal spending 

  included in operating profit in 2004 was pension expense of 87 million of which 05 million was recoverable in accordance with us government cost accounting standards cas from certain government contracts included in 2003 operating profit was 69 million of pension expense of which none was recoverable in accordance with cas the increase in pension expense in 2004 compared with 2003 reflects in part a reduction in the discount rate assumption for the company’s defined benefit plan as well as the decline in the market value of the company’s pension assets during 2002 2001 and 2000 

  the company’s effective tax rate for 2004 was 387 compared with 333 for 2003 total year 2003 reflected an income tax benefit of 24 million due to the reversal of an income tax contingency reserve which was determined to be no longer needed during the third quarter of 2003 excluding this benefit the company’s effective tax rate for 2003 would have been 387 

  sales under contracts with the us government were approximately 43 of net sales in 2004 and 46 in 2003 international sales represented approximately 19 in 2004 and 16 of net sales in 2003 

  total interest expense including facility fees and other bank charges was 22 million in 2004 and 10 million in 2003 interest income was 03 million in 2004 and 02 million in 2003 the higher interest expense in 2004 reflected interest on debt incurred for acquisitions 

  other income for 2004 included the receipt of 25 million pursuant to an agreement with honda motor co ltd which is included as part of the aerospace engines and components segment operating profit and other segment income for segment reporting purposes in 2003 we recorded a 23 million charge in other expense for the writeoff of the company’s remaining costbased investment in a private company engaged in manufacturing and development of micro optics and microelectromechanical devices fiscal years 2004 and 2003 also include sublease rental income and royalty income in other income 

    

   we reported 2003 net sales of 8407 million compared with net sales of 7727 million for 2002 net income was 297 million 091 per diluted share for 2003 compared with 254 million 077 per diluted share for 2002 

  the increase in sales in 2003 compared with 2002 reflected improvement in all four reporting segments the largest sales growth was in the electronic and communications segment notwithstanding a difficult environment in some of the companies commercial markets the higher sales in electronics and communications segment resulted from both organic growth and strategic acquisitions including monitor labs acquired in september 2002 tekmar company acquired in may 2003 and spirent’s aviation information solutions businesses acquired in june 2003 the incremental increase in revenue from acquisitions in 2003 compared with 2002 was 399 million 

  the increase in segment operating profit for 2003 compared with 2002 reflected improved results in the system engineering solutions aerospace engines and components and energy systems segments partially offset by lower operating profit in the electronics and communications segment the electronic and communications segment included incremental operating profit from acquisitions and related synergies of 19 million 

  cost of sales in total dollars was higher in 2003 compared with 2002 the increase was in line with higher sales and also reflected higher pension expense partially offset by product mix differences cost of sales as a percentage of net sales for 2003 was relatively flat compared with 2002 while the percentages were comparable the 2003 percentage reflected the impact of pension expense compared with pension income in 2002 the impact was offset in part by product mix differences and 51 million in lifo income in 2003 compared with 08 million in lifo income in 2002 total year 2003 also reflected an improvement in cost of sales as a percentage of sales due to finalization of award and incentive fee negotiations for work performed on certain contracts in prior years in the systems engineering solutions 

33 segment at december 29 2002 teledyne recorded income of 01 million following the final resolution of the 2001 restructuring asset impairment and other charge 

  selling general and administrative expenses including research and development and bid and proposal expense in total dollars were higher in 2003 compared with 2002 this increase was in line with higher sales which resulted from organic growth and acquisitions the increased bid and proposal expense was primarily driven by bidding opportunities in the systems engineering solutions segment selling general and administrative expenses for 2003 as a percentage of sales were relatively flat compared with 2002 reflecting the benefit of higher sales and continued cost control 

  included in operating profit in 2003 was pension expense of 69 million compared with pension income of 23 million in 2002 the increase in pension expense in 2003 compared with 2002 reflects in part a reduction in the discount rate assumption for the company’s defined benefit plan as well as the decline in the market value of the company’s pension assets during 2002 2001 and 2000 

  the company’s effective tax rate for 2003 was 333 compared with 397 for 2002 total year 2003 reflected an income tax benefit of 24 million due to the reversal of an income tax contingency reserve which was determined to be no longer needed during the third quarter of 2003 excluding this benefit the company’s effective tax rate for 2003 would have been 387 

  sales under contracts with the us government were approximately 46 of net sales in 2003 and 2002 international sales represented approximately 16 of net sales in 2003 and 2002 

  total interest expense including facility fees and other bank charges was 10 million in 2003 and 09 million in 2002 interest income was 02 million in 2003 and 03 million in 2002 

  in 2003 we recorded a 23 million charge in other expense for the writeoff of the company’s remaining costbased investment in a private company engaged in manufacturing and development of micro optics and microelectromechanical devices in 2002 we recorded a 05 million charge in other expense related to the partial writedown of this investment fiscal years 2003 and 2002 also include sublease rental income and royalty income in other income 

2001 restructuring asset impairment and other charge information 

  in 2001 the company recorded a 264 million pretax charge of which 75 million was for asset impairments 88 million was for restructuring and other charges 98 million was for inventory writedowns and a 03 million pretax charge for discontinued operations 

  during 2002 the company completed the efforts related to the 2001 charge recording actual expenses of 263 million at yearend 2002 the cumulative restructuring charges were 81 million 07 million lower than the 2001 yearend estimate the cumulative charges to cost of sales related to excess and obsolete inventory were 104 million 06 million higher than the 2001 yearendestimate with no change to either the asset impairment charge or the charge for discontinued operations this resulted in 02 million of income in the electronics and communications segment in 2002 and an additional cost impact of 01 million in the systems engineering segment during 2002 no amounts remain on the balance sheet related to the charge 

34 segments 

  the following discussion of our four segments should be read in conjunction with note 14 to the notes to consolidated financial statements

  sales in 2004 compared with 2003 reflected revenue growth in defense electronic products electronic instruments telecommunication subsystems avionics products and relay products this growth was partially offset by lower sales from electronic manufacturing services primarily driven by lower government sales the revenue growth in defense electronic products was driven by sales of traveling wave tubes and ejection seat sequencers the acquisition of reynolds industries incorporated on july 2 2004 and the acquisition of assets of filtronic solid state on december 31 2003 electronic instruments revenue for 2004 compared 2003 was favorably impacted by the acquisition of isco on june 18 2004 the acquisition of leeman labs’ assets on february 27 2004 increased shipments of geophysical sensors for the petroleum exploration market and increased sales of other instrument products electronic instruments revenue for 2004 compared with 2003 was also favorably impacted by the acquisition of tekmar company on may 16 2003 the revenue growth in avionics products was favorably impacted by the acquisition of the aviation information solutions “ais” businesses from spirent plc on june 27 2003 the increase in revenue from acquisitions for 2004 compared with 2003 was 986 million incremental operating profit from acquisitions including synergies for 2004 compared with 2003 was 118 million segment operating profit was favorably impacted by acquisitions and organic sales growth partially offset by an increase in pension expense pension expense was 60 million for 2004 compared with pension expense of 51 million in 2003 operating profit in 2003 was favorably impacted by a 18 million reduction in lifo reserve which resulted from a reduced inventory level mostly offset by a 09 million fourth quarter writedown on slow moving test equipment inventory and contract settlements totaling 08 million no lifo adjustment was made in 2004 

  2003 compared with 2002 

  our electronics and communications segment sales were 4469 million in 2003 compared with sales of 3880 million in 2002 operating profit was 330 million in 2003 compared with 359 million in 2002 

  sales in 2003 compared with 2002 reflected revenue growth in defense electronic products electronic manufacturing services avionics products electronic instruments medical products and commercial 

35 lighting products the revenue growth in defense electronic products was driven by traveling wave tubes and military microelectronics the revenue growth in electronic manufacturing services was driven by increased sales to military customers revenue growth in avionics products was driven by the acquisition of the aviation information solutions businesses in june 2003 partially offset by continued weakness in the commercial aviation market electronic instruments revenue was favorably impacted by the acquisition of monitor labs incorporated at the end of the third quarter of 2002 and the acquisition of tekmardohrmann in may 2003 this revenue growth in electronic instruments was partially offset by reduced sales of geophysical sensors for the petroleum exploration market the increase in revenue from acquisitions for 2003 compared with 2002 was 399 million incremental operating profit from acquisitions including synergies for 2003 compared with 2002 was 19 million operating profit in 2003 was favorably impacted by increased sales and a 18 million reduction in lifo reserve which resulted from a reduced inventory level compared with lifo income of 06 million in 2002 these operating profit improvements were more than offset by a 09 million fourth quarter writedown on slow moving test equipment inventory contract settlements totaling 08 million and higher pension expense in 2002 the company recorded a 08 million writedown of certain optoelectronics equipment due to lower than expected utilization segment operating profit in 2003 included 51 million of pension expense compared with 20 million of pension income in 2002

  sales for 2004 compared with 2003 reflected revenue growth in core defense and environmental and aerospace programs the higher operating profit in 2004 compared with 2003 was primarily due to higher sales and improved margins on various time and material contracts operating profit in 2003 was negatively impacted by the recognition of a 10 million loss on an office sublease agreement segment operating profit in 2004 included 08 million of pension expense of which 05 million was recoverable in accordance with cas from certain government contracts compared with 03 million of pension expense in 2003 of which none was recoverable in accordance with cas 

   our systems engineering solutions segment sales were 2125 million in 2003 compared with sales of 2067 million in 2002 operating profit was 232 million in 2003 compared with 206 million in 2002 

36   sales in 2003 compared with 2002 reflected increased work in environmental and core defense programs partially offset by lower sales in aerospace programs operating profit in 2003 compared with 2002 was favorably impacted by increased sales and 41 million related to both the finalization of negotiation of prior year award and incentive fees for work performed on certain contracts primarily the groundbased midcourse defense and pressurents propellants and calibration contracts operating profit in 2003 also reflected improved margins for environmental programs operating profit in 2003 was negatively impacted by the recognition of a 10 million loss on an office sublease agreement segment operating profit in 2003 included 03 million of pension expense compared with 02 million of pension income in 2002 

aerospace engines and components 

   our aerospace engines and components segment principally through teledyne continental motors inc focuses on the design development and manufacture of piston engines turbine engines electronic engine controls and aviation batteries 

   our aerospace engines and components segment sales were 1818 million in 2004 compared with sales of 1655 million in 2003 operating profit was 61 million in 2004 compared with 64 million in 2003 

  sales in 2004 compared with 2003 reflected revenue growth in oem piston engines aftermarket piston engines and parts sales and slightly higher turbine engine sales turbine engine sales for 2004 compared with 2003 were higher primarily due to increased spare parts sale and favorable joint airtosurface standoff missile “jassm” engine sales partially offset by reduced improved tactical airlaunched decoy “itald” and harpoon cruise missile engines operating profit in 2004 included the receipt of 25 million pursuant to an agreement with honda motor co ltd related to the piston engine business while the terms of the piston engine agreement are confidential the company anticipates receiving 50 million in 2005 and 25 million in 2006 under the agreement segment operating profit for 2004 also reflected a 48 million increase in aircraft product liability insurance costs and self insurance reserve expense a 17 million charge for environmental matters and lifo expense of 05 million operating profit in the piston engine business in 2003 was positively impacted by a 33 million reduction in lifo reserve which resulted from a reduced inventory level segment operating profit in 2004 included 15 million of pension expense compared with 13 million of pension expense in 2003 

   our aerospace engines and components segment sales were 1655 million in 2003 compared with sales of 1629 million in 2002 operating profit was 64 million in 2003 compared with 27 million in 2002 

  sales in 2003 compared with 2002 reflected revenue growth in oem piston engines partially offset by reduced sales of aftermarket products and services operating profit in the piston engine business was positively impacted by an improved cost structure productivity improvements and a 33 million reduction in lifo reserve which resulted from a reduced inventory level partially offset by an increase of 

37 41 million for aircraft product liability insurance costs and self insurance reserve expense operating profit in 2002 included 02 million from a reduction in lifo reserve sales from turbine engines were unfavorably impacted by lower revenue from spare parts for air force training aircraft and lower harpoon cruise missile engine sales partially offset by higher revenue from itald engines and favorable joint airtosurface standoff missile “jassm” engine sales operating profit for turbine engines was lower in 2003 compared with 2002 and resulted from lower sales and a less favorable product mix segment operating profit in 2003 included 13 million of pension expense compared with 05 million of pension income in 2002 

energy systems 

   our energy systems segment through teledyne energy systems inc provides onsite gas and power generation systems based on proprietary electrolysis thermoelectric and fuel cell technologies 

   our energy systems segment sales were 247 million in 2004 compared with sales of 158 million in 2003 the 2004 operating income was 16 million compared with a 2003 operating loss of 07 million 

  the increase in sales for 2004 compared with 2003 resulted from multiyear government contracts which were awarded in 2003 for fuel cell and thermoelectric power generator work operating profit for 2004 compared with the operating loss in 2003 was favorably impacted by the growth in sales and by a reduction in research and development costs the operating loss in 2003 included 04 million in charges for contract claims and the recognition of a 05 million loss on a facility sublease agreement segment operating profit included pension expense of 01 million in 2004 compared with no pension expense in 2003

  sales in 2003 reflected revenue growth in government programs related to multiyear contracts which were won in 2003 primarily for thermoelectric generator development partially offset by reduction in commercial revenue primarily hydrogen generator sales the reduction in operating loss for 2003 compared with 2002 resulted from increased sales an improved overhead cost structure reduced general and administrative and research and development expenses and the absence of 03 million in program cost adjustments that impacted 2002 partially offset by 04 million in charges for contract claims and the recognition of a 05 million loss on a facility sublease agreement 

38 financial condition liquidity and capital resources 

   our principal capital requirements are to fund working capital needs capital expenditures and debt service requirements as well as to fund acquisitions it is anticipated that operating cash flow together with available borrowings under the credit facility described below will be sufficient to meet these requirements and could be used to fund some acquisitions in the year 2005 to support acquisitions we may need to raise additional capital our liquidity is not dependent upon the use of offbalance sheet financial arrangements we have no offbalance sheet financing arrangements that incorporate the use of special purpose entities or unconsolidated entities 

   in june 2004 the company terminated its then existing 2000 million fiveyear revolving credit agreement and replaced it with a new 2800 million credit facility that expires in june 2009 excluding interest and fees no payments are due under the credit facility until the credit facility terminates available borrowing capacity under the 2800 million credit facility which is reduced by borrowings and outstanding letters of credit was 2030 million at yearend 2004 for a description of some terms of our credit facility see “financing activities” on page 43 

contractual obligations 

  the following table summarizes our expected cash outflows resulting from financial contracts and commitments at january 2 2005 we have not included information on our normal recurring purchases of materials for use in our operations these amounts are generally consistent from year to year closely reflect our levels of production and are not longterm in nature in millions 

  

   the amounts above exclude our minimum funding requirements as set forth by erisa which are 246 million over the next two years our minimum funding requirements after 2004 are dependent on several factors we also have payments due under our other postretirement benefits plans these plans are not required to be funded in advance but are pay as you go see further discussion in note 13 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

operating activities 

  in 2004 net cash provided from continuing operations was 849 million compared with 568 million in 2003 and 742 million in 2002 the higher net cash provided from continuing operations for 2004 compared with 2003 reflected improved net income and lower aircraft product liability settlement payments as well as operating cash flow from acquisitions partially offset by defined benefit pension contributions of 31 million the deferred income tax component of the cash flow statement reflected a 68 million increase in 2004 a 76 million decrease in 2003 and a 152 million increase in 2002 related 

39 to the minimum pension liability adjustment recorded in each year this adjustment had no impact on cash flows from operations in 2004 

  the decrease in net cash provided from continuing operations in 2003 compared with 2002 reflected timing differences related to accounts payable differences in the cash impact of income taxes higher payments in 2003 for aircraft product liability settlements and higher accounts receivables balances the higher accounts receivables balances reflected the impact of higher sales in december 2003 compared to december 2002 in 2003 cash was used to pay down accounts payable compared to an increase in accounts payable for 2002 resulting primarily from timing of inventory and capital purchases the deferred income tax and the accrued pension obligation components of the cash flow statement in 2003 were both affected by the deferred tax amount of 76 million related to the minimum pension liability adjustment recorded in 2003 this adjustment had no impact on cash flows from continuing operations in 2003 

  fiscal years 2003 and 2002 reflected payments for workers compensation claims the 2002 cash used by discontinued operations also reflected the payment of a purchase price adjustment 

   working capital was 1244 million at yearend 2004 compared with 1295 million at yearend 2003 the decrease in working capital was due to lower cash balances offset in part by working capital from recent acquisitions the lower cash balances reflects cash used to pay down debt incurred for recent acquisitions we continue to emphasize improvements in working capital management 

balance sheet changes 

  the changes in the following selected components of teledyne balance sheet are discussed below in millions 

   the lower balance in cash and cash equivalents at january 2 2005 compared with december 28 2003 reflected cash used to acquire businesses and capital spending partially offset by positive cash flow from operations the higher balance in accounts receivables inventory property plant and equipment and accounts payable reflected the impact of businesses acquired in 2004 the increase in longterm deferred income taxes reflected the 68 million increase related to the minimum pension liability adjustment goodwill and acquired intangible assets reflect the impact of acquisitions the increase in shortterm accrued liabilities reflected liabilities for businesses acquired in 2004 and higher compensation accruals the increase in other longterm liabilities reflected an increase in the aircraft product liability reserve the accrued pension obligation increased primarily as a result of the increase in the unfunded pension liability in 2004 partially offset by pension contributions the change in the accumulated other comprehensive loss 

40 reflected the 109 million noncash adjustment related to the increase in the unfunded pension liability in 2004 the adjustment to the accumulated other comprehensive loss component of equity was required since the difference between the value of the company’s pension assets and the accumulated pension benefit obligation was larger as of yearend 2004 compared with yearend 2003 the “unfunded pension liability” the reduction to equity did not affect net income and was recorded net of 68 million in deferred taxes the increase in longterm debt and capital lease obligations resulted from cash used to acquire businesses in 2004 and a capital lease assumed in the reynolds acquisition 

   net cash used in investing activities included capital expenditures as presented below 

capital expenditures 

   during 2005 we plan to invest approximately 230 million in capital principally to reduce manufacturing costs to introduce new products and to upgrade capital equipment commitments at january 2 2005 for capital expenditures were approximately 26 million

  in june 2004 the company terminated its then existing 2000 million fiveyear revolving credit agreement and replaced it with a new 2800 million credit facility that expires in june 2009 at yearend 2004 we had 2030 million of available committed credit under the credit facility which can be utilized as needed for daily operating and periodic cash needs including acquisitions borrowings under the credit facility bear interest at our option at a rate based on either a defined base rate or the london interbank offered rate libor plus applicable margins the credit agreement also provides for facility fees that vary between 015 and 030 of the credit line depending on our capitalization ratio as calculated from time to time the credit agreement requires the company to comply with various financial and operating covenants including maintaining certain consolidated leverage and interest coverage ratios as well as minimum net worth levels and limits on acquired debt total debt at yearend 2004 includes the 700 million outstanding under the credit facility and 32 million assumed in the isco acquisition of which 31 million is current the company also assumed a 39 million capital lease in the reynolds acquisition of which 01 million is current we also had 05 million in longterm debt outstanding at yearend 2004 under a 50 million uncommitted bank facility this credit line is utilized as needed for periodic cash needs at january 2 2005 the company had 100 million in outstanding letters of credit 

  in march 2003 teledyne announced that its board of directors authorized the company to purchase from time to time up to one million shares of its common stock in open market or privately negotiated transactions through march 31 2004 no repurchases were made under the program 

   in connection with the spinoff a defined benefit pension plan was established and teledyne assumed the existing pension obligations for all of the employees both active and inactive at the operations which perform government contract work and for active employees at operations which do not perform government contract work ati transferred pension assets to fund the new defined benefit pension plan the company has changed its retirement benefits for nonunion new hires as of january 1 2004 nonunion new hires participate in an enhanced defined contribution plan as opposed to the company’s existing defined benefit plan currently teledyne anticipates making an aftertax cash contribution of approximately 90 million to its defined benefit pension plan in 2005 also under one of its spinoff 

43 agreements after november 29 2004 the company is able to charge pension costs to the us government under certain government contracts in accordance with cas 

  statement of financial accounting standard “sfas” no 87 “employers’ accounting for pensions” requires that a minimum pension liability be recorded if the value of pension assets is less than the accumulated pension benefit obligation this condition existed since yearend 2002 in accordance with the requirements of sfas no 87 the company has a 227 million noncash reduction to stockholders’ equity a longterm intangible asset of 72 million and a longterm additional pension liability of 443 million at yearend 2004 as of yearend 2003 the company had a 118 million noncash reduction to stockholders’ equity a longterm intangible asset of 85 million and an additional longterm pension liability of 279 million the adjustments to equity did not affect net income and are recorded net of deferred taxes the reduction will be reversed should the value of the pension assets exceed the accumulated pension benefit obligation as of a future measurement date see note 13 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional pension disclosures 

other matters 

   as noted earlier the company’s effective tax rate for 2004 was 387 compared with 333 for 2003 and 397 for 2002 total year 2003 reflected an income tax benefit of 24 million due to the reversal of an income tax contingency reserve which was determined to be no longer needed during the third quarter of 2003 excluding this benefit the company’s effective tax rate for 2003 would have been 387 based on the company’s history of operating earnings expectations of future operating earnings and potential tax planning strategies it is more likely than not that the deferred income tax assets at january 2 2005 will be realized 

   inflationary trends in recent years have been moderate we primarily use the lastin firstout method of inventory accounting that reflects current costs in the costs of goods sold these costs the increasing costs of equipment and other costs are considered in establishing sales pricing polices the company emphasizes cost containment in all aspects of its business 

   we have not utilized derivative financial instruments such as futures contracts options and swaps forward foreign exchange contracts or interest rate swaps and futures during 2004 or 2003 we believe that adequate controls are in place to monitor any hedging activities our primary exposure to market risk relates to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates we periodically evaluate these risks and have taken measures to mitigate these risks we own assets and operate facilities in countries that have been politically stable also our foreign risk management objectives are geared towards stabilizing cash flow from the effects of foreign currency fluctuations most of the company’s sales are denominated in us dollars which mitigates the effect of exchange rate changes any borrowings under the company’s revolving credit line are based on a fluctuating market interest rate and consequently the fair value of any outstanding debt should not be affected materially by changes in market interest rates overall we believe that our exposure to interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange rate changes is not material to our financial condition or results of operations 

   in connection with the spinoff teledyne and ati entered into several agreements governing the separation of our businesses and various employee benefits compensation tax indemnification and transition arrangements the company’s principal spinoff requirements including the requirement to ensure a favorable tax treatment have been satisfied three of our nine directors continue to serve on ati’s board in addition under one of our spinoff agreements the company is able to charge pension 

44 costs to the us government under certain government contracts after november 29 2004 in 2004 we purchased the “teledyne” name and related logos symbols and marks from an affiliate of ati for 412000 

  our chairman president and chief executive officer is a director of mellon financial corporation another of our directors is a former chief executive officer and director of mellon financial corporation all transactions with mellon bank na and its affiliates are effected under normal commercial terms and we believe that our relationships with mellon bank na and its affiliates are armslength mellon bank na is one of ten lenders under our 2800 million credit facility having committed up to 250 million under the facility it also provides cash management services and an uncommitted 50 million line of credit mellon bank na serves as trustee under our pension plan and provides asset management services for the plan mellon investor services llc serves as our transfer agent and registrar as well as agent under our stockholders rights plan 

   we are subject to various federal state local and international environmental laws and regulations which require that we investigate and remediate the effects of the release or disposal of materials at sites associated with past and present operations these include sites at which teledyne has been identified as a potentially responsible party under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act commonly known as superfund and comparable state laws we are currently involved in the investigation and remediation of a number of sites reserves for environmental investigation and remediation totaled approximately 35 million at january 2 2005 this amount includes 18 million for an environmental matter related to the aerospace engines and component segment as investigation and remediation of these sites proceed and new information is received the company expects that accruals will be adjusted to reflect new information based on current information we do not believe that future environmental costs in excess of those already accrued will materially and adversely affect our financial condition or liquidity however resolution of one or more of these environmental matters or future accrual adjustments in any one reporting period could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations for that period 

  for additional discussion of environmental matters see notes 2 and 16 to the notes to consolidated financial statements 

   we perform work on a number of contracts with the department of defense and other agencies and departments of the us government including subcontracts with government prime contractors sales under these contracts with the us government which included contracts with the department of defense were approximately 43 in 2004 and 46 of total sales in 2003 and in 2002 for a summary of sales to the us government by segment see note 14 to the notes to consolidated financial statements sales to the department of defense represented approximately 33 31 and 30 of total sales for 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively 

  performance under government contracts has certain inherent risks that could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business results of operations and financial condition government contracts are conditioned upon the continuing availability of congressional appropriations which usually occurs on a fiscal year basis even though contract performance may take more than one year while the overall us military budget declined in real dollars from the mid1980s through the early 1990s us defense spending has increased and is expected to continue to increase over the next few years as a result of global responses to terrorism and perceived nuclear threats notwithstanding the potential for increased defense spending delays or declines in us military expenditures in the programs in which we participate could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

  for information on accounts receivable from the us government see note 6 to the notes to consolidated financial statements 

   our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent liabilities on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including those related to product returns allowance for doubtful accounts inventories intangible assets income taxes warranty obligations pension and other postretirement benefits longterm contracts environmental workers’ compensation and general liability aircraft product liability employee dental and medical benefits and other contingencies and litigation we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances at the time the results of which form the basis for making our judgments actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions in some cases such differences may be material see “other matters — critical accounting policies” 

  the following table reflects significant reserves and valuation accounts which are estimates and based on judgments as described above at january 2 2005 and december 28 2003 

reserves and valuation accountsa 

  

 critical accounting policies 

  our critical accounting policies are those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties and may potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions we have identified the following as critical accounting policies revenue recognition impairment of longlived assets income taxes inventories and related allowance for obsolete and excess inventory aircraft product liability reserve accounting for pension plans and accounting for business combinations for additional discussion of the application of these and other accounting policies see note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

   commercial sales and revenue from us government fixedpricetype contracts are generally recorded as shipments are made or as services are rendered occasionally for certain fixedprice type contracts that require substantial performance over a long time period one or more years before shipments begin in accordance with the requirements of statement of position 811 “accounting for performance of constructiontype and certain productiontype contracts” revenues may be recorded based upon attainment of scheduled performance milestones which could be time event or expense driven in these few instances invoices are submitted to the customer under a contractual agreement and payments are made by the customer sales under costreimbursement contracts are recorded as costs are 

46 incurred and fees are earned since certain contracts extend over a long period of time all revisions in cost and funding estimates during the progress of work have the effect of adjusting the current period earnings on a cumulative catchup basis if the current contract estimate indicates a loss a provision is made for the total anticipated loss 

  the company follows the requirements of securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 101 and no 104 on revenue recognition 

  some of the company’s products are subject to specified warranties and the company provides for the estimated cost of product warranties we regularly assess the adequacy of our preexisting warranty liabilities and adjust amounts as necessary based on a review of historic warranty experience with respect to the applicable business or products as well as the length and actual terms of the warranties the product warranty reserve is included in current accrued liabilities on the balance sheet changes in the company’s product warranty reserve are as follows in millions 

 

   we monitor the recoverability of the carrying value of our longlived assets an impairment charge is recognized when events and circumstances indicate that the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by an asset including any proceeds from dispositions are less than the carrying value of the asset and the asset’s carrying value is less than its fair value our cash flow estimates are based on historical results adjusted to reflect our best estimate of future market and operating conditions the net carrying value of assets not recoverable is reduced to fair value our estimates of fair value represent our best estimate based on industry trends and reference to market rates and transactions in 2002 we determined that the carrying amounts of certain of our longlived assets were no longer recoverable based on estimates of future operating cash flows to be generated by these assets as a result in 2002 we recorded a 08 million writedown of certain optoelectronic equipment and a 05 million charge related to the partial writedown of the company’s 28 million costbased investment in a private company engaged in manufacturing and development of micro optics and microelectromechanical devices in 2003 we wroteoff the remaining 23 million of this investment 

   as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate this process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which are included within our consolidated balance sheet we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income recognizing that future taxable income may give rise to new deferred tax assets to the extent that we believe that future recovery is not likely we must establish a valuation allowance to the extent we establish or increase a valuation allowance we must include an expense within the tax provision in the income statement 

  significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets a valuation allowance of 33 million exists as of january 2 2005 in the event that actual results differ 

47 from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods we may need to adjust the valuation allowance which could impact our financial position and results of operations 

  provisions for income taxes for 2004 2003 and 2002 are subject to audit by the internal revenue service and the tax authorities in the various jurisdictions in which we do business 

   inventories are valued at the lower of cost lastin firstout firstin firstout and average cost methods or market less progress payments we primarily use the lastin firstout method of inventory accounting that reflects current costs in the costs of products sold costs include direct material direct labor applicable manufacturing and engineering overhead and other direct costs inventories have been reduced by an allowance for excess and obsolete inventories the estimated allowance is based on management’s review of inventories on hand compared to assumptions about future demand and market conditions if actual future demand or market conditions are more or less favorable than those currently projected by management adjustments may be required in 2003 we recorded a 09 million fourth quarter writedown on slow moving test equipment inventory in our electronics and communication segment total inventories at cost were net of reserves for excess slow moving and obsolete inventory of 212 million and 142 million at january 2 2005 and december 28 2003 respectively the increase from 2003 is primarily attributable to reserve balances acquired as part of acquisitions made in 2004 

   we are currently involved in certain legal proceedings related to aircraft product liability claims we have accrued an estimate of the probable costs for the resolution of these claims this estimate has been developed in consultation with our insurers outside counsel handling our defense in these matters and historical experience and is based upon an analysis of potential results assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies we do not believe these proceedings will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position it is possible however that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by specific events occurring in the period changes in our assumptions or the effectiveness of our strategies related to these proceedings the company has aircraft and product liability insurance however based on a review of claims experience changes to the claims management process and an analysis of available options the company in 2004 increased its annual selfinsurance retention for general aviation aircraft liabilities incurred in connection with products manufactured by teledyne continental motors to 250 million from 150 million and as a result lowered its annual insurance premium we cannot assure that for 2005 and in future years our ability to obtain insurance or the premiums for such insurance or the amount of our selfinsured retention or reserves will not be negatively impacted by our experience in prior years or other factors our current aircraft product liability insurance policy expires may 2005 

   teledyne has a defined benefit pension plan covering most of its employees the company accounts for its defined benefit pension plan in accordance with sfas no 87 — “employers’ accounting for pensions” which requires that amounts recognized in financial statements be determined on an actuarial basis rather than as contributions are made to the plan a significant element in determining the company’s pension income or expense in accordance with sfas no 87 is the expected return on plan assets the company has assumed based upon the types of securities the plan assets are invested in and the longterm historical returns of these investments that the longterm expected return on pension assets will be 85 in 2005 compared with 85 in 2004 and its assumed discount rate will be 625 in 2005 compared with 65 in 2004 the company made an aftertax contribution of 19 million to its pension plan in 2004 and anticipates making an aftertax cash contribution of approximately 90 million to its pension plan in 2005 the assumed longterm rate of return on assets is applied to the marketrelated value of plan assets at the end of the previous year this produces the expected return on plan assets that is included in annual pension income or expense for the current year the cumulative difference between 

48 this expected return and the actual return on plan assets is deferred and amortized into pension income or expense over future periods as noted earlier since the value of the company’s pension assets were less than the accumulated pension benefit obligation in accordance with the requirements of sfas no 87 the company has a 227 million noncash reduction to stockholders’ equity a longterm intangible asset of 72 million and an additional longterm pension liability of 443 million at yearend 2004 the adjustment to equity did not affect net income and is net of deferred taxes of 144 million the charge will be reversed should the value of the pension assets exceed the accumulated pension benefit obligation as of a future measurement date see note 13 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional pension disclosures 

   the company accounts for goodwill and purchased intangible assets under statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 141 “business combinations” and sfas no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” business acquisitions are accounted for under the purchase method by assigning the purchase price to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at their fair values and the excess of the purchase price over the amounts assigned is recorded as goodwill purchased intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but reviewed at least annually for impairment the company performs an annual impairment review in the fourth quarter by comparing the fair value of the reporting units which are our four business segments to their carrying values fair values are estimated using discounted cash flow methodologies that are based on projections of the amounts and timing of future revenues and cash flows based on the annual impairment review completed in the fourth quarter of 2004 no impairment of goodwill or intangible assets with indefinite lives was indicated in all acquisitions the results are included in the company’s consolidated financial statements from the date of each respective acquisition 

 

   in december 2004 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued sfas no 123r “share based payment” “sfas no 123r” that will require compensation costs related to sharebased payment transactions to be recognized in the financial statements with limited exceptions the amount of compensation costs will be measured based on the grant date — fair value of the equity or liability instrument issued compensation cost will be recognized over the period that an employee provides service in exchange for the award sfas no 123r replaces sfas no 123 “accounting for stockbased compensation” and supersedes sfas no 25 “accounting for stock issued to employees” beginning with the third quarter of 2005 teledyne plans to recognize compensation expense in accordance with fasb no 123r the adoption of this standard for the expensing of stock options is expected to reduce pretax earnings by 22 million in the second half of 2005 

   in november 2004 the fasb issued sfas no 151 “inventory costs — an amendment of arb no 43 chapter 4” “sfas no 151” sfas no 151 amends the guidance in arb no 43 chapter 4 “inventory pricing” to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense freight handling costs and wasted material spoilage sfas no 151 requires that those items be recognized as currentperiod charges sfas no 151 is effective for first fiscal years beginning after june 15 2005 the adoption of sfas no 151 is not expected to have any impact on the company 

   in december 2003 the fasb issued sfas no 132 “employers’ disclosures about pensions and other postretirement benefits” “sfas no 132” sfas no 132 requires additional information 

49 regarding the types of plan assets investment strategy measurement date plan obligations cash flows and components of net periodic benefit cost recognized during interim periods as is effective immediately upon issuance the company has included the required disclosures in note 13 to the notes to consolidated financial statements 

   in may 2003 the fasb issued sfas no 150 “accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity” “sfas no 150” this statement establishes standards for classifying and measuring as liabilities certain financial instruments that embody obligations of the issuer and have characteristics of both liabilities and equity it represents a significant change in practice in the accounting for a number of financial instruments including mandatorily redeemable equity instruments and certain equity derivatives that frequently are used in connection with share repurchase programs sfas no 150 must be applied immediately to instruments entered into or modified after may 31 2003 and to all other instruments that exist as of the beginning of the first interim financial reporting period beginning after june 15 2003 except for noncontrolling interests of a limitedlife subsidiary which has been deferred indefinitely as teledyne currently has no financial instruments that would be subject to sfas no 150 the adoption had no impact on the company 

   in april 2003 the fasb issued sfas no 149 “amendment of statement 133 on derivative instruments and hedging activities” “sfas no 149” sfas no 149 amends and clarifies accounting for derivative instruments including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts and for hedging activities under sfas no 133 sfas no 149 clarifies under what circumstances a contract with an initial net investment meets the characteristics of a derivative and when a derivative contains a financing component that warrants special reporting in the statement of cash flows sfas no 149 is generally effective for contracts entered into or modified after june 30 2003 and had no impact on teledyne’s financial position or results of operations 

   in january 2003 the fasb issued interpretation no 46 “consolidation of variable interest entities” “fin 46” fin 46 requires companies to evaluate variable interest entities to determine whether to apply the consolidation provisions of fin 46 to those entities companies must apply fin 46 to entities created after january 31 2003 and to variable interest entities in which a company obtains an interest after that date in october 2003 the fasb deferred the effective date to the first fiscal year or interim period ending after december 15 2003 to variable interest entities in which a company holds a variable interest that is acquired before february 1 2003 teledyne’s adoption of fin 46 had no impact on the company’s consolidated results of operations or financial position 

   in june 2001 the fasb issued sfas no 143 “accounting for asset retirement obligations” which addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible longlived assets and the associated asset retirement costs “sfas no 143” teledyne’ initial adoption of sfas no 143 effective january 1 2003 did not have a material effect on its financial position or results of operations 

outlook 

  based on its current outlook the company’s management believes that first quarter 2005 earnings per share will be in the range of approximately 037 to 040 the fullyear 2005 earnings per share outlook is expected to be in the range of approximately 135 to 143 the company’s estimated effective income tax rate for 2005 is 396 

50   the company’s 2005 outlook reflects anticipated sales growth in defense electronics and instrumentation businesses primarily due to the fullyear effect of the company’s acquisitions completed in 2004 organic sales growth of electronic instruments is expected to be offset by a substantial reduction in sales of geophysical sensors for the energy exploration market the company’s management expects revenue in its systems engineering segment to peak in the first quarter of 2005 due in part to favorable timing on certain chemical weapons demilitarization programs and the company’s systems engineering and technical assistance contract with the us army in addition revenues in the company’s energy systems segment and its military turbine engine business are expected to be lower in the second half of 2005 compared with the second half of 2004 

  the full year 2005 earnings outlook includes approximately 60 million or 011 per share in pension expense after recovery of allowable pension costs from our government contracts full year 2004 earnings included 87 million or 016 per share in gross pension expense or 82 million or 015 per share in net pension expense after recovery of allowable pension costs from our government contracts the decrease in pension expense reflects in part the ability to recover pension cost from the government in 2005 partially offset by increased pension liability due to a reduction in the discount rate assumption for the company’s defined benefit plan the company’s assumed discount rate is 625 in 2005 compared with 65 in 2004 

  beginning with the third quarter of 2005 the company plans to recognize compensation expense in accordance with sfas no 123 revised 2004 the adoption of this standard for the expensing of stock options is expected to reduce earnings per share by approximately 005 in the second half of 2005

accounted for more than 10 of our total sales during 2003 2002 or 2001   approximately 46 46 and 45 of our total sales for 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively were derived from contracts with agencies of and prime contractors to the us government our principal us government customer is the us department of defense in 2003 2002 and 2001 our largest program with the us government the boeing company — groundbased midcourse defense contract represented 58 75 and 74 of total sales respectively set forth below are sales by our segments to agencies and prime contractors to the us government for the periods presented us government sales    our total backlog of confirmed orders was approximately 3697 million at december 28 2003 3241 million at december 29 2002 and 3008 million at december 30 2001 sales and marketing   our sales and marketing approach varies by segment and by products within our segments a shared fundamental tenet is the commitment to work closely with our customers to understand their needs with an aim to secure preferred supplier and longerterm relationships   our business segments use a combination of internal sales forces distributors and commissioned sales representatives to market and sell our products and services products are also advertised in appropriate trade journals and by means of various websites to promote our products and other capabilities our personnel regularly participate in relevant trade shows and professional associations many of our government contracts are awarded after a competitive bidding process in which we seek to emphasize our ability to provide superior products and technical solutions in addition to competitive pricing 8   principally through teledyne technologies international corp the company has established branch offices in foreign countries to facilitate international sales for various businesses competition   we believe that technological capabilities and innovation and the ability to invest in the development of new and enhanced products are critical to obtaining and maintaining leadership in our markets and the industries in which we compete generally although we have certain advantages that we believe help us compete in our markets effectively each of our markets is highly competitive our businesses vigorously compete on the basis of quality product performance and reliability technical expertise price and service many of our competitors have and potential competitors could have greater name recognition a larger installed base of products more extensive engineering manufacturing marketing and distribution capabilities and greater financial technological and personnel resources than we do research and development   our research and development efforts primarily involve engineering and design related to improving product lines and developing new products and technologies in the same or similar fields we spent a total of 2181 million 1968 million and 2107 million on research and development and bid and proposal costs for 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively customerfunded research and development most of which was attributable to work under contracts with the us government represented approximately 87 87 and 85 of total research and development costs for 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively   in 2003 approximately 63 of the 279 million in companyfunded research and development and bid and proposal costs were incurred in our electronics and communications businesses we expect the level of companyfunded research and development and bid and proposal costs to be approximately 318 million in 2004 intellectual property   while we own and control various intellectual property rights including patents trade secrets confidential information trademarks trade names and copyrights which in the aggregate are of material importance to our business our management believes that our business as a whole is not materially dependent upon any one intellectual property or related group of such properties we own several hundred active patents and are licensed to use certain patents technology and other intellectual property rights owned and controlled by others similarly other companies are licensed to use certain patents technology and other intellectual property rights owned and controlled by us   patents patent applications and license agreements will expire or terminate over time by operation of law in accordance with their terms or otherwise we do not expect the expiration or termination of these patents patent applications and license agreements to have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition   in connection with our spinoff in 1999 an affiliate of ati granted us an exclusive license to use the “teledyne” name and related logos symbols and marks in connection with our operations the annual fee is 100000 for this license and on november 24 2004 we have an option to purchase all rights and

abbeville alabama under a collective bargaining agreement that expires on october 15 2004 we consider our relations with our employees to be good 

executive management   tdy’s executive management includes  10  11  

   dr mehrabian has an amended and restated employment agreement with teledyne technologies which provides that we will employ him as the chairman president and chief executive officer the agreement terminates on december 31 of each year but will be extended annually unless either party gives the other written notice prior to october 31 of the year of such term that it will not be extended starting september 1 2003 dr mehrabian’s annual base salary was 610000 the agreement provides that dr mehrabian is entitled to participate in tdy’s annual incentive bonus plan and other executive compensation and benefit programs the agreement provides dr mehrabian with a nonqualified pension arrangement under which teledyne technologies will pay him following his retirement as payments supplemental to any accrued pension under our qualified pension plan an amount equal to 50 of his base compensation as in effect at retirement the number of years for which such annual amount shall be paid will be equal to the number of years of his service to tdy including service to ati but not more than 10 years   fourteen current members of management have entered into change in control severance agreements with teledyne technologies the agreements have a threeyear automatically renewing term under the agreements the executive is entitled to severance benefits if 1 there is a change in control of tdy and 2 within three months before or 24 months after the change in control either we terminate the executive’s employment for reasons other than for cause or the executive terminates employment for good reason “severance benefits” consist of  12  risk factors cautionary statement as to forwardlooking statements   the following text highlights various risks and uncertainties associated with teledyne technologies these factors could materially affect “forwardlooking statements” within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 that we may from time to time make including forwardlooking statements contained in “item 1 business” and “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” of this form 10k and in tdy’s 2003 annual report to stockholders our dependence on revenue from government contracts subjects us to many risks including the risk that we may not be successful in bidding for future contracts and the risk that us government funding for our existing contracts may be diverted to other uses or delayed   we perform work on a number of contracts with the department of defense and other agencies and departments of the us government sales under contracts with the us government as a whole including sales under contracts with the department of defense as prime contractor or subcontractor represented approximately 46 of our total revenue for 2003 performance under government contracts has certain inherent risks that could have a material effect on our business results of operations and financial condition   government contracts are conditioned upon the continuing availability of congressional appropriations congress typically appropriates funds for a given program on a fiscalyear basis even though contract performance may take more than one year as a result at the beginning of a major program a contract is typically only partially funded and additional monies are normally committed to the contract by the procuring agency only as congress makes appropriations available for future fiscal years   the overall us military budget declined in real dollars from the mid1980s through the early 1990 however as a result of the september 11th terrorist attacks and the war in iraq us defense spending has increased and is expected to increase over the next few years increased defense spending does not necessarily correlate to increased business for the company because not all the programs in which tdy participates or has current capabilities may be provided with increased funding the middle east situation 13 could result in a diversion of funds from programs in which tdy participates and redirection of those funds to pay for costs associated with this situation or programs more closely related to it 

  also over time programs can evolve and affect the extent of our participation for example one of teledyne brown engineering’s programs was restructured in 2003 to change the emphasis from a focus on test and evaluation to a focus on deployment and sustainment which resulted in a nearly 16 decline in revenues from this contract compared to 2002 from 58 million to 49 million revenues from this contract could continue to decline as this program continues to evolve away from areas that teledyne brown engineering historically supported   furthermore we obtain many us government prime contracts and subcontracts through the process of competitive bidding we may not be successful in having our bids accepted   the department of defense has revised its small business subcontracting goals for prime contractors to award 40 of the value of its contract to small andor disadvantaged businesses an increase from the prior target of 20 this reduces the available share that may be awarded to teledyne brown engineering a large business when teaming with other contractors in a subcontractor capacity when a company is acting in the prime contractor capacity this change has the effect of reducing the overall profitability on the contract because the prime contractor’s profit on the subcontracted portion of that contract is generally lower than on the portion of the contract that is performed directly by the prime contractor   the company principally and traditionally through its systems engineering solutions segment has been a significant contributor to nasa programs the centerpiece of our current nasa activities is the international space station as a result of the columbia space shuttle tragedy nasa’s space shuttle programs could be negatively impacted depending on the duration of the grounding of shuttle flights   most of our us government contracts are subject to termination by the us government either at its convenience or upon the default of the contractor terminationforconvenience provisions provide only for the recovery of costs incurred or committed settlement expenses and profit on work completed prior to termination terminationfordefault clauses impose liability on the contractor for excess costs incurred by the us government in reprocuring undelivered items from another source   there is no guarantee that us government contracts will be profitable a number of our us government prime contracts and subcontracts are fixed pricetype contracts 44 in 2003 as compared to 41 in 2002 under these types of contracts we bear the inherent risk that actual performance cost may exceed the fixed contract price this is particularly true where the contract was awarded and the price finalized in advance of final completion of design we believe that the us government is increasingly requesting proposals for fixed pricetype contracts   certain fees under some of our us government contracts are linked to meeting development or testing deadlines fees may also be influenced or dependent on the collective efforts and success of other defense contractors over which we had no or limited control in our systems engineering solutions segment given the finalization of actual fee negotiations for work performed on certain government contracts in prior periods the level of government award and incentive fees received in 2003 will not continue in 2004   we like other government contractors are subject to various audits reviews and investigations including private party “whistleblower” lawsuits relating to our compliance with federal and state laws in addition we have a compliance program designed to surface issues that may lead to voluntary disclosures to the us government generally claims arising out of these us government inquiries and voluntary disclosures can be resolved without resorting to litigation however should the business unit or division involved be charged with wrongdoing or should the us government determine that the unit or division is not a “presently responsible contractor” that unit or division and conceivably our company as a whole could be temporarily suspended or in the event of a conviction could be debarred for up to three years from receiving new government contracts or governmentapproved subcontracts in addition we could expend substantial amounts in defending against such charges and in damages fines and penalties if such charges are proven or result in negotiated settlements in october 2002 the company was informed 14 that the us government had declined to intervene in a lawsuit filed more than four years before under seal pursuant to the false claims act the company intends to vigorously defend this continuing civil action against its electronic safety products unit which action continues notwithstanding the us government’s nonintervention and the court’s granting of the company’s motion to dismiss the civil action which decision has been appealed 

a declining stock market and lower interests rates negatively affect the value of our pension assets and could have a material adverse financial effect on us   we have a defined benefit pension plan covering substantially all of our employees at yearend 2003 notwithstanding improved market conditions because of significant declines in the stock market over the last few years and low interest rates the value of the pension assets was less than our accumulated pension benefit obligation the accounting rules applicable to our pension plan require that amounts recognized in financial statements to be determined on an actuarial basis rather than as contributions are made to the plan two significant elements in determining our pension income or pension expense are the expected return on plan assets and the discount rate used in projecting pension benefit obligations we have assumed based on the type of securities in which the plan assets are invested and the longterm historical returns of these investments that the longterm expected return on pension assets will continue to be 85 in 2004 as it was in 2003 compared to 90 in 2002 and the assumed discount rate will be 65 in 2004 compared to 70 in 2003 and 75 in 2002   since the spinoff through 2002 we recorded pension income starting in 2003 and in the future we expect to incur pension expense the decline in pension income and the start of pension expense in 2003 is due to the completion in 2001 of income amortization associated with the transition assets recorded pursuant to statement of financial accounting standards no 87 — “employee’s accounting for pensions” as well as the decline in the value of our pension assets coupled with reductions in our expected rate of return and discount rate assumptions used for pension plan calculations as described above we currently expect pension expense of approximately 85 million in 2004 compared to pension expense of 69 million in 2003 and pension income of 23 million for 2002 given our pension plan’s current underfunded status we will be required to make cash contributions to our pension plan in 2004 declines in the stock market and lower rates of return could increase future years required contribution also under one of our spinoff agreements the earliest we will be able to charge pension costs to the us government under our various government contracts will be november 29 2004 the addition of such costs in a bid for us government contracts which is in essence an increase to the contract price to be paid may itself negatively affect an award decision being made in favor of the company   effective january 1 2004 in an effort to help alleviate additional pension expense in future years new nonunion employee hires do not participate in the pension plan but participate in our teledyne technologies incorporated 401k plan united states’ and global responses to terrorism the middle east situation and perceived nuclear threats increase uncertainties with respect to many of our businesses and may adversely affect the company’s business and results of operations   united states’ and global responses to terrorism the middle east situation and perceived nuclear threats increase uncertainties with respect to us and other business and financial markets several factors associated directly or indirectly with terrorism the iraq situation and perceived nuclear threats and responses may adversely affect the company   while some of our businesses that provide products or services to the us government experienced greater demand for their products and services as a result of increased us government defense spending various responses could realign government programs and affect the composition funding or timing of our government programs government spending could shift to defense programs including homeland security in which we may not participate or may not have current capabilities and curtail less pressing nondefense programs in which we do participate including department of energy or nasa programs 15   the effect of the decline in air travel on the financial condition of many of our commercial airline and aircraft manufacturer customers resulting from terrorism sars and other factors could adversely affect our electronics and communications segment deterioration of financial performance of airlines could result in a further reduction of discretionary spending for upgrades of avionics and inflight communications equipment which would adversely affect our electronics and communications segment   as happened after the september 11th terrorist attacks reinstatement of flight restrictions would negatively impact the market for general aviation aircraft piston engines and components and would adversely affect our aerospace engines and components segment potential reductions in the need for general aviation aircraft maintenance due to declines in air travel could also adversely affect our aerospace engines and components segment acquisitions involve inherent risks that may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition   our growth strategy includes acquisitions at an increased pace over prior years acquisitions involve various inherent risks such as    in may 2003 for example we acquired teledyne tekmar company while this company’s products and customer base are complementary to tdy’s existing instrumentation businesses there is no assurance that we will achieve all identified financial operating and distribution synergies   similarly in connection with acquisitions we may consolidate one or more acquired facilities with other tdy facilities to obtain synergies and costsavings for example we have recently relocated the manufacturing operations of the acquired ais’ wichita kansas facility to our teledyne controls’ facility in los angeles california we are also in the process of moving manufacturing operations of our acquired solid state business from santa clara california to mountain view california despite planning relocation of manufacturing operations has inherent risks as it tends to involve among other things change of personnel and learning or adaptation of manufacturing processes and techniques production delays at the new operating location could result we may not have sufficient resources to fund all future research and development and capital expenditures or possible acquisitions   in order to remain competitive we must make substantial investments in research and development to develop new and enhanced products and continuously upgrade our process technology and manufacturing capabilities   although we believe that anticipated cash flows from operations and available borrowings under our 200 million credit facility will be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated working capital research and development and capital investment needs we may be unable to fund all of these needs or possible acquisitions our ability to raise additional capital will depend on a variety of factors some of which will not be within our control including resurgence of the public offering market investor perceptions of us our businesses and the industries in which we operate and general economic conditions we may be unable to successfully raise additional capital if needed failure to successfully raise needed capital on a timely or costeffective basis could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 16 we may be unsuccessful in our efforts to increase our participation in certain new markets   we intend to both adapt our existing technology and develop new products to expand into new market segments for example we are developing new fuel cell related technologies the market for fuel cell technologies is not well established and there are a number of companies that have announced intentions to develop and market fuel cell products some of these companies have greater financial andor technological resources than we do   we are also developing new electronic products including highdensity microprocessor connectors and microwave modules for radios used in cellular communications infrastructure which are intended to access markets in which teledyne does not currently participate we may be unsuccessful in accessing these markets if our products do not meet our customers’ requirements due to either changes in technology and industry standards or because of actions taken by our competitors we may be unable to successfully introduce new and enhanced products in a timely and costeffective manner   our operating results depend in part on our ability to introduce new and enhanced products on a timely basis successful product development and introduction depend on numerous factors including our ability to anticipate customer and market requirements changes in technology and industry standards our ability to differentiate our offerings from offerings of our competitors and market acceptance   we may not be able to develop and introduce new or enhanced products in a timely and costeffective manner or to develop and introduce products that satisfy customer requirements our new products also may not achieve market acceptance or correctly anticipate new industry standards and technological changes technological change could cause certain of our products or services to become obsolete or noncompetitive   the markets for a number of our products and services are generally characterized by rapid technological development evolving industry standards changes in customer requirements and new product introductions and enhancements a faster than anticipated change in one or more of the technologies related to our products or services or in market demand for products or services based on a particular technology could result in faster than anticipated obsolescence of certain of our products or services and could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operation and financial condition currently accepted industry standards are also subject to change which may contribute to the obsolescence of our products or services product liability claims or recalls could have a material adverse effect on our reputation business results of operations and financial condition   as a manufacturer and distributor of various products our results of operations are susceptible to adverse publicity regarding the quality or safety of our products in part product liability claims challenging the safety of our products may result in a decline in sales for a particular product which could adversely affect our results of operations this could be the case even if the claims themselves are proven untrue or settled for immaterial amounts   while we have general liability and other insurance policies concerning product liabilities we have selfinsured retentions or deductibles under such policies with respect to a portion of these liabilities for example our annual selfinsured retention for general aviation aircraft liabilities incurred in connection with products manufactured by teledyne continental motors inc is 15 million since our existing aircraft product liability insurance policy expires in may 2004 the company is currently evaluating options relating to restructuring its aircraft product liability insurance program including a greater annual selfinsured retention and perhaps use of its captive insurance subsidiary 17   product recalls and field service actions could also have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition for example teledyne continental motors had been engaged in a product recall of piston engine crankshafts whereby the company recorded a 12 million pretax charge in the second quarter of 2000 product recalls have the potential for tarnishing a company’s reputation and could have a material adverse effect on the sales of our products in 2002 we reached a monetary settlement related to the 2000 recall with two of three companies that manufactured and processed allegedly defective steel subsequently made into aircraft engine crankshafts we failed to win a jury verdict against a third company involved in making the steel the company continues to pursue cost recovery through litigation against one other materials supplier as a result of the 2000 product recall program there is no assurance that the company will recover any costs or the negative impact on its reputation   the company has been joined among a number of defendants often over 100 in lawsuits alleging injury or death as a result of exposure to asbestos we have not incurred material liabilities in connection with these lawsuits the filings typically do not identify any of the company’s products as a source of asbestos exposure and the company has been dismissed from cases for lack of product identification but only after some defense costs have been incurred also because of the prominent “teledyne” name we may be mistakenly joined in lawsuits involving a company or business that was not spun off or otherwise assumed by us as part of our 1999 spinoff the company’s historic insurance coverage including that of its predecessors may not fully cover such claims and defense of such matters as coverage depends on the year of purported exposure and other factors nonetheless the company intends to defend these claims vigorously congress has been considering tort reform to deal with the increasing number of asbestosrelated claims   the gas generators manufactured by teledyne energy systems inc currently contain a sealed wetted asbestos component while the company is currently examining replacement materials has placed warning labels on its products and takes care in handling of this material by employees there is no assurance that the company will not face product liability claims involving this component   our teledyne brown engineering’s laboratory in knoxville tennessee performs radiological analyses while the laboratory is certified by the department of energy has other nuclearrelated certifications and has internal quality controls in place errors and omissions in analyses may occur we currently have errors and omissions insurance coverage and nuclear liability insurance coverage that might apply depending on the circumstances we also have sought indemnities from some of our customers our insurance coverage or indemnities however may not be adequate to cover potential problems associated with faulty radiological analyses   while we have not sold any systems our watersabre fluid jet cutting system™ is expected to be used in antiterrorism operations a mishap involving the use of such system could result in various damages which could exceed available insurance coverages or customerprovided indemnities if obtained although we are seeking liability protections for the watersabre under the support antiterrorism by fostering effective technologies act of 2002 the process for obtaining them is newly established and no antiterrorism technologies have yet been qualified by the secretary of homeland security   we cannot assure that we will not have additional product liability claims or that we will not recall any additional products we may have difficulty obtaining product liability and other insurance coverages or be subject to increased costs for such coverage   insurance costs have increased greatly over the last few years as a manufacturer of a variety of products including aircraft engines used in general aviation aircraft we have general liability and other insurance policies that provide coverage beyond selfinsured retentions or deductibles we cannot assure that for 2004 and in future years insurance carriers will be willing to renew coverage or provide new coverage for product liability especially as it relates to general aviation if such insurance is available we may be required to pay substantially higher prices for coverage andor increase our levels of selfinsured 18 retentions or reserves the company is currently evaluating options with respect to its aircraft product liability insurance policy which expires in may 2004 in connection with the last renewal premium costs of such insurance coverage nearly doubled and the annual selfinsured retention increased 50 to alleviate aircraft product liability insurance costs the company continues to try to reduce manufacturing and other costs and also to pass on such insurance costs through price increases on its aircraft engines and spare parts the company cannot provide assurances that further cost reduction efforts will prove successful or that customers will accept additional price increases 

  for certain electronic components for medical applications that we manufacture such as those that go into cochlear implants we have asked for indemnities from our customers andor to be included under their insurance policies we cannot however provide any assurance that such indemnities or insurance will offset potential liabilities that we may incur as a result of our manufacture of such components   aside from the uncertainties created by external events such as september 11th and subsequent activities our ability to obtain product liability insurance and the cost for such insurance are affected by our historical claims experience we cannot assure that for 2004 and in future years our ability to obtain insurance or the cost for such insurance or the amount of selfinsured retentions or reserves will not be negatively impacted by our experience in prior years over the last few years our aircraft product liability claims experience has worsened due in part to an increasingly litigious environment increasing competition could reduce the demand for our products and services   although we believe that we have certain advantages that help us compete in our markets each of our markets is highly competitive many of our competitors have and potential competitors could have greater name recognition a larger installed base of products more extensive engineering manufacturing marketing and distribution capabilities and greater financial technological and personnel resources than we do new or existing competitors may also develop new technologies that could adversely affect the demand for our products and services industry consolidation trends particularly among aerospace and defense contractors could adversely affect demand for our products and services if prime contractors seek to control more aspects of vertically integrated projects we sell products and services to customers in industries that are cyclical and sensitive to changes in general economic activity   we derive significant revenues from the commercial aerospace industry domestic and international commercial aerospace markets are cyclical in nature historic demand for new commercial aircraft has been related to the stability and health of domestic and international economies delays or changes in aircraft and component orders could impact the future demand for our products and have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition while the market for commercial aircraft has shown some improvement since the downturn triggered by the tragic events of september 11th and the iraqi war another such event would increase the level of uncertainty regarding future orders for aircraft   in addition we sell products and services to customers in industries that are sensitive to the level of general economic activity and in mature industries that are sensitive to capacity adverse economic conditions affecting these industries may reduce demand for our products and services which may reduce our profits or our production levels or both we sell products to customers in industries that may undergo rapid and unpredictable changes   we develop and manufacture products for customers in industries that have undergone rapid changes in the past for example we manufacture products and provide manufacturing services to companies that serve telecommunications markets during 2001 many segments of the telecommunications market experienced a dramatic and rapid downturn that resulted in cancellations or deferrals of orders for our products and services this market segment or others that we serve may exhibit rapid changes in the future and may adversely affect our operating results or our production levels or both 19 we are subject to the risks associated with international sales   during 2003 international sales accounted for approximately 16 of our total revenues we anticipate that future international sales will continue to account for a significant percentage of our revenues risks associated with these sales include    any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition exchange rate fluctuations may negatively affect the cost of our products to international customers and therefore reduce our competitive position given the current exchange rate between the us dollar and the british pound sterling european contracts for which we are paid in us dollars could be negatively affected to the extent the underlying costs to the company to fulfill the contract are paid in pounds sterling in prior years weak conditions in asian economies have affected our results of operations adversely the september 11th terrorist attacks as well as fears of an international arms race have resulted in increased export scrutiny of sales of some of our products to international customers travel restrictions to middle eastern and other countries may negatively affect continuing international sales or service revenues from such regions compliance with increasing environmental regulations and the effects of potential environmental liabilities could have a material adverse financial effect on us   we like other industry participants are subject to various federal state local and international environmental laws and regulations we may be subject to increasingly stringent environmental standards in the future future developments administrative actions or liabilities relating to environmental matters could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition   while the company has an environmental management system and compliance program applicable to its operating facilities including a “review and audit” program to monitor compliance where each facility is reviewed and audited by an internal environmental team every three years such internal control is designed to reduce environment risk it does not eliminate potential environmental liabilities in addition as the company pursues acquisitions while it conducts environmentalrelated due diligence and generally seeks some form of protection including indemnification from a seller such acquired companies may have environmental liabilities that are not accurately assessed or brought to our attention at the time of the acquisition   some of our businesses work with highly dangerous substances that require heightened standards of care for example as a systems contractor for the us army’s program manager for nonstockpile chemical materiel we conduct research development manufacturing test and evaluation and site operations related to the safe and environmentally protective disposal of small caches of chemical munitions and materiel located in over 30 states and territories the destruction of chemical weapons is an inherently dangerous activity except for a contained fire during a demonstration testing of a process designed to access rockets in a former program we have not experienced any accidents or other adverse consequences as a result of our participation in weapon destruction programs we cannot however assure that we will not experience any problems in the future although the federal government provides certain indemnities to contractors in these programs these indemnities may be insufficient to offset liabilities that we may incur in connection with our participation in these programs 20   for additional discussion of environmental matters see the discussion under the caption “other matters — environmental” of “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition” and notes 2 and 15 to notes to consolidated financial statements our inability to attract and retain key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our future success   our future success depends to a significant extent upon the continued service of our executive officers and other key management and technical personnel and on our ability to continue to attract retain and motivate qualified personnel recruiting and retaining skilled technical personnel is highly competitive the loss of the services of one or more of our key employees or our failure to attract retain and motivate qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations we may not be able to sell or exit on acceptable terms product lines that we determine no longer meet with our growth strategy   consistent with our growth strategy to focus on markets to expand our profitable niche businesses we continually evaluate our product lines to ensure that they are aligned with our strategy our ability to dispose of product lines that may no longer be aligned with our strategy will depend on many factors including the terms and conditions of any asset purchase and sale agreement as well as industry business and economic conditions we cannot provide any assurance as to when if or on what terms any nonstrategic product lines will be sold also we cannot provide any assurance as to the availability timing terms or conditions of alternative courses of action including closure or the sale of any nonstrategic product line cannot be consummated provisions of our governing documents applicable law and our change in control severance agreements could make an acquisition of teledyne technologies more difficult   our restated certificate of incorporation amended and restated bylaws and rights agreement and the general corporation law of the state of delaware contain several provisions that could make the acquisition of control of teledyne technologies in a transaction not approved by our board of directors more difficult we have also entered into change in control severance agreements with 14 members of our management which could have an antitakeover effect the market price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly since our spinoff from ati and could continue to do so   since the spinoff on november 29 1999 the market price of our common stock has ranged from a low of 76875 to a high of 305625 per share at february 27 2004 our closing stock price was 2026 fluctuations in our stock price could continue among the factors that could affect our stock price are  21    the stock markets in general and the markets for high technology companies in particular have experienced a high degree of volatility not necessarily related to the operating performance of particular companies we cannot provide assurances as to our stock price while the company believes its control systems are effective there are inherent limitations in all control systems and misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected   the company continues to take action to assure compliance with the internal controls disclosure controls and other requirements of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer cannot guarantee that our internal controls and disclosure controls will prevent all possible errors or all fraud a control system no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met in addition the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefit of controls must be relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no system of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within the company have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake further controls can be circumvented by individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more persons or by management override of the controls the design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions over time a control may be inadequate because of changes in conditions or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate because of inherent limitations in a costeffective control system misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected 22 










 item 2 properties   our principal facilities as of december 28 2003 are listed below although the facilities vary in terms of age and condition our management believes that these facilities have generally been well maintained and are adequate for current operations in 2003 the company spent approximately 6 million to expand its companyowned rancho cordova california facility principally due to an increased demand for military traveling wave tubes  23    we also own or lease facilities elsewhere in the united states and outside the united states including tijuana mexico gloucester and west drayton england cumbernauld scotland and ottawa canada our corporate executive offices are located at 12333 west olympic boulevard los angeles california 900641021 


 item 3 legal proceedings   from time to time we become involved in various lawsuits claims and proceedings related to the conduct of our business including those pertaining to product liability patent infringement commercial employment and employee benefits while we cannot predict the outcome of any lawsuit claim or proceeding our management does not believe that the disposition of any pending matters is likely to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or liquidity the resolution in any reporting period of one or more of these matters however could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations for that period

 item 5 market for registrant’s common equity and related stockholder matters price range of common stock and dividend policy   our common stock is listed on the new york stock exchange and traded under the symbol “tdy” the following table sets forth for the periods indicated the high and low sale prices for the common stock as reported by the new york stock exchange    on february 27 2004 the closing sale price of our common stock as reported by the new york stock exchange was 2026 per share as of february 27 2004 there were approximately 7481 holders of record of the common stock   we currently intend to retain any future earnings to fund the development and growth of our business therefore we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future provisions of our credit agreement limit our ability to pay dividends to amounts exceeding 25 of cumulative net income subsequent to the effective date of the credit agreement as of december 28 2003 approximately 249 million was available for the payment of dividends under these provisions 


 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations   teledyne technologies incorporated is a leading provider of sophisticated electronic components instruments and communications products including defense electronics data acquisition and communications equipment for airlines and business aircraft monitoring and control instruments for industrial and environmental applications and components and subsystems for wireless and satellite communications we also provide systems engineering solutions and information technology services for space defense and industrial applications and manufacture general aviation and missile engines and components as well as onsite gas and power generation systems   we serve niche market segments where performance precision and reliability are critical our customers include major industrial and communications companies government agencies aerospace prime contractors and general aviation companies strategy   principally through focused acquisitions of complementary product lines and businesses we seek to build growth platforms around three core markets aerospace and defense electronics electronic instrumentation and government systems engineering we also intend to continue to focus on managing costs and operational excellence in every aspect of our business from finance to manufacturing as well as with the integration of our acquisitions we continually evaluate our product lines to ensure that they are aligned with our strategy recent acquisitions   after completing one acquisition in each of 2001 and 2002 we completed three acquisitions in calendar year 2003 and one in 2004 26   on may 16 2003 to expand further into the environmental instrumentation market we acquired mason ohiobased tekmar company from emerson electric co tekmar company now known as teledyne tekmar company is a premier manufacturer of gas chromatography introduction systems and automated total organic carbon analyzers   on june 27 2003 to enhance our aircraft data acquisition and communications product lines we acquired from spirent plc its aviation information solution businesses collectively “ais” which included spirent systems wichita inc spirent systems ottawa limited and assets of united kingdombased the flight data company limited these businesses design and manufacture aerospace data acquisition devices networking products and flight deck and cabin displays by yearend 2003 we consolidated the wichita kansas manufacturing operations with those of our existing los angeles california facility   on december 31 2003 to broaden our microwave product lines to our customers we acquired certain assets of the filtronic solid state business located in santa clara california solid state designs and manufactures customized microwave assemblies for electronic warfare radar and other military applications the business which now operates as “teledyne microwave” is being relocated and consolidated with our existing microwave subsystems operations in mountain view california   on february 27 2004 we acquired assets of leeman labs inc located in hudson new hampshire leeman lab’s inductively coupled plasma laboratory spectrometers are used by environmental and quality control laboratories to detect low levels of inorganic contaminants in water and other environmental samples and complement teledyne tekmar company’s organic analysis instrumentation   our acquisitions of monitor labs incorporated and advanced pollution instrumentation inc completed in 2002 and 2001 respectively greatly expanded our presence in the airquality monitoring segment of the environmental instrumentation market   all of the acquisitions are part of our electronics and communications segment their results are included in our consolidated financial statements since their respective dates of acquisition since the acquisition of certain assets of the filtronic solid state and leeman lab’s businesses occurred after teledyne technologies 2003 fiscal year these acquisitions are not reflected in the balance sheet or income statement at yearend 2003 27   our fiscal year is determined based on a 5352week convention and ends on or about december 31 the following is our financial information for 2003 2002 and 2001 in millions except pershare amounts    we operate in four business segments electronics and communications systems engineering solutions aerospace engines and components and energy systems the segments’ respective contributions as a percentage of total sales for 2003 2002 and 2001 are summarized in the following table  28 results of operations 

 

    we reported 2003 net sales of 8407 million compared with net sales of 7727 million for 2002 net income was 297 million 091 per diluted share for 2003 compared with 254 million 077 per diluted share for 2002   the increase in sales in 2003 compared with 2002 reflected improvement in all four reporting segments the largest sales growth was in the electronic and communications segment notwithstanding a difficult environment in some of the companies commercial markets the higher sales in the electronics and communications segment resulted from both organic growth and strategic acquisitions including monitor labs acquired in september 2002 tekmar company acquired in may 2003 and spirent’s aviation information solutions businesses acquired in june 2003   cost of sales in total dollars was higher in 2003 compared with 2002 the increase was in line with higher sales and also reflected higher pension expense partially offset by product mix differences cost of sales as a percentage of sales for 2003 was relatively flat compared with 2002 while the percentages were comparable the 2003 percentage reflected the impact of pension expense compared with pension income in 2002 the impact was offset in part by product mix differences and a more favorable lifo adjustment in 2003 total year 2003 also reflected an improvement in cost of sales as a percentage of sales due to finalization of award and incentive fee negotiations for work performed on certain contracts in prior years in the systems engineering solutions segment at december 29 2002 teledyne technologies recorded income of 01 million following the final resolution of the second quarter 2001 charge   selling general and administrative expenses including research and development and bid and proposal expense in total dollars were higher in 2003 compared with 2002 this increase was in line with higher sales which resulted from organic growth and acquisitions the increased bid and proposal expense was primarily driven by bidding opportunities in the systems engineering solutions segment selling general and administrative expenses for 2003 as a percentage of sales were relatively flat compared with 2002 reflecting the benefit of higher sales and continued cost control   included in operating profit in 2003 was pension expense of 69 million compared with pension income of 23 million in 2002 the increase in pension expense in 2003 compared with 2002 reflects in 29 part a reduction in the discount rate assumption for the company’s defined benefit plan as well as the decline in the market value of the company’s pension assets during 2002 2001 and 2000 

  the company’s effective tax rate for 2003 was 333 compared with 397 for 2002 total year 2003 reflected an income tax benefit of 24 million due to the reversal of an income tax contingency reserve which was determined to be no longer needed during the third quarter of 2003 excluding this benefit the company’s effective tax rate for 2003 would have been 387   sales under contracts with the us government were approximately 46 of sales in 2003 and 2002 international sales represented approximately 16 of sales in 2003 and 2002   total interest expense including facility fees and other bank charges was 10 million in 2003 and 09 million in 2002 interest income was 02 million in 2003 and 03 million in 2002   in 2003 we recorded a 23 million charge in other expense for the writeoff of the company’s remaining costbased investment in a private company engaged in manufacturing and development of micro optics and microelectromechanical devices in 2002 we recorded a 05 million charge in other expense related to the partial writedown of this investment fiscal years 2003 and 2002 also include sublease rental income and royalty income in other income 2002 compared with 2001    we reported 2002 net sales of 7727 million compared with net sales of 7443 million for 2001 net income was 254 million 077 per diluted share for 2002 compared with 66 million 020 per diluted share for 2001 net income from continuing operations was 254 million 077 per diluted share for 2002 compared with 68 million 021 per diluted share for 2001   the increase in sales in 2002 compared with 2001 reflected improvement in all four reporting segments the largest sales growth was in the electronic and communications segment which included the sales contributions from monitor labs and api which were acquired in september 2002 and november 2001 respectively 30   in the second quarter of 2001 the company recorded a 264 million pretax charge which is more fully described in the section below titled “2001 restructuring asset impairment and other charge information” this charge included plans to exit manufacturing for the following noncore product lines from its electronics and communications segment industrial solid state relays and certain microwave switches and filters the company’s process control software and sodium iodide crystals product lines within its systems engineering solutions segment were sold in the second quarter of 2001 we also exited certain environmental programs within this same segment annual sales for these noncore product lines were approximately 100 million in 2000 at december 29 2002 teledyne technologies recorded income of 01 million following the final resolution of the second quarter 2001 charge   cost of sales as a percentage of sales for 2002 was lower compared with 2001 due to the benefit of cost reductions implemented in 2001 and 2002 and not having the inventory writedown in 2002 that was experienced in 2001 recorded in connection with the 2001 second quarter charge this was partially offset by product mix differences a less favorable lifo adjustment and reduced pension income   selling general and administrative expenses for 2002 were higher in total dollars than in 2001 but lower as a percent of sales the increase in expense was driven by higher charges related to aircraft product liability reserves and higher aircraft liability insurance premiums additional selling general and administrative expenses for the api acquisition and the monitor labs acquisition partially offset by cost reductions and lower research and development expenditures   sales under contracts with the us government were approximately 46 of sales for 2002 and 45 of sales for 2001 international sales represented approximately 16 of sales for 2002 and 17 of sales in 2001   fiscal year 2001 included 264 million in pretax charge noted above included in operating profit was pension income of 23 million in 2002 and 95 million in 2001 the reduction in net pension income from 2001 to 2002 reflects the completion in 2001 of income amortization associated with the transition assets recorded pursuant to financial accounting standards board “fasb” statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 87—“employers’ accounting for pensions” as well as the decline in the market value of the company’s pension assets during 2002 2001 and 2000   total interest expense was 09 million in 2002 and 21 million in 2001 the decrease in interest expense in 2002 compared with 2001 primarily reflected lower average outstanding debt levels in 2002 as well as lower average interest rates interest income was 03 million in 2002 and 02 million in 2001   in 2002 we recorded a 05 million charge in other expense related to the partial writedown of the company’s costbased investment in a private company engaged in manufacturing and development of micro optics and microelectromechanical devices in 2001 other income reflects a gain of 17 million related to sale of the company’s share of an optical components company fiscal years 2002 and 2001 also include sublease rental income and royalty income in other income   in june 2001 the fasb issued sfas no 142 — “goodwill and other intangible assets” “sfas no 142” which changed the accounting for goodwill in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 142 goodwill is no longer amortized but must be reviewed for impairment had the goodwill nonamortization provisions of sfas no 142 been in effect for 2001 net income would have been 70 million for 2001 basic earnings per share and diluted earnings per share would have been 022 for 2001   the company’s effective tax rate was 397 for 2002 and 2001 2001 restructuring asset impairment and other charge information   in the second quarter of 2001 the company recorded a 264 million pretax charge of which 74 million was for asset impairments 87 million was for restructuring and other charges 100 million was for inventory writedowns and a 03 million pretax charge for discontinued operations 31   the second quarter 2001 charge also included restructuring charges for employee termination benefits the consolidation and downsizing of manufacturing operations noncancelable lease expenses and transaction costs associated with the formation of teledyne energy systems inc teledyne technologies reduced its total workforce by approximately 14 during 2001 the company recorded asset impairment charges for equipment net of expected sale proceeds goodwill related to product lines to be discontinued and losses on the sale of noncore product lines we exited manufacturing for the following noncore product lines from our electronics and communications segment industrial solid state relays and certain microwave switches and filters the company’s process control software and sodium iodide crystals product lines within its systems engineering solutions segment were sold in the second quarter of 2001 we also exited certain environmental programs within this same segment annual sales for these noncore product lines were approximately 100 million in 2000 a charge was also recorded in cost of sales for the writeoff of inventory from discontinued product lines and the writedown of excess inventory resulting from reduced customer demand   during 2002 the company completed the efforts related to the 2001 second quarter charge of 264 million recording actual charges of 263 million at yearend 2002 the cumulative restructuring charges were 81 million 07 million lower than the 2001 yearend estimate at yearend 2002 the cumulative charges to cost of sales related to excess and obsolete inventory were 104 million 06 million higher than the 2001 yearendestimate with no change to either the asset impairment charge or the charge for discontinued operations this resulted in 02 million of income in the electronics and communications segment in 2002 and an additional cost impact of 01 million in the systems engineering segment during 2002 in addition there were some changes in income statement classification final charges by segment were as follows 154 million in the electronics and communication segment 56 million in the energy systems segment 45 million in the systems engineering solutions segment and 03 million in the aerospace engines and components segment the 263 million charge also included a 02 million restructuring charge for the corporate office and a charge of 03 million for discontinued operations the following table details the components of the 2001 second quarter charge and the final resolution of the changes in estimate at december 29 2002 and december 30 2001 amounts in millions  32   the following table details the original 2001 second quarter charge by segment and the final resolution of the changes in estimate at december 29 2002 and december 30 2001 amounts in millions  segments   the following discussion of our four segments should be read in conjunction with note 14 to the notes to consolidated financial statements electronics and communications    our electronics and communications segment provides a wide range of specialized electronic systems instruments components and services that address niche market applications in commercial aerospace communications defense industrial and medical markets   2003 compared with 2002   our electronics and communications segment sales were 4469 million in 2003 compared with sales of 3880 million in 2002 operating profit was 330 million in 2003 compared with 359 million in 2002   sales in 2003 compared with 2002 reflected revenue growth in defense electronic products electronic manufacturing services avionics products electronic instruments medical products and commercial lighting products the revenue growth in defense electronic products was driven by traveling wave tubes and military microelectronics the revenue growth in electronic manufacturing services was driven by increased sales to military customers revenue growth in avionics products was driven by the acquisition of the aviation information solutions businesses in june 2003 partially offset by continued weakness in the commercial aviation market electronic instruments’ revenue was favorably impacted by the acquisition of monitor labs incorporated at the end of the third quarter of 2002 and the acquisition of tekmardohrmann in may 2003 this revenue growth in electronic instruments was partially offset by reduced sales of geophysical sensors for the petroleum exploration market operating profit was favorably impacted by increased sales and a 18 million reduction in lifo reserve which resulted from a reduced inventory level these operating profit improvements were more than offset by a 09 million fourth quarter writedown on slow moving test equipment inventory contract settlements totaling 08 million and higher pension expense in 2002 the company recorded a 08 million writedown of certain 33 optoelectronics equipment due to lower than expected utilization segment operating profit in 2003 included 51 million of pension expense compared with 20 million of pension income in 2002 

  2002 compared with 2001   our electronics and communications segment sales were 3880 million in 2002 compared with sales of 3697 million in 2001 operating profit was 359 million in 2002 compared with 99 million in 2001 operating profit for 2002 included 02 million of income resulting from the final resolution of the previously cited second quarter 2001 charges operating profit for 2001 included second quarter pretax charges of 156 million described below   sales in 2002 compared with 2001 grew in electronic manufacturing services electronic instruments and defense electronic products the sales growth in electronic manufacturing services was primarily driven by increased sales from medical and military markets the sales growth in electronic instruments resulted from the acquisitions of monitor labs in september 2002 and api in november 2001 as well as stronger demand for geophysical sensors for the petroleum exploration market these sales increases were partially offset by continued weakness in the commercial aviation market and the continued weakness in the demand for relays used in semiconductor test equipment and communications applications operating profit reflects the impact of the sales differences a reduction in the segment’s commercial broadband communications investments savings from a reduced workforce and decreased administrative expenses compared with 2001 these operating profit improvements were partially offset by the 08 million writedown of certain optoelectronic equipment and reduced pension income of 49 million systems engineering solutions    our systems engineering solutions segment principally through teledyne brown engineering inc applies the skills of its extensive staff of engineers and scientists to provide innovative systems engineering advanced technology and manufacturing solutions to defense space environmental and homeland security requirements   2003 compared with 2002   our systems engineering solutions segment sales were 2125 million in 2003 compared with sales of 2067 million in 2002 operating profit was 232 million in 2003 compared with 206 million in 2002   sales in 2003 compared with 2002 reflected increased work in environmental and core defense programs partially offset by lower sales in aerospace programs operating profit in 2003 compared with 2002 was favorably impacted by increased sales and 41 million related to both the finalization of negotiation of prior year award and incentive fees for work performed on certain contracts primarily the groundbased midcourse defense and pressurents propellants and calibration contracts operating profit in 2003 also reflected improved margins for environmental programs operating profit in 2003 was negatively impacted by the recognition of a 10 million loss on an office sublease agreement segment operating profit in 2003 included 03 million of pension expense compared with 02 million of pension income in 2002 34   2002 compared with 2001   our systems engineering solutions segment sales were 2067 million in 2002 compared with sales of 2008 million in 2001 operating profit was 206 million in 2002 compared with 121 million in 2001 operating profit in 2002 included 01 million of expense resulting from the final resolution of the previously cited second quarter 2001 charges operating profit in 2001 included pretax charges of 44 million described below   sales in 2002 compared with 2001 reflected revenue growth in core defense and aerospace programs this growth was partially offset by reduced work for environmental programs operating profit reflects the impact of the sales differences the receipt of government award and incentive fees based upon collective performance achievements improved performance on environmental programs and reduced administrative expenses these operating profit improvements were partially offset by reduced pension income of 07 million aerospace engines and components    our aerospace engines and components segment principally through teledyne continental motors inc focuses on the design development and manufacture of piston engines turbine engines electronic engine controls and aviation batteries   2003 compared with 2002   our aerospace engines and components segment sales were 1655 million in 2003 compared with sales of 1629 million in 2002 operating profit was 64 million in 2003 compared with 27 million in 2002   sales in 2003 compared with 2002 reflected revenue growth in oem piston engines partially offset by reduced sales of aftermarket products and services operating profit in the piston engine business was positively impacted by an improved cost structure productivity improvements and a 33 million reduction in lifo reserve which resulted from a reduced inventory level partially offset by an increase in insurance costs sales from turbine engines were unfavorably impacted by lower revenue from spare parts for air force training aircraft and lower harpoon cruise missile engine sales partially offset by higher revenue from improved tactical airlaunched decoy “itald” engines and favorable joint airtosurface standoff missile “jassm” engine sales operating profit for turbine engines was lower in 2003 compared with 2002 and resulted from lower sales and a less favorable product mix segment operating profit in 2003 included 13 million of pension expense compared with 05 million of pension income in 2002   2002 compared with 2001   our aerospace engines and components segment sales were 1629 million in 2002 compared with sales of 1592 million in 2001 operating profit was 27 million in 2002 compared with 82 million in 2001   sales in 2002 compared with 2001 reflected revenue growth in oem piston engines and aftermarket parts and services partially offset by reduced sales of military turbine engines operating profit in 2002 was 35 negatively impacted by the requirement for higher aircraft liability reserves increased insurance premiums and crankshaft litigation costs net of settlement awards operating profit was also negatively impacted by a less favorable lifo adjustment due to the fact that the 2002 inventory reduction was not as significant as the 2001 inventory reduction furthermore operating profit was negatively impacted in 2002 by a 14 million reduction in pension income operating profit in 2001 included restructuring charges of 03 million 

  in 2002 we reached a monetary settlement with two of the three companies that manufactured and processed allegedly defective steel subsequently made into aircraft engine crankshafts we failed to win a jury verdict against the third company involved in making the steel the company continues to pursue cost recovery through litigation against another materials supplier as a result of the 2000 product recall program energy systems    our energy systems segment through teledyne energy systems inc provides onsite gas and power generation systems based on proprietary electrolysis thermoelectric and fuel cell technologies   2003 compared with 2002   our energy systems sales were 158 million in 2003 compared with sales of 151 million in 2002 the 2003 operating loss was 07 million compared with a 2002 operating loss of 19 million   sales in 2003 reflected revenue growth in government programs related to multiyear contracts which were won in 2003 primarily for thermoelectric generator development partially offset by reduction in commercial revenue primarily hydrogen generator sales the reduction in operating loss for 2003 compared with 2002 resulted from increased sales an improved overhead cost structure reduced general and administrative and research and development expenses and the absence of 03 million in program cost adjustments that impacted 2002 partially offset by 04 million in charges for contract claims and the recognition of a 05 million loss on a facility sublease agreement   2002 compared with 2001   our energy systems sales were 151 million in 2002 compared with sales of 146 million in 2001 the 2002 operating loss was 19 million compared with a 2001 operating loss of 60 million the 2001 results included pretax charges of 56 million described below   sales in 2002 compared with 2001 grew in government program sales the 2002 higher operating loss excluding the 2001 pretax charges was driven by higher research and development expense higher general and administrative expense and higher than anticipated costs for certain hydrogen generator programs additionally segment operating loss was negatively impacted by a 02 million reduction in pension income 36 financial condition liquidity and capital resources principal capital requirements   our principal capital requirements are to fund working capital needs capital expenditures and debt service requirements as well as to fund acquisitions it is anticipated that operating cash flow together with available borrowings under the credit facility described below will be sufficient to meet these requirements and could be used to fund some acquisitions in the year 2004 to support acquisitions we may need to raise additional capital our liquidity is not dependent upon the use of offbalance sheet financial arrangements we have no offbalance sheet financing arrangements that incorporate the use of special purpose entities or unconsolidated entities revolving credit agreement   the company’s current 200 million revolving credit agreement terminates in november 2004 we are currently in the process of replacing this agreement we expect to have a replacement revolving credit agreement in place before november 2004 for a description of some terms of our existing credit facility see “financing activities” at page 40 contractual obligations   information on the company’s known contractual obligations to third parties at december 28 2003 are as follows in millions   operating activities   in 2003 cash provided from continuing operations was 568 million compared with 742 million in 2002 and 190 million in 2001 the lower net cash provided from continuing operations for 2003 compared with 2002 reflected timing differences related to accounts payable differences in the cash impact of income taxes higher payments in 2003 for aircraft product liability settlements and higher accounts receivables balances the higher accounts receivables balances reflected the impact of higher sales in december 2003 compared to december 2002 in 2003 cash was used to pay down accounts payable compared to an increase in accounts payable for 2002 resulting primarily from timing of inventory and capital purchases the deferred income tax and the accrued pension obligation components of the cash flow statement in 2003 were both affected by the deferred tax amount of 76 million related to the minimum pension liability adjustment recorded in 2003 this adjustment had no impact on cash flows from operations in 2003   the improvement in cash flow in 2002 compared with 2001 reflected higher net income from continuing operations in 2002 and significantly lower cash payouts for aircraft product liability settlements and product recall payments by 190 million the 2002 cash flow amount also reflected improved working capital management the improvement in cash flow reflected the impact of 58 million for income tax refunds net of cash payments in 2002 compared with net cash payments for income taxes of 46 million in 2001 which included the final required tax payment for the twelve months of 2000 the deferred income tax and the accrued pension obligation components of the cash flow statement in 2002 both were affected by the deferred tax amount of 152 million related to the minimum pension liability adjustment recorded in 2002 resulting in no impact on cash flow from operations in 2002 37   the 2002 and 2001 cash used by discontinued operations each reflected the payment of a purchase price adjustment fiscal years 2003 2002 and 2001 reflected workers’ compensation insurance payments working capital   working capital increased to 1295 million at yearend 2003 compared with 1026 million at yearend 2002 the increase in working capital was due to higher cash balances and higher accounts receivable driven by higher sales in december 2003 compared to december 2002 these increases were offset in part by higher accrued liabilities primarily driven by acquisitions we continue to emphasize improvements in working capital management balance sheet changes   the changes in the following selected components of teledyne technologies balance sheet are discussed below in millions    the higher balance in cash and cash equivalents at december 28 2003 compared with december 29 2002 reflected positive cash flow from operations reduced by capital spending and cash used to acquire businesses the higher balance in accounts receivables reflected trade receivables for businesses acquired in 2003 as well as the impact of higher sales in december 2003 compared to december 2002 the decrease in longterm deferred income taxes reflected the 76 million reduction recorded in connection with an 114 million noncash adjustment to prior year accumulated other comprehensive loss for the company’s pension plan the adjustment to the accumulated other comprehensive loss component of equity was required since the difference between the value of the company’s pension assets and the accumulated pension benefit obligation was smaller as of yearend 2003 compared to yearend 2002 the charge to equity did not affect net income and was recorded net of deferred taxes goodwill reflects the impact of acquisitions made in 2003 the change in other assets reflects 54 million of intangible assets acquired as part of the acquisitions of tekmar company and ais partially offset by the writeoff of the company’s costbased investment in a private company engaged in manufacturing and development of micro optics and microelectromechanical devices in addition the decrease in other assets reflects a 19 million adjustment to the longterm intangible pension asset recorded in connection with the yearend adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive loss the increase in shortterm accrued liabilities reflected liabilities for businesses acquired in 2003 and higher customer deposits the accrued pension obligation decreased primarily as a result of favorable returns on plan assets in 2003 the change in the accumulated other comprehensive loss reflected the 114 million noncash adjustment for the company’s pension plan 38 investing activities   net cash used in investing activities included capital expenditures as presented below capital expenditures    during 2004 we plan to invest approximately 210 million in capital principally to reduce manufacturing costs to introduce new products and to upgrade capital equipment commitments at december 28 2003 for capital expenditures were approximately 24 million   investing activities in 2003 included the acquisitions of ais and tekmar company on june 27 2003 teledyne technologies acquired ais for 64 million in cash which is net of a 04 million purchase price adjustment ais had sales of approximately 168 million for the fiscal year ended december 2002 on may 16 2003 teledyne technologies acquired tekmar company for 135 million in cash tekmar

pennsylvania monitor labs had sales of approximately 256 million for the twelve months ended september 29 2002 investing activities in 2002 also included the receipt of a tax refund of 11 million related to the api acquisition   investing activity in 2001 reflected the acquisition of san diego californiabased api for 250 million api is a designer and manufacturer of advanced air quality monitoring instruments api had sales of approximately 163 million for the twelve months ended september 30 2001 in 2001 teledyne technologies also invested 25 million in a manufacturer of micro lenses for optical data recording and optical communications   in all acquisitions the results are included in the company’s consolidated financial statements from the date of each respective acquisition the company accounts for goodwill and purchased intangible assets under sfas no 141 “business combinations” and sfas no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” business acquisitions are accounted for under the purchase method by assigning the purchase price to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at their fair values and the excess of the purchase price over the amounts assigned is recorded as goodwill assets acquired and liabilities assumed are allocated to the company’s “reporting units” based on the company’s integration plans and internal reporting structure purchased intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but reviewed at least annually for impairment the acquisitions of tekmar company and ais resulted in 54 million of purchased intangible assets primarily trade names customer relationships software technology and patents of the 54 million of intangible assets 36 million is subject to amortization over estimated useful lives ranging from five to 20 years and a weighted average life of 8 years the company recorded 02 million in amortization expense in 2003 for these intangible assets in 2003 teledyne technologies completed the required impairment tests of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets and has determined that no impairment charge is required the allocation of the purchase price for the acquisition of tekmar company was completed as of yearend 39 2003 the allocation of the purchase price for the acquisition of ais is preliminary and is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2004 

  in july 2001 teledyne technologies combined its energy systems business unit with assets of floridabased energy partners inc to create majorityowned 86 teledyne energy systems inc   on december 31 2003 teledyne’s 2004 fiscal year teledyne acquired certain assets of the filtronic solid state “solid state” business from filtronic plc for 120 million in cash solid state designs and manufactures customized microwave subassemblies for electronic warfare radar and other military applications the business which will operate as teledyne wireless inc will be relocated from santa clara california

february 27 2004 the transaction is subject to customary closing conditions leeman labs’ product lines would augment teledyne’s existing laboratory and continuous monitoring instruments used in environmental applications leeman lab’s inductively coupled plasma laboratory spectrometers are used by environmental and quality control laboratories to detect low levels of inorganic contaminants in water and other environmental samples and complement teledyne tekmar’s organic analysis instrumentation leeman labs located in hudson new hampshire had sales of approximately 86 million for its fiscal year ended september 30 2003 financing activities   cash used in financing activities for fiscal years 2003 2002 and 2001 reflect proceeds from the exercise of stock options cash used in financing activities for 2002 also reflected the payment of longterm debt cash provided by financing activities for 2001 also reflected borrowings under a revolving credit agreement   a 200 million fiveyear revolving credit agreement that terminates in november 2004 was arranged with a syndicate of banks in connection with the spinoff ati drew 100 million under the facility prior to our assumption of the facility teledyne technologies assumed the repayment obligation for the amount drawn by ati at december 28 2003 and december 29 2002 we had no longterm debt outstanding excluding interest and fees no payments are due under the credit facility until the facility terminates   at yearend 2003 we had 200 million of available committed credit under the credit facility which can be utilized as needed for daily operating and periodic cash needs including acquisitions borrowings under the credit facility bear interest at our option at a rate based on either a defined base rate or the london interbank offered rate libor plus applicable margins the credit agreement also provides for facility fees that vary between 035 and 020 of the credit line depending on our capitalization ratio as calculated from time to time this credit facility requires the company to comply with various financial covenants and restrictions including covenants and restrictions relating to indebtedness liens investments dividend payments consolidated net worth interest coverage and the ratio of total consolidated indebtedness to earnings before interest taxes and depreciation and amortization the credit agreement prohibits stock repurchases the declaration of dividends or making other specified distributions in amounts exceeding 25 of cumulative net income after the effective date of the credit agreement 249 million at december 28 2003 we also have available 142 million under two uncommitted bank facilities with no outstanding amounts at yearend 2003 or 2002 these credit lines are utilized as needed for periodic cash needs   in march 2003 teledyne technologies announced that its board of directors authorized the company to purchase from time to time up to one million shares of its common stock in open market or privately negotiated transactions through march 31 2004 no repurchases have been made to date 40 pension plans   in connection with the spinoff a defined benefit pension plan was established and teledyne technologies assumed the existing pension obligations for all of the employees both active and inactive at the operations which perform government contract work and for active employees at operations which do not perform government contract work ati transferred pension assets to fund the new defined benefit pension plan the company has changed its retirement benefits for nonunion new hires as of january 1 2004 nonunion new hires will be eligible to participate in an enhanced defined contribution plan as opposed to the company’s existing defined benefit plan currently teledyne technologies anticipates making an aftertax cash contribution of approximately 40 million to its pension plan in 2004 also under one of its spinoff agreements after november 29 2004 the company will be able to charge pension costs to the us government under various government contracts   sfas no 87 “employers’ accounting for pensions” requires that a minimum pension liability be recorded if the value of pension assets is less than the accumulated pension benefit obligation since this condition existed as of yearend 2002 the company recorded a 232 million noncash charge to stockholders’ equity a longterm intangible asset of 104 million and an additional longterm pension liability of 488 million as of yearend 2003 the difference between the value of the company’s pension assets and the accumulated pension benefit obligation decreased from yearend 2002 this decrease resulted in an 114 million reduction to the noncash charge to accumulated other comprehensive loss as of yearend 2003 the noncash charge to stockholders’ equity was 118 million the adjustments to equity in 2003 and 2002 did not affect net income and is recorded net of deferred taxes the charge will be reversed should the value of the pension assets exceed the accumulated pension benefit obligation as of a future measurement date see note 13 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional pension disclosures tax sharing and indemnification agreement   the tax sharing and indemnification agreement between ati and teledyne technologies provides that we will indemnify ati and its agents or representatives for taxes imposed on and other amounts paid by them or ati’s stockholders if we take actions or fail to take actions that result in the spinoff not qualifying as a taxfree distribution if any of the taxes or other amounts described above were to become payable by teledyne technologies the payment could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flow and could exceed our net worth by a substantial amount the company believes that it has satisfied its principal spinoff requirements when it completed its 2000 public offering and used the proceeds for research and development and related capital projects for the further development of manufacturing capabilities and for acquisitions andor joint ventures other matters income taxes   as noted earlier the company’s effective tax rate for 2003 was 333 compared with 397 for 2002 and 2001 total year 2003 reflected an income tax benefit of 24 million due to the reversal of an income tax contingency reserve which was determined to be no longer needed during the third quarter of 2003 excluding this benefit the company’s effective tax rate for 2003 would have been 387 based on the company’s history of operating earnings expectations of future operating earnings and potential tax planning strategies it is more likely than not that the deferred income tax assets at december 28 2003 will be realized costs and pricing   inflationary trends in recent years have been moderate we primarily use the lastin firstout method of inventory accounting that reflects current costs in the costs of products sold these costs the increasing costs of equipment and other costs are considered in establishing sales pricing polices the company emphasizes cost containment in all aspects of its business 41 hedging activities market risk disclosures   we have not utilized derivative financial instruments such as futures contracts options and swaps forward foreign exchange contracts or interest rate swaps and futures during 2003 and 2002 we believe that adequate controls are in place to monitor any hedging activities our primary exposure to market risk relates to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates we periodically evaluate these risks and have taken measures to mitigate these risks we own assets and operate facilities in countries that have been politically stable also our foreign risk management objectives are geared towards stabilizing cash flow from the effects of foreign currency fluctuations most of the company’s sales are denominated in us dollars which mitigates the effect of exchange rate changes any borrowings under the company’s revolving credit line are based on a fluctuating market interest rate and consequently the fair value of any outstanding debt should not be affected materially by changes in market interest rates overall we believe that our exposure to interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange rate changes is not material to our financial condition or results of operations related party transactions   in connection with the spinoff teledyne technologies and ati entered into several agreements governing the separation of our businesses and various employee benefits compensation tax indemnification and transition arrangements the company’s principal spinoff requirements to ensure a favorable tax treatment have been satisfied we successfully completed our required public offering in august 2000 and used the offering proceeds in accordance with ati’s tax ruling as amended since august 2002 the second anniversary of our 2000 public offering we no longer need ati’s consent to make stock repurchases the requirement that at least a majority of our directors be members of the board of directors of ati expired at our 2002 annual meeting of stockholders four of our nine directors continue to serve on ati’s board in addition under one of our spinoff agreements the earliest the company will be able to charge pension costs to the u s government under various government contracts will be november 29 2004 we also license the “teledyne” name and related logos symbols and marks from an affiliate of ati   our chairman president and chief executive officer is a director of mellon financial corporation another of our directors is a former chief executive officer and director of mellon financial corporation all transactions with mellon bank na and its affiliates are effected under normal commercial terms and we believe that our relationships with mellon bank na and its affiliates are armslength mellon bank na is one of nine lenders under our 200 million credit facility having committed up to 33750000 under the facility it also provides cash management services and an uncommitted 50 million line of credit mellon bank na serves as trustee under our pension plan and provides asset management services for the plan mellon investor services llc serves as our transfer agent and registrar as well as agent under our stockholders rights plan environmental   we are subject to various federal state local and international environmental laws and regulations which require that we investigate and remediate the effects of the release or disposal of materials at sites associated with past and present operations these include sites at which teledyne technologies has been identified as a potentially responsible party under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act commonly known as superfund and comparable state laws we are currently involved in the investigation and remediation of a number of sites reserves for environmental investigation and remediation totaled approximately 20 million at december 28 2003 as investigation and remediation of these sites proceed and new information is received the company expects that accruals will be adjusted to reflect new information based on current information we do not believe that future environmental costs in excess of those already accrued will materially and adversely affect our financial condition or liquidity however resolution of one or more of these environmental matters or future accrual adjustments in any one reporting period could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations for that period 42   with respect to proceedings brought under the federal superfund laws or similar state statutes the company has been identified as a potentially responsible party at approximately 17 such sites excluding those sites at which teledyne technologies believes it has no future liability our involvement is very limited or de minimis at approximately nine of these sites and the potential loss exposure with respect to any of the remaining eight sites is not considered to be material   for additional discussion of environmental matters see notes 2 and 15 to the notes to consolidated financial statements government contracts   we perform work on a number of contracts with the department of defense and other agencies and departments of the us government sales under contracts with the us government which included contracts with the department of defense were approximately 46 of total sales in 2003 and in 2002 and 45 of total sales in 2001 for a summary of sales to the us government by segment see note 14 to the notes to consolidated financial statements sales to the department of defense represented approximately 31 30 and 30 of total sales for 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively   performance under government contracts has certain inherent risks that could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business results of operations and financial condition government contracts are conditioned upon the continuing availability of congressional appropriations which usually occurs on a fiscal year basis even though contract performance may take more than one year while the overall us military budget declined in real dollars from the mid1980s through the early 1990s us defense spending has increased and is expected to continue to increase over the next few years as a result of global responses to terrorism and perceived nuclear threats notwithstanding the potential for increased defense spending delays or declines in us military expenditures in the programs in which we participate could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition   for information on accounts receivable from the us government see note 6 to the notes to consolidated financial statements estimates and reserves   our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent liabilities on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including those related to product returns allowance for doubtful accounts inventories investments intangible assets income taxes warranty obligations pension and other postretirement benefits environmental and other contingencies and litigation we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances at the time the results of which form the basis for making our judgments actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions in some cases such differences may be material see “other matters — critical accounting policies” 43   the following table reflects significant reserves and valuation accounts which are estimates and based on judgments as described above at december 28 2003 and december 29 2002 reserves and valuation accountsa   critical accounting policies   our critical accounting policies are those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties and may potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions we have identified the following as critical accounting policies revenue recognition impairment of longlived assets income taxes inventories and related allowance for obsolete and excess inventory aircraft product liability reserve and accounting for pension plans for additional discussion of the application of these and other accounting policies see note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements   revenue recognition   commercial sales and revenue from us government fixedpricetype contracts are generally recorded as shipments are made or as services are rendered occasionally for certain fixedprice type contracts that require substantial performance over a long time period one or more years before shipments begin in accordance with the requirements of statement of position 811 “accounting for performance of constructiontype and certain productiontype contracts” revenues may be recorded based upon attainment of scheduled performance milestones which could be time event or expense driven in these few instances invoices are submitted to the customer under a contractual agreement and payments are made by the customer sales under costreimbursement contracts are recorded as costs are incurred and fees are earned since certain contracts extend over a long period of time all revisions in cost and funding estimates during the progress of work have the effect of adjusting the current period earnings on a cumulative catchup basis if the current contract estimate indicates a loss provision is made for the total anticipated loss   some of the company’s products are subject to specified warranties the company maintains a reserve for the estimated future costs of repair replacement or customer accommodation and periodically reviews this reserve for adequacy such review would generally include a review of historic warranty experience with respect to the applicable business or products as well as the length and actual terms of the warranties changes in the company’s product warranty reserve during 2003 are as follows in millions  44   the company follows the requirements of securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 104 on revenue recognition   impairments of longlived assets   we monitor the recoverability of the carrying value of our longlived assets an impairment charge is recognized when events and circumstances indicate that the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by an asset including any proceeds from dispositions are less than the carrying value of the asset and the asset’s carrying value is less than its fair value our cash flow estimates are based on historical results adjusted to reflect our best estimate of future market and operating conditions the net carrying value of assets not recoverable is reduced to fair value our estimates of fair value represent our best estimate based on industry trends and reference to market rates and transactions as a result of a review in the second quarter of 2001 we determined that the carrying amounts of certain of our longlived assets were no longer recoverable based on estimates of future operating cash flows to be generated by these assets as a result we recognized an impairment charge of approximately 75 million in 2001 in 2002 we recorded a 08 million writedown of certain optoelectronic equipment and a 05 million charge related to the partial writedown of the company’s 28 million costbased investment in a private company engaged in manufacturing and development of micro optics and microelectromechanical devices in 2003 we wroteoff the remaining 23 million of this investment   accounting for income taxes   as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate this process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which are included within our consolidated balance sheet we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income recognizing that future taxable income may give rise to new deferred tax assets to the extent that we believe that future recovery is not likely we must establish a valuation allowance to the extent we establish or increase a valuation allowance we must include an expense within the tax provision in the income statement   significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets a valuation allowance of 06 million was recorded as of december 28 2003 in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods we may need to adjust the valuation allowance which could impact our financial position and results of operations   provisions for income taxes for 2003 2002 and 2001 are based on numerous factors that are subject to audit by the internal revenue service and the tax authorities in the various jurisdictions in which we do business   inventories and related allowance for obsolete and excess inventory   inventories are valued at the lower of cost lastin firstout firstin firstout and average cost methods or market less progress payments we primarily use the lastin firstout method of inventory accounting that reflects current costs in the costs of products sold costs include direct material direct labor applicable manufacturing and engineering overhead and other direct costs inventories have been reduced by an allowance for excess and obsolete inventories the estimated allowance is based on management’s review of inventories on hand compared to assumptions about future demand and market conditions if actual future demand or market conditions are more or less favorable than those currently projected by management adjustments may be required we recorded a charge of 98 million in 2001 for the writeoff of inventory from discontinued product lines and the writedown of excess inventory resulting from reduced customer demand this charge was increased by 06 million in 2002 following the final 45 resolution of the second quarter 2001 charge in 2003 we recorded a 09 million fourth quarter writedown on slow moving test equipment inventory in our electronics and communication segment 

  aircraft product liability reserve   we are currently involved in certain legal proceedings related to aircraft product liability claims we have accrued an estimate of the probable costs for the resolution of these claims this estimate has been developed in consultation with our insurers outside counsel handling our defense in these matters and historical experience and is based upon an analysis of potential results assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies we do not believe these proceedings will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position it is possible however that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by specific events occurring in the period changes in our assumptions or the effectiveness of our strategies related to these proceedings while we have aircraft and product liability insurance our annual selfinsured retention for general aviation aircraft liabilities incurred in connection with products manufactured by teledyne continental motors is 150 million we cannot assure that for 2004 and in future years our ability to obtain insurance or the premiums for such insurance or the amount of our selfinsured retention or reserves will not be negatively impacted by our experience in prior years or other factors our current aircraft product liability insurance policy expires may 2004   accounting for pension plans   teledyne technologies has a defined benefit pension plan covering substantially all of its employees the company accounts for its defined benefit pension plan in accordance with sfas no 87 — “employers’ accounting for pensions” which requires that amounts recognized in financial statements be determined on an actuarial basis rather than as contributions are made to the plan a significant element in determining the company’s pension income or expense in accordance with sfas no 87 is the expected return on plan assets the company has assumed based upon the types of securities the plan assets are invested in and the longterm historical returns of these investments that the longterm expected return on pension assets will be 85 in 2004 compared with 85 in 2003 and its assumed discount rate will be 65 in 2004 compared with 70 in 2003 the company did not make a cash contribution to its pension plan in 2003 but anticipates making an aftertax cash contribution of approximately 40 million to its pension plan in 2004 the assumed longterm rate of return on assets is applied to the marketrelated value of plan assets at the end of the previous year this produces the expected return on plan assets that is included in annual pension income or expense for the current year the cumulative difference between this expected return and the actual return on plan assets is deferred and amortized into pension income or expense over future periods as noted above since the value of the company’s pension assets at yearend 2002 were less than the accumulated pension benefit obligation the company recorded a 232 million noncash charge to stockholders’ equity a longterm intangible asset of 104 million and an additional longterm pension liability of 488 million as of yearend 2003 the difference between the value of the company’s pension assets and the accumulated pension benefit obligation decreased from yearend 2002 this decrease resulted in an 114 million reduction to the noncash charge to accumulated other comprehensive loss as of yearend 2003 the noncash charge to stockholders’ equity was 118 million the adjustments to equity in 2003 and 2002 did not affect net income and were recorded net of deferred taxes the charge will be reversed should the value of the pension assets exceed the accumulated pension benefit obligation as of a future measurement date see note 13 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional pension disclosures recent accounting pronouncements   sfas no 132   in december 2003 the fasb issued sfas no 132 “employers’ disclosures about pensions and other postretirement benefits” “sfas no 132” sfas no 132 requires additional information regarding the types of plan assets investment strategy measurement date plan obligations cash flows and 46 components of net periodic benefit cost recognized during interim periods as is effective immediately upon issuance the company has included the required disclosures in note 13 to the notes to consolidated financial statements 

  sfas no 150   in may 2003 the fasb issued sfas no 150 “accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity” “sfas no 150” this statement establishes standards for classifying and measuring as liabilities certain financial instruments that embody obligations of the issuer and have characteristics of both liabilities and equity it represents a significant change in practice in the accounting for a number of financial instruments including mandatorily redeemable equity instruments and certain equity derivatives that frequently are used in connection with share repurchase programs sfas no 150 must be applied immediately to instruments entered into or modified after may 31 2003 and to all other instruments that exist as of the beginning of the first interim financial reporting period beginning after june 15 2003 except for noncontrolling interests of a limitedlife subsidiary which has been deferred indefinitely as teledyne technologies currently has no financial instruments that would be subject to sfas no 150 the adoption had no impact on the company   sfas no 149   in april 2003 the fasb issued sfas no 149 “amendment of statement 133 on derivative instruments and hedging activities” “sfas no 149” sfas no 149 amends and clarifies accounting for derivative instruments including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts and for hedging activities under sfas no 133 sfas no 149 clarifies under what circumstances a contract with an initial net investment meets the characteristics of a derivative and when a derivative contains a financing component that warrants special reporting in the statement of cash flows sfas no 149 is generally effective for contracts entered into or modified after june 30 2003 and had no impact on teledyne technologies’ financial position or results of operations   fin 46   in january 2003 the fasb issued interpretation no 46 “consolidation of variable interest entities” “fin 46” fin 46 requires companies to evaluate variable interest entities to determine whether to apply the consolidation provisions of fin 46 to those entities companies must apply fin 46 to entities created after january 31 2003 and to variable interest entities in which a company obtains an interest after that date in october 2003 the fasb deferred the effective date to the first fiscal year or interim period ending after december 15 2003 to variable interest entities in which a company holds a variable interest that is acquired before february 1 2003 teledyne technologies’ adoption of fin 46 will have no impact on the company’s consolidated results of operations or financial position   sfas no 143   in june 2001 the fasb issued sfas no 143 “accounting for asset retirement obligations” which addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible longlived assets and the associated asset retirement costs “sfas no 143” teledyne technologies’ initial adoption of sfas no 143 effective january 1 2003 did not have a material effect on its financial position or results of operations outlook   although 2004 earnings visibility is limited based on its current outlook the company’s management believes that first quarter and full year 2004 earnings per share will be in the range of approximately 015 to 017 and 080 to 086 respectively   the company’s 2004 outlook reflects anticipated growth in the company’s defense electronics and instrumentation businesses a slight recovery in some of the company’s short cycle electronics and 47 commercial aviation markets and 016 per share of pension expense for the full year 2004 given the finalization of actual fee negotiations for work performed on certain contracts in prior periods operating margin in the company’s systems engineering solutions segment is expected to be lower in 2004 compared with 2003 the company’s previous aircraft product liability policy expired in may 2003 as of june 1 2003 the total cost of the company’s aircraft product liability insurance increased approximately 10 million per month or approximately 75 the company’s current aircraft product liability policy will expire in may 2004 and the company is currently reviewing its alternatives 

  full year 2003 earnings included 69 million or 013 per share in pension expense the company currently expects approximately 85 million or 016 per share of pension expense in 2004 the increase in pension expense reflects in part a reduction in the discount rate assumption for the company’s defined benefit plan and a change in the company’s retirement benefits for nonunion new hires the company’s assumed discount rate will be 65 in 2004 compared to 70 in 2003 as of january 1 2004 nonunion new hires will be eligible to participate in an enhanced defined contribution plan as opposed to the company’s existing defined benefit plan currently teledyne technologies anticipates making an aftertax cash contribution of approximately 40 million to its pension plan in 2004 also under one of its spinoff agreements after november 29 2004 the company will be able to charge pension costs to the us government under various government contracts earnings per share summary diluted earnings per common share from continuing operations

federal aviation administration and the us coast guard   enhance manufacturing efficiency we intend to continue to enhance our manufacturing capability to both reduce the cost of our products and enable us to react quickly to changes in market demand we have further expanded our manufacturing operations in mexico to reduce the cost of our products and to expand our capabilities in contract manufacturing of sophisticated electronic modules that are typically produced in low to moderate volumes we improved our lean work cells in several electronics and communications product lines such as military and medical microelectronics and electromechanical 2 relays and significantly streamlined our manufacturing and assembly of sophisticated military electronics equipment in our lewisburg tennessee facility in 2002 all business units within our electronics and communications segment began collaborating on additional operational excellence initiatives to decrease our total cost of quality while maintaining the reliability standards for which our products are recognized in addition due to several years of increased sales we plan to upgrade our manufacturing capacity at our military traveling wave tube manufacturing facility by adding new test equipment and implementing enhanced manufacturing techniques in order to improve manufacturing cycle times 

  acquire complementary businesses we intend to grow in market segments where we have a strong competitive position both by developing new products and services and by acquiring highly complementary businesses we are focused on acquiring companies or product lines that might add new products to existing markets expand sales into related growth markets increase service revenues or enhance manufacturing or distribution capabilities our goal is to leverage both operational and market synergies so that acquisitions result in improvements in earnings for example during the third quarter of 2002 we acquired monitor labs incorporated a supplier of environmental monitoring instrumentation for the detection measurement and reporting of air pollutants the acquisition of monitor labs incorporated coupled with our earlier 2001 acquisition of advanced pollution instrumentation inc greatly expanded our presence in the air quality monitoring segment of the environmental instrumentation market our business segments electronics and communications   our electronics and communications segment sometimes referred to as teledyne electronic technologies provides a wide range of specialized electronic systems instruments components and services that address niche market applications in commercial aerospace communications defense industrial and medical markets instrumentation products   during 2001 we formed teledyne instruments a group of business units drawn from our electronics and communications segment and our systems engineering solutions segment to focus on monitoring and process control instrumentation in the fourth quarter of 2001 we acquired advanced pollution instrumentation inc a manufacturer of a broad line of instruments for monitoring low levels of gases such as sulfur dioxide carbon monoxide and ozone in september 2002 we acquired monitor labs incorporated a supplier of environmental monitoring instrumentation for the detection measurement and reporting of air pollutants   gas analysis teledyne analytical instruments was a pioneer in the development of precision oxygen analyzers and now offers a broad range of products with

increasingly providing our systems to airbus aircraft including the singleaisle a319320321 and longrange a340500600 with many us commercial airlines experiencing significant losses including bankruptcy we have increased our focus on providing our systems to nonus airlines such as ryan air in europe   our newest digital flight data acquisition units have some of the most advanced features in the industry these systems conform to the required expansion of data recording capabilities which were mandated by the faa in 1997 at that time the faa increased the number of mandatory parameters to be monitored from the 17 then required to 88 by 2002   our wireless groundlink tm product used on boeing 737 series and other aircraft automates the transfer of inflight data recorded by our data acquisition systems to an airline’s operations center as soon as an aircraft lands recorded flight data is transmitted to the airline’s operations center over the cellular telephone network and through the internet our flight data replay and analysis system can process the data into useful formats that can be used by the airline to schedule maintenance services and implement proper crew training and safety procedures   the market for data acquisition systems has been extended to business and commuter aircraft as these aircraft have begun to mirror air transport aircraft in terms of data gathering and aircraft monitoring we have obtained faa certification for our mini flight data acquisition unit on multiple platforms we are also one of the largest suppliers of airtoground telephony and data transmission products to the business and commuter aircraft market our smartcabin office tm system employs satellite links to provide integrated voice and highspeed data communications for business aircraft passengers   although our data acquisition recording and communications products are primarily used on commercial aircraft we have been pursuing military applications the u s air force selected our optical quick access recorder for use on its c17 globemaster iii military transport aircraft teledyne controls was also awarded a subcontract under a u s air force program to embed its communications software into aircraft flight management systems for the c130 transport and b767 tanker aircraft electronic components   traveling wave tubes our helix

  through aerosance inc we developed the first production full authority digital electronic controls for piston aircraft engines these controls known as powerlink tm fadec full authority digital electronic control are designed to automate many functions that currently require manual control such as fuel flow and power management this system also saves fuel as a result of improved engine management we continue the development of fadecequipped engines targeted at the most popular models of four and six cylinder piston aircraft engines in use throughout the world when general economic conditions improve we believe that these control systems will become standard equipment on new aircraft and will be retrofitted on higherend piston engine general aviation aircraft   in addition our gill tm line of lead acid batteries is widely recognized as the premier power source for general aviation we are now working to have our batteries included in business jet applications teledyne battery products in conjunction with teledyne controls jointly developed an onboard charging and cockpit display kit that permits existing nicad battery systems to be replaced with gill tm valveregulated lead acid batteries turbine engines   we design develop and manufacture small turbine engines for missiles and unmanned aerial vehicles we also produce engines that power military trainer aircraft   our j402 engine powers the harpoon missile system derivatives of this engine power the standoff land attack missile and the standoff land attack missileexpanded response lockheed martin corporation selected a derivative of the j402 engine to power the joint airtosurface standoff missile jassm we are the sole source provider of engines for the jassm system the jassm production requirement is currently estimated at 3700 units   another of our engines provides the turbine power for the improved tactical air launched decoy itald being built for the us navy the itald system enhances combat aircraft survivability by both serving as a decoy and identifying enemy radar sources this lowcost turbine engine is the first of a family of lowerthrust engines to enter production   we are the sole source for major spare parts for the engine for the t37 aircraft the primary jet trainer for the us air force this engine has been in service for over 40 years and is expected to continue to power the t37 well into this decade energy systems   our energy systems segment through teledyne energy systems inc provides hydrogen gas generators and thermoelectric and fuelcellbased power sources teledyne energy systems inc a majority owned subsidiary of tdy was formed in 2001 by combining teledyne brown engineering’s energy systems business unit with assets and intellectual properties of floridabased energy partners inc   our energy systems activities include a 50year history of supplying high reliability energy conversion devices and gas generation products based on thermoelectric and electrochemical processes we provided power systems for several successful deepspace missions such as the viking 1 and viking 2 mars landers and the pioneer 10 and 11 missions to jupiter and saturn the pioneer 10 power system is still operating 30 years after its launch and is now more than 75 billion miles from earth earthbound applications have included systems for high reliability unattended power generation in remote installations such as gas pipeline control stations and electrolytic highpurity hydrogen and oxygen gas generation used in many industrial processes   the transaction with energy partners inc added its capabilities in proton exchange membrane pem fuel cell technology to our existing capabilities in electrochemical conversion processes fuel cells produce electrical energy by direct electrochemical conversion of hydrogen and oxygen without moving 8 parts and with pure water as the only byproduct we believe that pem technology is at the leading edge of the new global thrust to advance the development of fuel cell generators for a variety of uses ranging from space missions to distributed power generation uninterruptible power supplies and portable power applications using either hydrogen or natural gas as a fuel 

  we also manufacture hydrogenoxygen gas generators that utilize the principle of electrolysis to convert water into high purity hydrogen gas at useable pressures our teledyne titan tm gas generators are used worldwide in electrical power generation plants semiconductor manufacture optical fiber production chemical processing and other industrial processes in 2002 we delivered our first completely preassembled enclosed hydrogen generationcompression system known as the teledyne h 2 oasis tm  this turnkey plant provided in a fully equipped transportable building is designed to meet the nearterm needs of industrial customers and provides a basis for responding to the gradually increasing demand for hydrogen refueling equipment   we have a line of fuel cell test stations designed to provide a completely integrated system for fuel cell testing for the pem fuel cell development market at present they are used for testing fuel cell components and single cells but we have expanded this product line to provide systems capable of testing multicell stacks rated from watts to kilowatts   we continue to seek applications for high reliability long endurance power systems for extreme environment applications we have developed an advanced pem fuel cell power plant for nasa’s second generation reusable launch vehicle that is expected to replace the existing space shuttle fleet customers   we have hundreds of customers in the electronics communications aerospace and defense industries no commercial customer accounted for more than 10 of our total sales during 2002 2001 or 2000   approximately 46 45 and 44 of our total sales for 2002 2001 and 2000 respectively were derived from contracts with agencies of and prime contractors to the us government our principal us government customer is the us department of defense in 2002 2001 and 2000 our largest program with the us government the boeing company — groundbased midcourse defense contract represented 75 74 and 66 of total sales respectively set forth below are sales by our segments to agencies and prime contractors to the us government for the periods presented us government sales    our total backlog of confirmed orders was approximately 3241 million at december 29 2002 3008 million at december 30 2001 and 3392 million at december 31 2000 sales and marketing   our sales and marketing approach varies by segment and products within our segments a shared fundamental tenet is the commitment to work closely with our customers to understand their needs with an aim to secure preferred supplier and longerterm relationships   our business segments use a combination of internal sales forces distributors and commissioned sales representatives to market and sell our products and services products are also advertised in appropriate trade journals and by means of various internet web sites to promote our products and other capabilities 9 our personnel regularly participate in relevant trade shows and professional associations many of our government contracts are awarded after a competitive bidding process in which we seek to emphasize our ability to provide superior products and technical solutions in addition to competitive pricing 

  principally through teledyne technologies international corp the company has established branch offices in foreign countries to facilitate international sales for various businesses competition   we believe that technological capabilities and innovation and the ability to invest in the development of new and enhanced products are critical to obtaining and maintaining leadership in our markets and the industries in which we compete generally although we have certain advantages that we believe help us compete in our markets effectively each of our markets is highly competitive our businesses vigorously compete on the basis of quality product performance and reliability technical expertise price and service many of our competitors have and potential competitors could have greater name recognition a larger installed base of products more extensive engineering manufacturing marketing and distribution capabilities and greater financial technological and personnel resources than we do research and development   our research and development efforts primarily involve engineering and design relating to improving product lines and developing new products and technologies in the same or related fields we spent a total of 1968 million 2107 million and 2474 million on research and development and bid and proposal costs for 2002 2001 and 2000 respectively customerfunded research and development most of which was attributable to work under contracts with the us government represented approximately 87 85 and 87 of total research and development costs for 2002 2001 and 2000 respectively   in 2002 approximately 64 of the 262 million in companyfunded research and development and bid and proposal costs were incurred in our electronics and communications businesses we expect the level of companyfunded research and development and bid and proposal costs to be approximately 292 million in 2003 intellectual property   while we own and control various intellectual property rights including patents trade secrets confidential information trademarks trade names and copyrights which in the aggregate are of material importance to our business our management believes that our business as a whole is not materially dependent upon any one intellectual property or related group of such properties we own several hundred active patents and are licensed to use certain patents technology and other intellectual property rights owned and controlled by others similarly other companies are licensed to use certain patents technology and other intellectual property rights owned and controlled by us   patents patent applications and license agreements will expire or terminate over time by operation of law in accordance with their terms or otherwise we do not expect the expiration or termination of these patents patent applications and license agreements to have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition   in connection with our spinoff in 1999 an affiliate of ati granted us an exclusive license to use the “teledyne” name and related logos symbols and marks in connection with our operations the annual fee is 100000 for this license and on november 24 2004 we have an option to purchase all rights and interests in the teledyne marks for 412000 employees   our total current workforce consists of approximately 5300 employees the international union of united automobile aerospace and agricultural implement workers of america represents approximately 20 of our employees in toledo ohio under a collective bargaining agreement that expired by its terms on 10 february 14 2003 but which was subsequently extended by mutual agreement for 90 days in addition this union also represents approximately 280 employees in mobile alabama under a collective bargaining agreement that expires on december 16 2003 and approximately 50 employees in abbeville alabama under a collective bargaining agreement that expires on october 15 2004 we consider our relations with our employees to be good 

executive management   tdy’s executive management includes  11  12  

   dr mehrabian has an amended and restated employment agreement with teledyne technologies which provides that we will employ him as the chairman president and chief executive officer the agreement terminates on december 31 of each year but will be extended annually unless either party gives the other written notice prior to october 31 of the year of such term that it will not be extended dr mehrabian has a base salary of 590000 for 2003 the agreement provides that dr mehrabian is entitled to participate in tdy’s annual incentive bonus plan and other executive compensation and benefit programs the agreement provides dr mehrabian with a nonqualified pension arrangement under which teledyne technologies will pay him following his retirement as payments supplemental to any accrued pension under our qualified pension plan an amount equal to 50 of his base compensation as in effect at retirement the number of years for which such annual amount shall be paid will be equal to the number of years of his service to tdy including service to ati but not more than 10 years   fourteen current members of management have entered into change in control severance agreements with teledyne technologies the agreements have a threeyear automatically renewing term under the agreements the executive is entitled to severance benefits if 1 there is a change in control of tdy and 2 within three months before or 24 months after the change in control either we terminate the executive’s employment for reasons other than for cause or the executive terminates employment for good reason “severance benefits” consist of  13  risk factors cautionary statement as to forwardlooking statements   the following text highlights various risks and uncertainties associated with teledyne technologies these factors could materially affect “forwardlooking statements” within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 that we may from time to time make including forwardlooking statements contained in “item 1 business” and “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” of this form 10k and in tdy’s 2002 annual report to stockholders united states’ and global responses to the middle east conflict terrorism and perceived nuclear threats increase uncertainties with respect to many of our businesses and may adversely affect the company’s business and results of operations   united states’ and global responses to the middle east conflict terrorism and perceived nuclear threats increase uncertainties with respect to us and other business and financial markets several factors associated directly or indirectly with the middle east conflict terrorism and perceived nuclear threats and responses may adversely affect the company   while some of our businesses that provide products or services to the us government experienced greater demand for their products and services as a result of increased us government defense spending various responses could realign government programs and affect the composition funding or timing of our government programs government spending could shift to defense programs including homeland security in which we do not participate or do not have current capabilities and curtail less pressing nondefense programs in which we do participate including department of energy or nasa programs   the effect of the decline in air travel on the financial condition of many of our commercial airline and aircraft manufacturer customers could adversely affect our electronics and communications segment a war in the middle east could adversely affect our nonus commercial airline and aircraft manufacturer customers who have not suffered deteriorating financial performance to the same extent as our us commercial airline and aircraft manufacturer customers deterioration of financial performance of airlines could result in a further reduction of discretionary spending for upgrades of avionics and inflight communications equipment which would adversely affect our electronics and communications segment   as happened after the september 11th terrorist attacks reinstatement of flight restrictions would negatively impact the market for general aviation aircraft piston engines and components and would adversely affect our aerospace engines and components segment potential reductions in the need for 14 general aviation aircraft maintenance due to declines in air travel could also adversely affect our aerospace engines and components segment 

  the company is increasingly experiencing adverse effects of september 11th which could increase in the event of additional terrorist attacks or a middle east war for example the september 11th tragedy has had significant impacts on the insurance markets greatly increasing insurance costs the company’s existing aircraft product liability insurance policy expires in may 2003 and the company is currently evaluating options relating to this insurance coverage in addition the resulting downturn in the stock market exacerbated by various public company issues has negatively affected the value of the company’s pension assets absent improved market conditions the company will be required to make cash contributions to its pension plan in 2004 worsening market conditions could increase the required contribution we may be unsuccessful in our efforts to increase our participation in certain new markets   we intend to both adapt our existing technology and develop new products to expand into new market segments for example we are developing new fuel cell related technologies the market for fuel cell technologies is not well established and there are a number of companies that have announced intentions to develop and market fuel cell products some of these companies have greater financial andor technological resources than we do   we are also developing new electronic products including highdensity microprocessor connectors and microwave modules for radios used in cellular communications infrastructure which are intended to access markets in which teledyne does not currently participate we may be unsuccessful in accessing these markets if our products do not meet our customers’ requirements due to either changes in technology and industry standards or because of actions taken by our competitors   in 2000 we announced our intention to capitalize on our existing technology and experience to penetrate communications markets particularly fiber optic communications components and wireless and satellite communications equipment the downturn in the semiconductor telecommunications and electronic manufacturing services markets coupled with deteriorating general economic conditions negatively impacted our optoelectronics growth initiative and our shortcycle electronics businesses such as electronic relays used in semiconductor test equipment and communications applications our dependence on revenue from government contracts subjects us to many risks including the risk that we may not be successful in bidding for future contracts and the risk that us government funding for these contracts may be diverted to other uses or delayed   we perform work on a number of contracts with the department of defense and other agencies and departments of the us government sales under contracts with the us government as a whole including sales under contracts with the department of defense as prime contract or subcontractor represented approximately 46 of our total revenue for 2002 performance under government contracts has certain inherent risks that could have a material effect on our business results of operations and financial condition   government contracts are conditioned upon the continuing availability of congressional appropriations congress typically appropriates funds for a given program on a fiscalyear basis even though contract performance may take more than one year as a result at the beginning of a major program a contract is typically only partially funded and additional monies are normally committed to the contract by the procuring agency only as appropriations are made by congress for future fiscal years   while the overall us military budget declined in real dollars from the mid1980s through the early 1990s as a result of the september 11th terrorist attacks and given the current middle east situation us defense spending has increased and is expected to increase over the next several years increased defense spending does not necessarily correlate to increased business for the company because not all the programs in which tdy participates or has current capabilities may be earmarked for increased funding 15 also over time programs can evolve and affect the extent of our participation for example one of teledyne brown engineering’s contracts has been restructured in 2003 to change the emphasis from a focus on test and evaluation to a focus on deployment and sustainment which will mean lesser revenues from this contract compared to 2002 furthermore we obtain many us government prime contracts and subcontracts through the process of competitive bidding we may not be successful in having our bids accepted 

  the company principally and traditionally through its systems engineering solutions segment has been a significant contributor to nasa programs while the centerpiece of our current nasa activities is the international space station as the payload integrator for nasa’s marshall space flight center we have had major responsibilities in numerous scientific missions of the space shuttle as a result of the columbia space shuttle tragedy nasa’s space shuttle programs could be negatively impacted depending on the duration of the us government investigation and grounding of shuttle flights   most of our us government contracts are subject to termination by the us government either at its convenience or upon the default of the contractor terminationforconvenience provisions provide only for the recovery of costs incurred or committed settlement expenses and profit on work completed prior to termination terminationfordefault imposes liability on the contractor for excess costs incurred by the us government in reprocuring undelivered items from another source   there is no guarantee that us government contracts will be profitable a number of our us government prime contracts and subcontracts are fixed pricetype contracts 41 in 2002 under these types of contracts we bear the inherent risk that actual performance cost may exceed the fixed contract price this is particularly true where the contract was awarded and the price finalized in advance of final completion of design we believe that the us government is increasingly requesting proposals for fixedpricetype contracts   certain fees under some of our us government contracts are linked to meeting development or testing deadlines in 2002 certain fees were also dependent on the collective efforts and success of other defense contractors over which we had no control in any event if a test is delayed or a target is missed we may not receive any award or incentive fee related to that particular test or target in our systems engineering solutions segment there is no assurance that the level of government award and incentive fees received in 2002 will continue in 2003   we like other government contractors are subject to various audits reviews and investigations including private party “whistleblower” lawsuits relating to our compliance with federal and state laws in addition we have a compliance program designed to surface issues that may lead to voluntary disclosures to the us government generally claims arising out of these us government inquiries and voluntary disclosures can be resolved without resorting to litigation however should the business unit or division involved be charged with wrongdoing or should the us government determine that the unit or division is not a “presently responsible contractor” that unit or division and conceivably our company as a whole could be temporarily suspended or in the event of a conviction could be debarred for up to three years from receiving new government contracts or governmentapproved subcontracts in addition we could expend substantial amounts in defending against such charges and in damages fines and penalties if such charges are proven or result in negotiated settlements in october 2002 the company was informed that the us government had declined to intervene in a lawsuit filed more than four years ago under seal pursuant to the false claims act the company intends to vigorously defend this continuing civil action against its electronic safety products unit which continues notwithstanding the us government’s nonintervention a declining stock market and lower interests rates negatively affect the value of our pension assets and could have a material adverse financial effect on us   we have a defined benefit pension plan covering substantially all of our employees at yearend 2002 because of significant declines in the stock market and low interest rates the value of the pension assets was less than our accumulated pension benefit obligation the accounting rules applicable to our pension 16 plan require that amounts recognized in financial statements to be determined on an actuarial basis rather than as contributions are made to the plan a significant element in determining our pension income or pension expense is the expected return on plan assets we have assumed based on the type of securities in which the plan assets are invested and the longterm historical returns of these investments that the longterm expected return on pension assets will be 85 in 2003 compared to 90 in 2002 and its assumed discount rate will be 70 in 2003 compared to 75 in 2002 

  since the spinoff we have recorded noncash pension income which has significantly declined due to the completion in 2001 of income amortization associated with the transition assets recorded pursuant to statement of financial accounting standards no 87 — “employers’ accounting for pensions” as well as the continued decline in the value of our pension assets coupled with reductions in our expected rate of return and discount rate assumptions used for pension plan calculations as described above we currently expect approximately 70 million noncash pension expense in 2003 compared to noncash pension income of 23 million 95 million and 90 million for 2002 2001 and 2000 respectively given our pension plan’s current underfunded status absent improved market conditions we will be required to make cash contributions to our pension plan in 2004 further declines in the stock market and lower rates of return could increase our required contribution also under one of our spinoff agreements the earliest we will be able to charge pension costs to the us government under our various government contracts will be november 29 2004   since the value of our pension assets at yearend 2002 was less than the accumulated pension benefit obligation the company recorded a 232 million noncash charge to stockholders’ equity a longterm intangible asset of 104 million and an additional longterm pension liability of 488 million this charge to equity did not affect net income and is recorded net of deferred taxes the charge will be reversed should the value of the pension assets exceed the accumulated pension benefit obligation as of a future measurement date we may be unable to successfully introduce new and enhanced products in a timely and costeffective manner   our operating results depend in part on our ability to introduce new and enhanced products on a timely basis successful product development and introduction depend on numerous factors including our ability to anticipate customer and market requirements changes in technology and industry standards our ability to differentiate our offerings from offerings of our competitors and market acceptance   we may not be able to develop and introduce new or enhanced products in a timely and costeffective manner or to develop and introduce products that satisfy customer requirements our new products also may not achieve market acceptance or correctly anticipate new industry standards and technological changes technological change could cause certain of our products or services to become obsolete or noncompetitive   the markets for a number of our products and services are generally characterized by rapid technological development evolving industry standards changes in customer requirements and new product introductions and enhancements a faster than anticipated change in one or more of the technologies related to our products or services or in market demand for products or services based on a particular technology could result in faster than anticipated obsolescence of certain of our products or services and could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operation and financial condition currently accepted industry standards are also subject to change which may contribute to the obsolescence of our products or services 17 we may not have sufficient resources to fund all future research and development and capital expenditures or possible acquisitions   in order to remain competitive we must make substantial investments in research and development to develop new and enhanced products and continuously upgrade our process technology and manufacturing capabilities   although we believe that anticipated cash flows from operations and available borrowings under our 200 million credit facility will be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated working capital research and development and capital investment needs we may be unable to fund all of these needs or possible acquisitions our ability to raise additional capital will depend on a variety of factors some of which will not be within our control including resurgence of the public offering market investor perceptions of us our businesses and the industries in which we operate and general economic conditions we may be unable to successfully raise additional capital if needed failure to successfully raise needed capital on a timely or costeffective basis could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition product liability claims or recalls could have a material adverse effect on our reputation business results of operations and financial condition   as a manufacturer and distributor of various products our results of operations are susceptible to adverse publicity regarding the quality or safety of our products in part product liability claims challenging the safety of our products may result in a decline in sales for a particular product which could adversely affect our results of operations this could be true even if the claims themselves are proven to not be truthful or settled for immaterial amounts   while we have general liability and other insurance policies concerning product liabilities we have selfinsured retentions or deductibles under such policies with respect to a portion of these liabilities for example our annual selfinsured retention for general aviation aircraft liabilities incurred in connection with products manufactured by teledyne continental motors inc is 100 million the september 11th tragedy has significantly impacted the insurance markets greatly increasing insurance costs since our existing aircraft product liability insurance policy expires in may 2003 the company is currently evaluating options relating to its aircraft product liability insurance coverage including a greater annual selfinsured retention   product recalls and field service actions could also have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition for example teledyne continental motors had been engaged in a product recall of piston engine crankshafts whereby the company recorded a 12 million pretax charge in the second quarter of 2000 in the second quarter of 1999 teledyne continental motors had an unrelated recall of piston engines for which the company recorded a 3 million pretax charge product recalls have the potential for tarnishing a company’s reputation and could have a material adverse effect on the sales of our products in 2002 we reached a monetary settlement related to the 2000 recall with two of three companies that manufactured and processed allegedly defective steel subsequently made into aircraft engine crankshafts we failed to win a jury verdict against a third company involved in making the steel the company continues to pursue cost recovery through litigation against one other materials supplier as a result of the 2000 product recall program there is no assurance that the company will recover any costs or the negative impact on its reputation   the gas generators manufactured by teledyne energy systems inc currently contain an asbestos component while the company is currently examining replacement materials has placed warning labels on its products and takes care in its handling with employees there is no assurance that the company will not face asbestosrelated liability claims   there has been an insurgence of asbestosrelated product liability lawsuits against multiple defendant companies that historically may have manufactured or sold products that had asbestoscontaining components the company has been named in a few such lawsuits where purported ties if any to its 18 historic products or businesses are unclear and imprecise the company is learning that its historic insurance coverage including that of its predecessors may not fully cover such claims and defense of such matters depending on the year of alleged exposure and other factors

certifications and has internal quality controls in place errors and omissions in analyses may occur we currently have nuclear liability insurance coverage that might apply depending on the circumstances we also are evaluating the costsbenefits of purchasing errors and omissions insurance coverage and have sought indemnities from some of our customers our insurance coverage or indemnities however may not be adequate to cover potential problems associated with faulty radiological analyses   our watersabre tm fluid jet cutting system is expected to be used in antiterrorism operations a mishap involving the use of such system in antiterrorism operations could result in various damages which could exceed available insurance coverages as a result we have been seeking indemnification from potential purchasers of this system these indemnities may be insufficient to offset liabilities that we may incur in connection with this system also since september 11th many insurers have been revising their insurance coverages to include terrorism exclusions several legislative developments such as the terrorism risk insurance act of 2002 and the support antiterrorism by fostering effective technologies act of 2002 could mitigate these exclusions the latter act provides a path for qualification of certain antiterrorism technologies by the secretary of homeland security and a resulting shield against some product liability suits we cannot however provide any assurance that we will not experience any problems in the future   we cannot assure that we will not have additional product liability claims or that we will not recall any additional products we may have difficulty obtaining product liability and other insurance coverages or be subject to increased costs for such coverage   the tragic events of september 11th have had a significant impact on the insurance industry greatly increasing insurance costs as a manufacturer of a variety of products including aircraft engines used in general aviation aircraft we have general liability and other insurance policies that provide coverage beyond selfinsured retentions or deductibles we cannot assure that for 2003 and in future years insurance carriers will be willing to renew coverage or provide new coverage for product liability especially as it relates to general aviation if such insurance is available we may be required to pay substantially higher prices for coverage andor increase our levels of selfinsured retentions or reserves the company is currently evaluating options with respect to its aircraft product liability insurance policy which expires in may 2003   for certain medical electronic components that we manufacture such as those that go into cochlear implants we have asked for indemnities from our customers andor to be included under their insurance policies we cannot however provide any assurance that such indemnities or insurance will offset potential liabilities that we may incur as a result of our manufacture of such components   aside from the uncertainties created by the events of september 11th and subsequent activities our ability to obtain product liability insurance and the cost for such insurance are affected by our historical claims experience we cannot assure that for 2003 and in future years our ability to obtain insurance or the cost for such insurance or the amount of selfinsured retentions or reserves will not be negatively impacted by our experience in prior years over the last few years our aircraft product liability claims experience has worsened due in part to an increasingly litigious environment   additionally our current directors and officers insurance coverage expires in november 2003 19 increasing competition could reduce the demand for our products and services   although we believe that we have certain advantages that help us compete in our markets each of our markets is highly competitive many of our competitors have and potential competitors could have greater name recognition a larger installed base of products more extensive engineering manufacturing marketing and distribution capabilities and greater financial technological and personnel resources than we do new or existing competitors may also develop new technologies that could adversely affect the demand for our products and services industry consolidation trends particularly among aerospace and defense contractors could adversely affect demand for our products and services if prime contractors seek to control more aspects of vertically integrated projects we sell products and services to customers in industries that are cyclical and sensitive to changes in general economic activity   we derive significant revenues from the commercial aerospace industry domestic and international commercial aerospace markets are cyclical in nature historic demand for new commercial aircraft has been related to the stability and health of domestic and international economies delays or changes in aircraft and component orders could impact the future demand for our products and have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition the tragic events of september 11th resulted in an accelerated downturn in the market for commercial aircraft and have increased the level of uncertainty regarding future orders for aircraft a potential middle east war further increases this uncertainty relating to aircraft orders   in addition we sell products and services to customers in industries that are sensitive to the level of general economic activity and in mature industries that are sensitive to capacity adverse economic conditions affecting these industries may reduce demand for our products and services which may reduce our profits or our production levels or both we sell products to customers in industries that may undergo rapid and unpredictable changes   we develop and manufacture products for customers in industries that have undergone rapid changes in the past for example we manufacture products and provide manufacturing services to companies that serve telecommunications markets during 2001 many segments of the telecommunications market experienced a dramatic and rapid downturn that resulted in cancellations or deferrals of orders for our products and services this market segment or others that we serve may exhibit rapid changes in the future and may adversely affect our operating results or our production levels or both we are subject to the risks associated with international sales   during 2002 international sales accounted for approximately 16 of our total revenues we anticipate that future international sales will continue to account for a significant percentage of our revenues risks associated with these sales include    any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition exchange rate fluctuations may negatively affect the cost of our products to 20 international customers and therefore reduce our competitive position in prior years weak conditions in asian economies have affected our results of operations adversely the september 11th terrorist attacks as well as fears of an international arms race have resulted in increased export scrutiny of sales of some of our products to international customers travel restrictions to middle eastern and other countries may negatively affect continuing international sales or service revenues from such regions 

compliance with increasing environmental regulations and the effects of potential environmental liabilities could have a material adverse financial effect on us   we like other industry participants are subject to various federal state local and international environmental laws and regulations we may be subject to increasingly stringent environmental standards in the future future developments administrative actions or liabilities relating to environmental matters could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition   in december 2002 we published an updated and streamlined environmental management systems manual which is based on the compliance focused environmental management system developed by the environmental protection agency’s national enforcement investigation center in the late 1990s during 2003 our facilities will be assessing developing and implementing their own environmental regulatory compliance and management plans based on this updated manual we have also instituted a “review and audit” program to monitor environmental risk and compliance where each facility will be reviewed and audited by an internal environmental team every three years while these internal controls are designed to reduce environmental risks and may be viewed favorably by environmental regulators when evaluating a situation they do not eliminate potential environmental liabilities   some of our businesses work with highly dangerous substances that require heightened standards of care for example as a systems contractor for the us army’s program manager for nonstockpile chemical materiel we conduct research development manufacturing test and evaluation and site operations related to the safe and environmentally protective disposal of small caches of chemical munitions and materiel located in over 30 states and territories the destruction of chemical weapons is an inherently dangerous activity except for a contained fire during a demonstration testing of a process designed to access rockets in a former program we have not experienced any accidents or other adverse consequences as a result of our participation in weapon destruction programs we cannot however assure that we will not experience any problems in the future although the federal government provides certain indemnities to contractors in these programs these indemnities may be insufficient to offset liabilities that we may incur in connection with our participation in these programs   for additional discussion of environmental matters see the discussion under the caption “other matters — environmental” of “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition” and notes 2 and 15 to notes to consolidated financial statements our inability to attract and retain key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our future success   our future success depends to a significant extent upon the continued service of our executive officers and other key management and technical personnel and on our ability to continue to attract retain and motivate qualified personnel recruiting and retaining skilled technical personnel is highly competitive the loss of the services of one or more of our key employees or our failure to attract retain and motivate qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations acquisitions involve inherent risks that may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition   our growth strategy includes possible acquisitions acquisitions involve various inherent risks such as  21    in the third quarter of 2002 we acquired monitor labs incorporated while this company’s products and customer base are complementary to tdy’s existing monitoring and control instruments there is no assurance that we will achieve all identified financial operating and distribution synergies we may not be able to sell or exit on acceptable terms product lines that we determine no longer meet with our growth strategy   consistent with our growth strategy to focus on markets to expand our profitable niche businesses we continually evaluate our product lines to ensure that they are aligned with our strategy our ability to dispose of product lines that may no longer be aligned with our strategy will depend on many factors including the terms and conditions of any asset purchase and sale agreement as well as industry business and economic conditions we cannot provide any assurance as to when if or on what terms any nonstrategic product lines will be sold also we cannot provide any assurance as to the availability timing terms or conditions of alternative courses of action including closure if any sale of any nonstrategic product line cannot be consummated failure of representations and assumptions underlying the irs tax ruling could cause the spinoff not to be taxfree to ati or to ati’s stockholders and may require us to indemnify ati   while the tax ruling relating to the qualification of the spinoff as a taxfree distribution within the meaning of section 355 of the internal revenue code generally is binding on the irs the continuing validity of the tax ruling is subject to certain factual representations and assumptions while we believe that we have satisfied our principal spinoff requirements by successfully and timely completing our required public offering and using the proceeds of such offering as required and through the passage of time among other things if the spinoff were not to qualify as a taxfree distribution within the meaning of section 355 of the code ati would recognize taxable gain generally equal to the amount by which the fair market value of the tdy common stock distributed to ati’s stockholders exceeded the tax basis in our assets in addition the distribution of our common stock to each ati stockholder would generally be treated as taxable in an amount equal to the fair market value of the tdy common stock such stockholder receives   the tax sharing and indemnification agreement between ati and tdy provides that we will be responsible for any taxes imposed on or other amounts paid by ati its agents and representatives and its stockholders as a result of the failure of the spinoff to qualify as a taxfree distribution within the meaning of section 355 of the code if the failure or disqualification is caused by certain postspinoff actions by or with respect to us including our subsidiaries or our stockholders if any of the taxes or other amounts described above were to become payable by us the payment could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flow and could exceed our net worth by a substantial amount provisions of our governing documents applicable law and our change in control severance agreements could make an acquisition of teledyne technologies more difficult   our restated certificate of incorporation amended and restated bylaws and rights agreement and the general corporation law of the state of delaware contain several provisions that could make the acquisition of control of teledyne technologies in a transaction not approved by our board of directors more difficult we have also entered into change in control severance agreements with 14 members of our management which could have an antitakeover effect 22 the market price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly since our spinoff from ati and could continue to do so   since the spinoff on november 29 1999 the market price of our common stock has ranged from a low of 76875 to a high of 305625 per share at february 28 2003 our closing stock price was 1275 fluctuations in our stock price could continue among the factors that could affect our stock price are    the stock markets in general and the markets for high technology companies in particular have experienced a high degree of volatility not necessarily related to the operating performance of particular companies we cannot provide assurances as to our stock price while the company believes its control systems are effective there are inherent limitations in all control systems and misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected   the company continues to take action to assure compliance with the internal controls disclosure controls and other requirements of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer does not expect that our internal controls and disclosure controls will prevent all error and all fraud a control system no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met in addition the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefit of controls must be relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within the company have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake further controls can be circumvented by individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more persons or by management override of the controls the design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions over time a control may be inadequate because of changes in conditions or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate because of inherent limitations in a costeffective control system misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected 








 item 2 properties   our principal facilities as of december 29 2002 are listed below although the facilities vary in terms of age and condition our management believes that these facilities have generally been well maintained and except for our rancho cordova california facility are adequate for current operations in 2003 the 23 company will be spending approximately 6 million to expand its companyowned rancho cordova california facility principally due to increased demand for military traveling wave tubes 

 24    we also own or lease facilities elsewhere in the united states and outside the united states including tijuana mexico gloucester england and cumbernauld scotland our executive offices are currently located at 12333 west olympic boulevard los angeles california 900641021 


 item 3 legal proceedings   from time to time we become involved in various lawsuits claims and proceedings related to the conduct of our business while we cannot predict the outcome of any lawsuits claims or proceedings our management does not believe that the disposition of any pending matters is likely to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or liquidity the resolution in any reporting period of one or more of these matters however could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations for that period

 item 5 market for registrant’s common equity and related stockholder matters tableend 

price range of common stock and dividend policy   our common stock is listed on the new york stock exchange and traded under the symbol “tdy” the following table sets forth for the periods indicated the high and low sale prices for the common stock as reported by the new york stock exchange    on february 28 2003 the closing sale price of our common stock as reported by the new york stock exchange was 1275 per share as of february 28 2003 there were approximately 7830 holders of record of the common stock   we currently intend to retain any future earnings to fund the development and growth of our business therefore we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future provisions of our credit agreement limit our ability to pay dividends to amounts exceeding 25 of cumulative net income subsequent to the effective date of the credit agreement as of december 29 2002 approximately 175 million was available for the payment of dividends under these provisions 26 


 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend   teledyne technologies is a leading provider of sophisticated electronic components instruments and communications products including data acquisition and communications equipment for airlines and business aircraft monitoring and control instruments for industrial and environmental applications and components and subsystems for wireless and satellite communications we also provide systems engineering solutions and information technology services for space defense and industrial applications and manufacture general aviation and missile engines and components as well as onsite gas and power generation systems   we serve niche market segments where performance precision and reliability are critical our customers include major industrial and communications companies government agencies aerospace prime contractors and general aviation companies we have developed strong core competencies in engineering software development and manufacturing that we can leverage both to sustain and grow our current niche businesses and to become an innovator in related highergrowth markets   we seek to grow in niche market segments where we have a strong competitive position both by development of new products and services and by acquiring businesses that are highly complementary to our current product lines we continually evaluate our product lines to ensure that they are aligned with our strategy we also continue to explore strategic alternatives for our aerospace and engines components segment including possible divestiture of one or more product lines these actions help us to direct capital and management focus to opportunities that best utilize our engineering resources and technical expertise   following a comprehensive review of the company’s operations teledyne technologies recorded a 264 million pretax charge in the second quarter of 2001 for asset impairments restructuring and other charges and inventory writedowns as a result teledyne technologies exited manufacturing for the following noncore product lines from its electronics and communications segment industrial solid state relays and certain microwave switches and filters the company’s process control software and sodium iodide crystals product lines within its systems engineering solutions segment were sold in the second quarter of 2001 teledyne technologies also exited certain environmental programs within this same segment   in addition in 2001 we realigned and changed the reporting structure of some of our business units our test services and geophysical instruments business units that were previously part of our systems engineering solutions segment are now part of an expanded instruments group under our electronics and communications segment this realignment also resulted in a new segment the energy systems segment the results of which had previously been reported under our systems engineering solutions segment the energy systems segment which provides onsite gas and power generation systems based on proprietary fuel cell electrolysis and thermoelectric technologies currently includes the majorityowned entity that was formed in the third quarter of 2001 accordingly we have restated our previously reported segment data to reflect this realignment and structure total sales and operating profit were not affected by these segment reporting changes   in november 2001 we acquired advanced pollution instrumentation inc api a designer and manufacturer of advanced air quality monitoring instruments based in san diego california in september 2002 we acquired monitor labs incorporated monitor labs monitor labs is a supplier of environmental monitoring instrumentations for the detection measurement and reporting of air pollutants with locations in englewood colorado and gibsonia pennsylvania both acquired companies are part of the instruments group under the electronics and communications segment 28   our fiscal year is determined based on a 5352week convention and ends on or about december 31 the following is our financial information for 2002 2001 and 2000 in millions except pershare amounts    we operate in four business segments electronics and communications systems engineering solutions aerospace engines and components and energy systems the segments’ respective contributions as a percentage of total sales from continuing operations for 2002 2001 and 2000 are summarized in the following table  results of operations   we reported 2002 net sales from continuing operations of 7727 million compared with net sales from continuing operations of 7443 million for 2001 and 7951 million for 2000 net income was 254 million 077 per diluted share for 2002 compared with 66 million 020 per diluted share for 2001 and 323 million 109 per diluted share for 2000 net income from continuing operations was 254 million 077 per diluted share for 2002 compared with 68 million 021 per diluted share for 2001 and 319 million 108 per diluted share for 2000 29   the increase in sales in 2002 compared with 2001 reflected improvement in all four reporting segments the largest sales growth was in the electronic and communications segment which included the sales contributions from monitor labs and api which were acquired in september 2002 and november 2001 respectively   the decrease in sales in 2001 compared with 2000 reflected significantly lower sales in the aerospace engines and components segment as well as slightly lower sales in the electronics and communications segment and the systems engineering solutions segment offset in part by higher sales in the energy systems segment   as noted above the company recorded a 264 million pretax charge in the second quarter of 2001 the 2001 charge included plans to exit within 12 months manufacturing for the following noncore product lines from its electronics and communications segment industrial solid state relays and certain microwave switches and filters the company’s process control software and sodium iodide crystals product lines within its systems engineering solutions segment were sold in the second quarter of 2001 we also exited certain environmental programs within this same segment annual sales for these noncore product lines were approximately 100 million in 2000 at december 29 2002 teledyne technologies recorded income of 01 million following the final resolution of the second quarter 2001 charge   cost of sales as a percentage of net sales for 2002 was lower compared with 2001 due to the benefit of cost reductions implemented in 2001 and 2002 and not having the inventory writedown in 2002 that was experienced in 2001 recorded in connection with the 2001 second quarter charge this favorability was partially offset by product mix differences a less favorable lifo adjustment and reduced noncash pension income   cost of sales as a percentage of net sales for 2001 was higher compared with 2000 due to the effect of lower volume on fixed costs product mix differences the impact of a 98 million inventory writedown in 2001 and higher investment in growth initiatives of 28 million for 2001   selling general and administrative expenses for 2002 were higher in total dollars than 2001 but lower as a percent of net sales the increase in expense was driven by higher charges related to aircraft product liability reserves and higher aircraft liability insurance premiums additional selling general and administrative expenses for the api acquisition and the monitor labs acquisition partially offset by cost reductions and lower research and development expenditures   selling general and administrative expenses for 2001 were lower compared with 2000 both in total dollars and as a percentage of net sales selling general and administrative expenses for 2001 included greater investment in growth initiatives of 27 million compared with 2000 selling general and administrative expenses for 2000 include the 120 million piston engine product recall reserve as well as a gain of 14 million in our chemical weapons demilitarization business related to additional program funding restructuring asset impairment and other charge information   as noted above in the second quarter of 2001 the company recorded a 264 million charge of which 74 million was for asset impairments 87 million was for restructuring and other charges 100 million was for inventory writedowns and a 03 million pretax charge for discontinued operations   the charge also included restructuring charges for employee termination benefits the consolidation and downsizing of manufacturing operations noncancelable lease expenses and transaction costs associated with the formation of teledyne energy systems inc teledyne technologies reduced its total workforce by approximately 14 during 2001 the company recorded asset impairment charges for equipment net of expected sale proceeds and goodwill related to product lines to be discontinued and the loss on the sale of noncore product lines a charge was also recorded in cost of sales for the writeoff of inventory from discontinued product lines and the writedown of excess inventory resulting from reduced 30 customer demand the company has exited the manufacturing of industrial solid state relays and certain microwave switches and filters from its electronics and communications segment 

  during 2002 the company completed the efforts related to the 2001 second quarter charge of 264 million recording actual charges of 263 million at yearend 2002 the cumulative restructuring charges were 81 million 07 million lower than the 2001 yearend estimate at yearend 2002 the cumulative charges to cost of sales related to excess and obsolete inventory were 104 million 06 million higher than the 2001 year endestimate with no change to either the asset impairment charge or the charge for discontinued operations this resulted in 02 million of income in the electronics and communications segment in 2002 and an additional cost impact of 01 million in the systems engineering segment during 2002 in addition there were some changes in income statement classification final charges by segment were as follows 154 million in the electronics and communication segment 56 million in the energy systems segment 45 million in the systems engineering solutions segment and 03 million in the aerospace engines and components segment the 263 million charge also included a 02 million restructuring charge for the corporate office and a charge of 03 million for discontinued operations the following table details the components of the 2001 second quarter charge and the final resolution of the changes in estimate at december 29 2002 and december 30 2001 amounts in millions    the following table details the original 2001 second quarter charge by segment and the final resolution of the changes in estimate at december 29 2002 and december 30 2001 amounts in millions    the 2000 results include a pretax charge of 120 million for product recall reserves in the aerospace engines and components segment the 2000 results also include 14 million of pretax charges for cost adjustments in selected product lines in the systems engineering solutions segment and 08 million of pretax charges for receivables adjustments in the energy systems segment   international sales represented approximately 16 of net sales in 2002 and 17 of net sales for 2001 and 2000 sales under contracts with the us government were approximately 46 of net sales in 2002 45 of net sales for 2001 and 44 of net sales for 2000 31   in 2002 aggregate segment operating profit was 573 million compared with 242 million in 2001 and 724 million in 2000 and reflects the pretax charges noted above included in operating profit was pension income of 23 million in 2002 95 million in 2001 and 90 million in 2000 pension expense for 2003 is expected to be approximately 70 million the reduction in net pension income reflects the completion in 2001 of income amortization associated with the transition assets recorded pursuant to financial accounting standards board fasb statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 87 — “employers’ accounting for pensions” as well as the decline in the market value of the company’s pension assets during 2002 2001 and 2000   total interest expense on debt was 09 million in 2002 21 million in 2001 and 54 million in 2000 the decrease in interest expense in 2002 compared with 2001 primarily reflected lower average outstanding debt levels in 2002 as well as lower average interest rates the decrease in interest expense in 2001 compared with 2000 primarily reflected lower average outstanding debt levels in 2001 interest income was 03 million in 2002 02 million in 2001 and 01 million in 2000   in 2002 we recorded a 05 million charge in other expense related to the partial writedown of the company’s 28 million costbased investment in a private company engaged in manufacturing and development of micro optics and microelectromechanical devices in 2001 other income reflects a gain of 17 million related to sale of the company’s share of an optical components company all three fiscal years include sublease rental income and royalty income segments   the following discussion of our four segments should be read in conjunction with note 14 to the notes to consolidated financial statements electronics and communications    our electronics and communications segment provides a wide range of specialized electronic systems instruments components and services that address niche market applications in commercial aerospace communications defense industrial and medical markets   2002 compared with 2001   our electronics and communications segment sales were 3880 million in 2002 compared with sales of 3697 million in 2001 operating profit was 359 million in 2002 compared with 99 million in 2001 operating profit for 2002 included 02 million of income resulting from the final resolution of the previously cited second quarter 2001 charges operating profit for 2001 included pretax charges of 156 million described below   sales in 2002 compared with 2001 grew in electronic manufacturing services electronic instruments and defense electronic products the sales growth in electronic manufacturing services was primarily driven by increased sales from medical and military markets the sales growth in electronic instruments resulted from the acquisitions of monitor labs in september 2002 and api in november 2001 as well as stronger demand for geophysical sensors for the petroleum exploration market these sales increases were partially offset by continued weakness in the commercial aviation market and the continued weakness in the 32 demand for relays used in semiconductor test equipment and communications applications operating profit reflects the impact of the sales differences a reduction in the segment’s commercial broadband communications investments savings from a reduced workforce and decreased administrative expenses compared with 2001 these operating profit improvements were partially offset by the 08 million writedown of certain optoelectronic equipment and reduced noncash pension income of 49 million 

  2001 compared with 2000   our electronics and communications segment sales were 3697 million in 2001 compared with sales of 3734 million in 2000 operating profit was 99 million in 2001 compared with 393 million in 2000 operating profit for 2001 included pretax charges of 156 million described below   sales in 2001 compared with 2000 grew in military and commercial microwave products microelectronic products including optoelectronics business and commuter aircraft communications equipment and geophysical sensors for the petroleum exploration market this growth was more than offset by weakness in demand for relays used in semiconductor test equipment and communications applications electronic manufacturing services and other commercial electronic products operating profit reflected the impact of sales differences operating profit for 2001 reflected 148 million of costs associated with optoelectronics and wireless growth initiatives compared with 93 million in 2000 additionally 2001 included pretax charges of 156 million related to the following actions 67 million of restructuring costs 37 million of asset impairment charges and 52 million to writeoff inventory for products to be discontinued and excess inventory systems engineering solutions    our systems engineering solutions segment principally through teledyne brown engineering inc offers a wide range of engineering solutions and information services to government defense and aerospace customers   2002 compared with 2001   our systems engineering solutions segment sales were 2067 million in 2002 compared with sales of 2008 million in 2001 operating profit was 206 million in 2002 compared with 121 million in 2001 operating profit in 2002 included 01 million of expense resulting from the final resolution of the previously cited second quarter 2001 charges operating profit in 2001 included pretax charges of 44 million described below   sales in 2002 compared with 2001 reflected revenue growth in core defense and aerospace programs this growth was partially offset by reduced work for environmental programs operating profit reflects the impact of the sales differences the receipt of government award and incentive fees based upon collective performance achievements improved performance on environmental programs and reduced administrative expenses these operating profit improvements were partially offset by reduced noncash pension income of 07 million 33 2001 compared with 2000   sales for our systems engineering solutions segment in 2001 were 2008 million compared with 2123 million in 2000 for 2001 operating profit was 121 million compared with 182 million for 2000 operating profit for 2001 included pretax charges of 44 million described below   the 2001 results compared with 2000 reflected growth in core defense and aerospace programs this growth was more than offset by reduced work for environmental programs and sales reductions resulting from the disposition of the process control software and certain environmental product lines additionally results for 2001 included pretax charges of 44 million related to the following actions asset impairment charges of 37 million 03 million to writeoff inventory for discontinued products and excess inventory and 04 million of restructuring costs the 2000 results included a gain of approximately 14 million in the company’s chemical weapons demilitarization business related to additional program funding and were negatively impacted by 14 million for cost adjustments and a writedown of approximately 09 million in the our process control software business aerospace engines and components    our aerospace engines and components segment principally through teledyne continental motors inc focuses on the design development and manufacture of piston engines turbine engines electronic engine controls and batteries   2002 compared with 2001   our aerospace engines and components segment sales were 1629 million in 2002 compared with sales of 1592 million in 2001 operating profit was 27 million in 2002 compared with 82 million in 2001   sales in 2002 compared with 2001 reflected revenue growth in oem piston engines and aftermarket parts and services partially offset by reduced sales of military turbine engines operating profit in 2002 was negatively impacted by the requirement for higher aircraft liability reserves increased insurance premiums and crankshaft litigation costs net of settlement awards operating profit was also negatively impacted by a less favorable lifo adjustment due to the fact that the 2002 inventory reduction was not as significant as the 2001 inventory reduction furthermore operating profit was negatively impacted in 2002 by a 14 million reduction in noncash pension income operating profit in 2001 included restructuring charges of 03 million   in 2002 we reached a monetary settlement with two of the three companies that

  sales in 2001 compared with 2000 reflected reduced orders for piston engine aftermarket products due to the weakness of the economy flight restrictions resulting from the september 11th terrorist attacks also adversely affected orders for aftermarket piston engines and components turbine engine sales were lower in 2001 compared with 2000 due to reduced spare part sales for airforce training aircraft and reduced foreign demand for cruise missiles operating profit reflects the lower level of sales which was partially offset by cost reductions implemented in the first quarter of 2001 additionally pretax charges of 03 million for 2001 were related to the second quarter restructuring charge energy systems    our energy systems segment through teledyne energy systems inc provides onsite gas and power generation systems based on proprietary fuel cell electrolysis and thermoelectric technologies   2002 compared with 2001   our energy systems sales were 151 million in 2002 compared with sales of 146 million in 2001 the 2002 operating loss was 19 million compared with a 2001 operating loss of 60 million the 2001 results included pretax charges of 56 million described below   sales in 2002 compared with 2001 grew in government program sales the 2002 higher operating loss excluding the 2001 pretax charges was driven by higher research and development expense higher general and administrative expense and higher than anticipated costs for certain hydrogen generator programs furthermore segment operating loss was negatively impacted by a 02 million reduction in noncash pension income   2001 compared with 2000   our energy systems segment’s sales were 146 million in 2001 compared with sales of 96 million in 2000 the 2001 operating loss was 60 million compared with an operating loss of 09 million for 2000 the 2001 pretax charges of 56 million related to the following actions 12 million of restructuring and other costs 43 million to writeoff inventory for products to be discontinued and excess inventory and 01 million of asset impairment the 2000 results included pretax charges of 08 million for receivables adjustments sales in 2001 compared with 2000 reflected improved sales in longterm government contracts as well as improved performance in the hydrogen generator product line the 2001 operating results compared with the 2000 operating results reflected increased fuel cell development spending financial condition liquidity and capital resources   our principal capital requirements are to fund working capital needs capital expenditures and any debt service requirements it is anticipated that operating cash flow together with available borrowings under the credit facility described below will be sufficient to meet these requirements in the year 2003 our liquidity is not dependent upon the use of offbalance sheet financial arrangements we have no off 35 balance sheet financing arrangements that incorporate the use of special purpose entities or unconsolidated entities 

  in 2002 cash provided from continuing operations was 742 million compared with 190 million in 2001 and 365 million in 2000 the improvement in cash flow in 2002 compared with 2001 reflected higher net income from continuing operations in 2002 and significantly lower cash payouts for aircraft product liability settlements and product recall payments by 190 million the 2002 cash flow amount also reflected improved working capital management the improvement in cash flow reflected the impact of 58 million for income tax refunds net of cash payments in 2002 compared with net cash payments for income taxes of 46 million in 2001 which included the final required tax payment for the twelve months of 2000 the deferred income tax and the accrued pension obligation components of the cash flow statement in 2002 both were affected by the deferred tax amount of 152 million related to the minimum pension liability adjustment recorded in 2002 resulting in no impact on cash flow from operations in 2002   the decrease in cash provided from operations in 2001 compared with 2000 primarily reflected lower net income from continuing operations in 2001 and significantly higher cash payouts for aircraft product liability settlements and crankshaft recall payments by 131 million cash flow in 2001 also reflected higher cash payments for income taxes compared with 2000   the 2002 and 2001 cash used by discontinued operations each reflected the payment of a purchase price adjustment as well as workers’ compensation insurance payments   working capital decreased to 1026 million at yearend 2002 compared with 1153 million at yearend 2001 the decrease in working capital was primarily due to higher accounts payable payroll and accrued liability balances partially offset by higher inventory and cash balances see further explanations below some of the company’s customers have been undergoing bankruptcies none of which currently are expected to have a material adverse effect on the company   the changes in the following components of teledyne technologies balance sheet are discussed below in millions    the higher balance in inventories at december 29 2002 compared with december 30 2001 reflected higher balances in the electronics and communications segment including 31 million for monitor labs which was acquired in september 2002 prepaid expenses taxes and other current assets decreased following the receipt of a federal income tax refund of 57 million the decrease in property plant and equipment primarily reflected capital spending which was more than offset by depreciation and amortization longterm deferred taxes in 2002 included a 152 million increase in connection with a noncash charge to accumulated other comprehensive income related to the company’s pension plan the charge to equity was required since the value of the company’s pension assets was less than the accumulated pension benefit obligation as of yearend 2002 in addition teledyne technologies recorded a longterm intangible asset of 104 million included in other assets and an additional longterm pension liability of 488 million in 2002 the accrued pension obligation is net of prepaid pension costs in 2001 36 prepaid pension cost was 52 million the charge to equity did not affect net income and is recorded net of deferred taxes the increase in goodwill reflects goodwill acquired in the monitor labs acquisition in 2002 the increase in accounts payable reflected higher balances in the aerospace engines and components segment due to the timing of payments and higher balances in the electronics and communications segment which increased in line with the increase in inventory the increase in shortterm accrued liabilities primarily reflected higher payroll accruals as well as income taxes payable at yearend 2002 compared with no income taxes payable at yearend 2001 all longterm debt outstanding at december 30 2001 was paid off in 2002

pem fuel cell stacks test stands and systems   cash used in financing activities for 2002 primarily reflected the payment of longterm debt cash provided by financing activities for 2001 primarily reflected borrowings under a revolving credit agreement cash used in financing activities for 2000 reflected the payment of longterm debt and use of the net proceeds of 840 million from the public offering of 46 million shares of our common stock the public offering proceeds were used in accordance with ati’s tax ruling as amended all three years reflect proceeds from the exercise of stock options 37   a 200 million fiveyear revolving credit agreement that terminates in november 2004 was arranged with a syndicate of banks in connection with the spinoff ati drew 100 million under the facility prior to our assumption of the facility teledyne technologies assumed the repayment obligation for the amount drawn by ati at december 29 2002 we had no longterm debt outstanding at december 30 2001 we had 30 million outstanding under the facility at an average interest rate of 260 excluding interest and fees no payments are due under the credit facility until the facility terminates the estimated fair value of our longterm debt at yearend 2001 was 30 million   at yearend 2002 we had 200 million of available committed credit under the credit facility which can be utilized as needed for daily operating and periodic cash needs borrowings under the credit facility bear interest at our option at a rate based on either a defined base rate or the london interbank offered rate libor plus applicable margins the credit agreement also provides for facility fees that vary between 035 and 020 of the credit line depending on our capitalization ratio as calculated from time to time this credit facility requires the company to comply with various financial covenants and restrictions including covenants and restrictions relating to indebtedness liens investments dividend payments consolidated net worth interest coverage and the ratio of total consolidated indebtedness to earnings before interest taxes and depreciation and amortization the credit agreement prohibits the declaration of dividends or making other specified distributions in amounts exceeding 25 of cumulative net income after the effective date of the credit agreement 175 million at december 29 2002 we also have available 100 million under an uncommitted bank facility with no outstanding amounts at yearend 2002 or 2001 this credit line is utilized as needed for periodic cash needs   in connection with the spinoff a defined benefit pension plan was established and teledyne technologies assumed the existing pension obligations for all of the employees both active and inactive at the operations which perform government contract work and for active employees at operations which do not perform government contract work ati transferred pension assets to fund the new defined benefit pension plan sfas 87 “employers’ accounting for pensions” requires that a minimum pension liability be recorded if the value of pension assets is less than the accumulated pension benefit obligation since this condition existed as of yearend 2002 the company recorded a 232 million noncash charge to stockholders’ equity a longterm intangible asset of 104 million and an additional longterm pension liability of 488 million the charge to equity did not affect net income and is recorded net of deferred taxes and will be reversed should the value of the pension assets exceed the accumulated pension benefit obligation as of a future measurement date see note 13 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional pension disclosures   the tax sharing and indemnification agreement between ati and teledyne technologies provides that we will indemnify ati and its agents or representatives for taxes imposed on and other amounts paid by them or ati’s stockholders if we take actions or fail to take actions that result in the spinoff not qualifying as a taxfree distribution if any of the taxes or other amounts described above were to become payable by teledyne technologies the payment could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flow and could exceed our net worth by a substantial amount the company believes that it has satisfied its principal spinoff requirements when it completed its 2000 public offering and used the proceeds for research and development and related capital projects for the further development of manufacturing capabilities and for acquisitions andor joint ventures other matters   taxes   the effective income tax rate was 397 in 2002 2001 and 2000 based on the company’s history of operating earnings expectations of future operating earnings and tax planning strategies it is more likely than not that the deferred income tax assets at december 29 2002 will be realized 38   costs and pricing   inflationary trends in recent years have been moderate we primarily use the lastin firstout method of inventory accounting that reflects current costs in the costs of products sold these costs the increasing costs of equipment and other costs are considered in establishing sales pricing polices the company emphasizes cost containment in all aspects of its business hedging activities market risk disclosures   we have not utilized derivative financial instruments such as futures contracts options and swaps forward foreign exchange contracts or interest rate swaps and futures during 2002 and 2001 while we believe that adequate controls are in place to monitor any hedging activities in which we may engage many factors including those beyond our control such as changes in domestic and foreign political and economic conditions could adversely affect these activities our primary exposure to market risk relates to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates we periodically evaluate these risks and have taken measures to mitigate these risks we own assets and operate facilities in countries that have been politically stable also our foreign risk management objectives are geared towards stabilizing cash flow from the effects of foreign currency fluctuations most of the company’s sales are denominated in us dollars which mitigates the effect of exchange rate changes all of the company’s longterm debt has been based on a fluctuating market interest rate and consequently the fair value should not be affected materially by changes in market interest rates overall we believe that our exposure to interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange rate changes is not material to our financial condition or results of operations   related party transactions   in connection with the spinoff teledyne technologies and ati entered into several agreements governing the separation of our businesses and various employee benefits compensation tax indemnification and transition arrangements the company’s principal spinoff requirements to ensure a favorable tax treatment have been satisfied we successfully completed our required public offering in august 2000 and used the offering proceeds in accordance with ati’s tax ruling as amended since august 2002 the second anniversary of our 2000 public offering we no longer need ati’s consent to make stock repurchases the requirement that at least a majority of our directors be members of the board of directors of ati expired at our 2002 annual meeting of stockholders four of our nine directors continue to serve on ati’s board in addition under one of our spinoff agreements the earliest the company will be able to charge pension costs to the u s government under various government contracts will be november 29 2004 we also license the “teledyne” name and related logos symbols and marks from an affiliate of ati   our chairman president and chief executive officer is a director of mellon financial corporation another of our directors is a former chief executive officer and director of mellon financial corporation all transactions with mellon bank na and its affiliates are effected under normal commercial terms and we believe that our relationships with mellon bank na and its affiliates are armslength mellon bank na is one of nine lenders under our 200 million credit facility having committed up to 33750000 under the facility it also provides cash management services and an uncommitted 100 million line of credit mellon bank na serves as trustee under our pension plan and provides investment services for the plan mellon investor services llc serves as our transfer agent and registrar as well as agent under our stockholders rights plan   environmental   we are subject to various federal state local and international environmental laws and regulations which require that we investigate and remediate the effects of the release or disposal of materials at sites associated with past and present operations these include sites at which teledyne technologies has been identified as a potentially responsible party under the comprehensive environmental response 39 compensation and liability act commonly known as superfund and comparable state laws we are currently involved in the investigation and remediation of a number of sites reserves for environmental investigation and remediation totaled approximately 24 million at december 29 2002 as investigation and remediation of these sites proceed and new information is received the company expects that accruals will be adjusted to reflect new information based on current information we do not believe that future environmental costs in excess of those already accrued will materially and adversely affect our financial condition or liquidity however resolution of one or more of these environmental matters or future accrual adjustments in any one reporting period could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations for that period 

  with respect to proceedings brought under the federal superfund laws or similar state statutes the company has been identified as a potentially responsible party at approximately 17 such sites excluding those sites at which teledyne technologies believes it has no future liability our involvement is very limited or de minimis at approximately nine of these sites and the potential loss exposure with respect to any of the remaining eight sites is not considered to be material   for additional discussion of environmental matters see notes 2 and 15 to the notes to consolidated financial statements   government contracts   we perform work on a number of contracts with the department of defense and other agencies and departments of the us government sales under contracts with the us government which included contracts with the department of defense were approximately 46 of total sales in 2002 45 of total sales in 2001 and 44 of total sales in 2000 for a summary of sales to the us government by segment see note 14 to the notes to consolidated financial statements sales to the department of defense represented approximately 30 30 and 31 of total sales for 2002 2001 and 2000 respectively   performance under government contracts has certain inherent risks that could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business results of operations and financial condition government contracts are conditioned upon the continuing availability of congressional appropriations which usually occurs on a fiscal year basis even though contract performance may take more than one year while the overall us military budget declined in real dollars from the mid1980s through the early 1990s us defense spending is expected to increase over the next several years as a result of the september 11th terrorist attacks as well as the united states’ and global responses to the middle east conflict terrorism and perceived nuclear threats notwithstanding the potential for increased defense spending delays or declines in us military expenditures in the programs in which we participate could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition   for information on accounts receivable from the us government see note 6 to the notes to consolidated financial statements   estimates and reserves   our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent liabilities on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including those related to product returns allowance for doubtful accounts inventories investments intangible assets income taxes warranty obligations pension and other postretirement benefits environmental and other contingencies and litigation we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances at the time the results of which form the basis for making our judgments actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions in some cases such differences may be material see “other matters — critical accounting policies” 40   the following table reflects significant reserves and valuation accounts which are estimates and based on judgments as described above at december 29 2002 and december 30 2001 reserves and valuation accountsa in millions 

    critical accounting policies   our critical accounting policies are those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties and may potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions we have identified the following as critical accounting policies revenue recognition impairment of longlived assets income taxes inventories and related allowance for obsolete and excess inventory aircraft product liability reserve and accounting for pension plans for additional discussion of the application of these and other accounting policies see note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements   revenue recognition   commercial sales and revenue from us government fixedpricetype contracts are generally recorded as shipments are made or as services are rendered occasionally for certain fixedprice type contracts that require substantial performance over a long time period one or more years before shipments begin in accordance with the requirements of statement of position 811 “accounting for performance of constructiontype and certain productiontype contracts” revenues may be recorded based upon attainment of scheduled performance milestones which could be time event or expense driven in these few instances invoices are submitted to the customer under a contractual agreement and the customer makes payments sales under costreimbursement contracts are recorded as costs are incurred and fees are earned since certain contracts extend over a long period of time all revisions in cost and funding estimates during the progress of work have the effect of adjusting the current period earnings on a cumulative catchup basis if the current contract estimate indicates a loss provision is made for the total anticipated loss   some of the company’s products are subject to specified warranties the company maintains a reserve for the estimated future costs of repair replacement or customer accommodation and periodically reviews this reserve for adequacy such review would generally include a review of historic warranty experience with respect to the applicable business or products as well as the length and actual terms of the warranties   the company follows the requirements of securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 101 “revenue recognition in financial statements” 41 impairments of longlived assets   we monitor the recoverability of the carrying value of our longlived assets an impairment charge is recognized when events and circumstances indicate that the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by an asset including any proceeds from dispositions are less than the carrying value of the asset and the asset’s carrying value is less than its fair value our cash flow estimates are based on historical results adjusted to reflect our best estimate of future market and operating conditions the net carrying value of assets not recoverable is reduced to fair value our estimates of fair value represent our best estimate based on industry trends and reference to market rates and transactions as a result of a review in the second quarter of 2001 we determined that the carrying amounts of certain of our longlived assets were no longer recoverable based on estimates of future operating cash flows to be generated by these assets as a result we recognized an impairment charge of approximately 75 million in 2001 in 2002 we recorded a 08 million writedown of certain optoelectronic equipment and a 05 million charge related to the partial writedown of the company’s 28 million costbased investment in a private company engaged in manufacturing and development of micro optics and microelectromechanical devices accounting for income taxes   as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate this process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which are included within our consolidated balance sheet we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income recognizing that future taxable income may give rise to new deferred tax assets to the extent that we believe that future recovery is not likely we must establish a valuation allowance to the extent we establish or increase a valuation allowance we must include an expense within the tax provision in the income statement   significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets based on our history of operating earnings we have not recorded a valuation allowance as of december 29 2002 in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods we may need to establish a valuation allowance which could impact our financial position and results of operations   provisions for income taxes for 2002 2001 and 2000 are based on numerous factors that are subject to audit by the internal revenue service and the tax authorities in the various jurisdictions in which we do business inventories and related allowance for obsolete and excess inventory   inventories are valued at the lower of cost lastin firstout firstin firstout and average cost methods or market less progress payments we primarily use the lastin firstout method of inventory accounting that reflects current costs in the costs of products sold costs include direct material direct labor applicable manufacturing and engineering overhead and other direct costs inventories have been reduced by an allowance for excess and obsolete inventories the estimated allowance is based on management’s review of inventories on hand compared to assumptions about future demand and market conditions if actual future demand or market conditions are more or less favorable than those currently projected by management adjustments may be required we recorded a charge of 98 million in 2001 for the writeoff of inventory from discontinued product lines and the writedown of excess inventory resulting from reduced customer demand this charge was increased by 06 million in 2002 following the final resolution of the second quarter 2001 charge 42 aircraft product liability reserve   we are currently involved in certain legal proceedings related to aircraft product liability claims we have accrued an estimate of the probable costs for the resolution of these claims this estimate has been developed in consultation with our insurers outside counsel handling our defense in these matters and historical experience and is based upon an analysis of potential results assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies we do not believe these proceedings will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position it is possible however that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by specific events occurring in the period changes in our assumptions or the effectiveness of our strategies related to these proceedings while we have aircraft and product liability insurance our annual selfinsured retention for general aviation aircraft liabilities incurred in connection with products manufactured by teledyne continental motors is 100 million we cannot assure that for 2003 and in future years our ability to obtain insurance or the premiums for such insurance or the amount of our selfinsured retention or reserves will not be negatively impacted by our experience in prior years or other factors the september 11th tragedy had a negative impact on insurance markets and significantly increased insurance costs our current aircraft product liability insurance policy expires may 2003 accounting for pension plans   teledyne technologies has a defined benefit pension plan covering substantially all of its employees the company accounts for its defined benefit pension plan in accordance with sfas no 87 — “employers’ accounting for pensions” which requires that amounts recognized in financial statements be determined on an actuarial basis rather than as contributions are made to the plan a significant element in determining the company’s pension income or expense in accordance with sfas no 87 is the expected return on plan assets the company has assumed based upon the types of securities the plan assets are invested in and the longterm historical returns of these investments that the longterm expected return on pension assets will be 85 in 2003 compared with 90 in 2002 and its assumed discount rate will be 70 in 2003 compared with 75 in 2002 the assumed longterm rate of return on assets is applied to the marketrelated value of plan assets at the end of the previous year this produces the expected return on plan assets that is included in annual pension income or expense for the current year the cumulative difference between this expected return and the actual return on plan assets is deferred and amortized into pension income or expense over future periods today’s volatile and declining market is having a greater impact on the company as noted above since the value of the company’s pension assets at yearend 2002 were less than the accumulated pension benefit obligation the company recorded a 232 million noncash charge to stockholders’ equity a longterm intangible asset of 104 million and an additional longterm pension liability of 488 million the charge to equity did not affect net income and is recorded net of deferred taxes the charge will be reversed should the value of the pension assets exceed the accumulated pension benefit obligation as of a future measurement date see note 13 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional pension disclosures recent accounting pronouncements
