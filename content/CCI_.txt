 item 1 business 

overview 

we own operate and lease shared communications infrastructure that is geographically dispersed throughout the us including more than 1 40000 towers and other structures such as rooftops collectively towers and 2 80000 route miles of fiber primarily supporting small cell networks small cells and fiber solutions we refer to our towers fiber and small cells assets collectively as communications infrastructure and to our customers on our communications infrastructure as tenants our operating segments consist of 1 towers and 2 fiber which includes both small cells and fiber solutions our core business is providing access including space or capacity to our shared communications infrastructure via longterm contracts in various forms including lease license sublease and service agreements collectively tenant contracts we seek to increase our site rental revenues by adding more tenants on our shared communications infrastructure which we expect to result in significant incremental cash flows due to our low incremental operating costs we operate as a reit for us federal income tax purposes see item 1 business—reit status and notes 2 and 9 to our consolidated financial statements 

over the last two decades we have assembled a leading portfolio of towers predominately through acquisitions from large wireless carriers or their predecessors more recently both through acquisitions and new construction of small cells and fiber we have extended our communications infrastructure presence by investing significantly in our fiber segment through our product offerings of towers and small cells we seek to provide a comprehensive solution to enable our wireless tenants to expand coverage and capacity for wireless networks furthermore within our fiber segment we seek to generate cash flow growth and stockholder return by deploying our fiber for both small cells and fiber solutions tenants 

approximately 56 and 71 of our towers are located in the 50 and 100 largest us basic trading areas btas respectively our towers have a significant presence in each of the top 100 btas we derive approximately 40 of our towers site rental gross margin from towers located on land that we own including through fee interests and perpetual easements and we derive approximately 60 of our towers site rental gross margin from towers located on land that we lease sublease manage or license the contracts for the land under our towers have an average total remaining life of approximately 36 years including all renewal terms exercisable at our option weighted based on towers site rental gross margin the majority of our small cells and fiber are located in major metropolitan areas including a presence within every major us market the vast majority of our fiber assets are located on public rightsofway 

our largest tenants are tmobile att and verizon wireless which collectively accounted for approximately threefourths of our 2021 consolidated site rental revenues see note 14 to our consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our largest tenants site rental revenues represented 90 of our 2021 consolidated net revenues of which 67 and 33 were from our towers segment and our fiber segment respectively within our fiber segment 69 and 31 of our 2021 fiber site rental revenues related to fiber solutions and small cells respectively the vast majority of our site rental revenues are of a recurring nature and are derived from longterm tenant contracts with our tenants 

our site rental revenues derived from wireless tenants typically result from longterm tenant contracts with 1 initial terms of five to 15 years 2 multiple renewal periods of five to 10 years each exercisable at the option of the tenant 3 limited termination rights for our tenants and 4 monthly rental payments with contractual escalations of the rental price and in some cases an additional upfront payment our site rental revenues derived from our fiber solutions tenants including from organizations with highbandwidth and multilocation demands typically result from tenant contracts with 1 initial terms that generally vary between three to 20 years and 2 a fixed monthly recurring fee and in some cases an additional upfront payment as of december 31 2021 exclusive of renewals exercisable at the tenants option our tenant contracts had a weightedaverage remaining life of approximately five years and represented 31 billion of expected future cash inflows 

as part of our effort to provide comprehensive communications infrastructure solutions as an ancillary business we also offer certain services primarily relating to our towers segment predominately consisting of 1 site development services primarily relating to existing or new tenant equipment installations including site acquisition architectural and engineering or zoning and permitting collectively site development services and 2 tenant equipment installation or subsequent augmentations collectively installation services 

strategy 

as a leading provider of shared communications infrastructure in the us our strategy is to create longterm stockholder value via a combination of 1 growing cash flows generated from our existing portfolio of communications infrastructure 2 returning a meaningful portion of our cash generated by operating activities to our common stockholders in the form of dividends and 3 investing capital efficiently to grow cash flows and longterm dividends per share our strategy is based in part on our belief that the us is the most attractive market for shared communications infrastructure investment with the greatest longterm growth potential we measure our efforts to create longterm stockholder value by the combined payment of dividends to stockholders and growth in our pershare results the key elements of our strategy are to 

• grow cash flows from our existing communications infrastructure we are focused on maximizing the recurring site rental cash flows generated from providing our tenants with longterm access to our shared infrastructure assets which we believe is the core driver of value for our stockholders tenant additions or modifications of existing tenant equipment collectively tenant additions enable our tenants to expand coverage and capacity in order to meet increasing demand for data while generating high incremental returns for our business we believe our product offerings of towers and small cells provide a comprehensive solution to our wireless tenants growing network needs through our shared communications infrastructure model which is an efficient and costeffective way to serve our tenants additionally we believe our ability to share our fiber assets across multiple tenants to deploy both small cells and offer fiber solutions allows us to generate cash flows and increase stockholder return 

• return cash generated by operating activities to common stockholders in the form of dividends  we believe that distributing a meaningful portion of our cash generated by operating activities appropriately provides common stockholders with increased certainty for a portion of expected longterm stockholder value while still allowing us to retain sufficient flexibility to invest in our business and deliver growth we believe this decision reflects the translation of the highquality longterm contractual cash flows of our business into stable capital returns to common stockholders 

• invest capital efficiently to grow cash flows and longterm dividends per share in addition to adding tenants to existing communications infrastructure we seek to invest our available capital including the net cash generated by our operating activities and external financing sources in a manner that will increase longterm stockholder value on a riskadjusted basis these investments include constructing and acquiring new communications infrastructure that we expect will generate future cash flow growth and attractive longterm returns by adding tenants to those assets over time our historical investments have included the following in no particular order 

◦ construction of towers fiber and small cells 

◦ acquisitions of towers fiber and small cells 

◦ acquisitions of land interests which primarily relate to land assets under towers 

◦ improvements and structural enhancements to our existing communications infrastructure 

◦ purchases of shares of our common stock from time to time and 

◦ purchases repayments or redemptions of our debt 

our strategy to create longterm stockholder value is based on our belief that there will be considerable future demand for our communications infrastructure based on the location of our assets and the rapid growth in the demand for data we believe that such demand for our communications infrastructure will continue will result in growth of our cash flows due to tenant additions on our existing communications infrastructure and will create other growth opportunities for us such as demand for newly constructed or acquired communications infrastructure as described above further we seek to augment the longterm value creation associated with growing our recurring site rental cash flows by offering certain ancillary site development and installation services within our towers segment 

reit status 

we operate as a reit for us federal income tax purposes as a reit we are generally entitled to a deduction for dividends that we pay and therefore are not subject to us federal corporate income tax on our net taxable income that is currently distributed to our stockholders we may be subject to certain federal state local and foreign taxes on our income or assets including 1 taxes on any undistributed income 2 taxes related to our taxable reit subsidiaries trss 3 franchise taxes 4 property taxes and 5 transfer taxes in addition we could under certain circumstances be required to pay an excise or penalty tax which could be significant in amount in order to utilize one or more relief provisions under the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended code to maintain qualification for taxation as a reit for taxable years beginning before 2026 qualified reit dividends within the meaning of section 199ae3 of the code constitute a part of a noncorporate taxpayers qualified business income amount and thus our noncorporate us stockholders may be eligible to take a qualified business income deduction in an amount equal to 20 of such dividends received from us without further legislative action the 20 deduction applicable to qualified reit dividends will expire on january 1 2026 

the vast majority of our assets and revenues are in the reit see notes 2 and 9 to our consolidated financial statements additionally we have included in trss certain other assets and operations those trs assets and operations will continue to be subject as applicable to federal and state corporate income taxes or to foreign taxes in the jurisdictions in which such assets and operations are located 

our foreign assets and operations including our tower operations in puerto rico most likely will be subject to foreign income taxes in the jurisdictions in which such assets and operations are located regardless of whether they are included in a trs 

to remain qualified and be taxed as a reit we will generally be required to annually distribute to our stockholders at least 90 of our reit taxable income after the utilization of our nols determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding net capital gain see notes 2 and 9 to our consolidated financial statements our quarterly common stock dividend will delay the utilization of our nols and may cause certain of the nols to expire without utilization see item 1a risk factors for risks associated with our reit status 

industry overview 

consumer demand for data continues to grow due to increases in data consumption and increased penetration of bandwidthintensive devices this increase in data consumption is driven by factors such as growth in 1 mobile entertainment such as mobile video mobile applications and social networking 2 mobile internet usage supporting web browsing and trends in telehealth remote working online learning and other remote communications 3 machinetomachine applications or the internet of things such as connected cars and smart city technologies and 4 the adoption of other bandwidthintensive applications such as cloud services and video communications as a result consumer wireless devices are trending toward bandwidthintensive devices including smartphones laptops tablets wearables and other emerging and embedded devices and us wireless carriers are among the first carriers in the world to begin offering commercial 5th generation 5g mobile cellular communications services to further support such growth 

we expect the following anticipated factors to contribute to potential demand for our communications infrastructure 

• consumers growing wireless data consumption leading major wireless carriers to upgrade and enhance their networks through the efficient use of both towers and small cells including in connection with 5g deployments in an effort to improve network quality and capacity and customer retention or satisfaction 

• prior and future potential spectrum auctioned licensed or made available by the federal communications commission fcc enabling additional wireless carrier network development 

• nextgeneration technologies and new uses for wireless communications may potentially result in new entrants or increased demand in the wireless industry which may include companies involved in the continued evolution and deployment of the internet of things 

• the continued adoption of bandwidthintensive applications could result in demand for highcapacity multilocation fiberbased network solutions and 

• increased government initiatives to expand broadband infrastructure to support connectivity throughout the us 

the company 

virtually all of our operations in both our towers and fiber operating segments are located in the us for more information about our operating segments see item 7 mda—general overview and note 14 to our consolidated financial statements our core business is providing access including space or capacity to our shared communications infrastructure via longterm tenant contracts in the us we believe our communications infrastructure is integral to our tenants networks and organizations see item 1 business—strategy 

towers segment we believe towers are the most efficient and costeffective solution for providing coverage and capacity for wireless carrier network deployments we acquired ownership interests or exclusive rights to the majority of our towers directly or indirectly from the largest us wireless carriers or their predecessors through transactions consummated since 1999 including transactions with 1 att in 2013 att acquisition 2 tmobile in 2012 tmobile acquisition 3 global signal inc in 2007 global signal acquisition which had originally acquired the majority of its towers from sprint prior to sprints merger with tmobile which was completed in 2020 4 companies now part of verizon wireless in 1999 and 2000 and 5 companies now part of att in 1999 and 2000 

we generally receive monthly rental payments from our towers tenants pursuant to longterm tenant contracts typically we negotiate initial contract terms of five to 15 years with multiple renewal periods of five to 10 years each exercisable at the option of the tenant and our tenant contracts typically include fixed escalations which generally exceed expected nonrenewals as discussed below we strive to negotiate with our existing tenant base for longer contractual terms which often contain fixed escalation rates for example on january 6 2022 we entered into a 12year agreement with tmobile tmobile agreement which includes contracted new tower leasing activity and a base escalator that is consistent with historical levels for our towers segment 

our towers tenant contracts while amended and renegotiated over time have historically led to a longterm relationship with tenants on our towers resulting in a retention rate generally between 98 and 99 each year in general each renewable tenant contract automatically renews at the end of its term unless 1 the tenant provides prior notice of its intent not to renew or 2 the contract is amended or renegotiated see item 1a risk factors for additional information regarding expected higher nonrenewals which we define as the reduction in site rental revenues as a result of tenant churn terminations and in limited circumstances reductions of existing lease rates as a result of the tmobile agreement see note 3 to our consolidated financial statements for a tabular presentation of the minimum rental payments due to us by tenants pursuant to tenant contracts without consideration of tenant renewal options as of december 31 2021 

the average monthly rental payment from a new tenant added to towers can vary based on 1 aggregate tenant volume 2 the location of the tower or 3 the amount of tower and ground space leased to a tenant which can be influenced by the quantity size and weight of the tenants antenna installation or related equipment when possible we seek to receive rental payment increases in connection with tenant contract amendments pursuant to which our tenants add antennas or other equipment to our towers or ground space on which they already have equipment pursuant to preexisting tenant contracts our towers tenant contracts and pricing are not influenced by whether or not we perform the respective site development or installation services see —services below for a further discussion of our tower installation services 

as of december 31 2021 the average number of tenants calculated as a unique license together with any related amendments thereto per tower is approximately 23 the following chart sets forth the number of existing tenants per tower as of december 31 2021 see item 7 mda—accounting and reporting matters—critical accounting policies and estimates for a discussion of our impairment evaluation and our towers with no tenants 

fiber segment our fiber segment includes both small cells and fiber solutions 

• our small cells offload data traffic from towers and bolster our tenants network capacity where data demand is the greatest and are typically attached to public rightofway infrastructure including utility poles and street lights 

• we offer certain fiber solutions to organizations with highbandwidth and multilocation demands our fiber solutions provide essential connectivity resources needed to create integrated networks and support organizations 

our fiber assets include those we acquired from 1 nextg networks inc in 2012 2 quanta fiber networks inc in 2015 3 fpl fibernet holdings llc and certain other subsidiaries of nextera energy inc in 2017 4 wilcon holdings llc in 2017 and 5 lts group holdings llc in 2017 

we generally receive monthly recurring payments from our fiber tenants and in some cases receive upfront payments pursuant to tenant contracts the average monthly rental payment from a new tenant can vary based on the amount or cost of 1 construction for initial and subsequent tenants 2 fiber strand requirements and supply 3 equipment at the site 4 the market in the us where the fiber is located and 5 any upfront payment received the tmobile agreement also includes a contractual commitment by tmobile for 35000 new small cell nodes including specific commitments in each of the next five years 

additional site rental information for both our towers and fiber segments we have existing master agreements with our largest tenants including tmobile att and verizon wireless such agreements provide certain terms including economic terms that govern underlying contracts entered into during the term of the master agreements regarding the right to use our communications infrastructure by such tenants 

approximately half of our site rental cost of operations consists of towers ground lease expenses and the remainder includes fiber access expenses primarily leases of fiber assets and other access agreements to facilitate our communications infrastructure property taxes repairs and maintenance employee compensation or related benefit costs and utilities assuming current leasing activity levels our cash operating expenses generally tend to escalate at approximately the rate of inflation we seek to add tenants to our existing communications infrastructure assets at a low incremental operating cost delivering high incremental returns to our business once constructed our communications infrastructure portfolio requires minimal sustaining capital expenditures including maintenance or other nondiscretionary capital expenditures which are typically approximately 2 of net revenues see note 13 to our consolidated financial statements for a tabular presentation of the rental payments we owe to landlords pursuant to our operating lease agreements 

services as part of our effort to provide comprehensive communications infrastructure solutions as an ancillary business we also offer certain services primarily relating to our towers segment predominately consisting of 1 site development services and 2 installation services for 2021 approximately 40 of our services and other revenues related to 

installation services and the remainder predominately related to site development services we seek to grow our service revenues by capitalizing on 1 increased leasing volumes that may result from carrier network upgrades 2 promoting site development services 3 expanding the scope of our services and 4 focusing on tenant service and deployment speed we have the capability and expertise to install with the assistance of our network of subcontractors equipment or antenna systems for our tenants we do not always provide the installation services or site development services for our tenants on our communications infrastructure as other service providers also provide these services see also —competition below these services are typically nonrecurring and highly competitive with several competitors in most markets typically our site development services and installation services are billed on a fixed fee basis the terms and pricing of both site development services and installation services are negotiated separately from our tenant contracts 

customers our towers customers are primarily comprised of large wireless carriers that operate national networks 

our fiber customers generally consist of large wireless carriers and organizations with highbandwidth and multilocation demands such as enterprise government education healthcare wholesale financial legal media and entertainment content distribution and energy and utilities customers 

our three largest tenants are tmobile att and verizon wireless collectively these three tenants accounted for approximately threefourths of our 2021 site rental revenues  see item 1a risk factors for risks associated with our dependence on a small number of customers and note 14 to our consolidated financial statements for 2021 our site rental revenues by tenant were as follows 

sales and marketing our sales organization markets our communications infrastructure with the objective of contracting access with tenants to existing communications infrastructure or to new communications infrastructure prior to construction we seek to become the critical partner and preferred independent communications infrastructure provider for our tenants and increase tenant satisfaction relative to our peers by leveraging our 1 existing unique communications infrastructure footprint 2 tenant relationships 3 processcentric approach 4 technological tools and 5 construction capabilities and expertise 

our sales team is organized based on a variety of factors including tenant type such as large wireless carriers vertical customers and organizations product offering and geography a team of national account directors maintains our relationships with our largest tenants these directors work to develop new business opportunities as well as to ensure that tenants communications infrastructure needs are efficiently translated into new contracts for our communications infrastructure sales personnel in our local offices develop and maintain relationships with our tenants that are expanding their networks entering new markets seeking new or additional communication infrastructure offerings bringing new technologies to market or requiring maintenance or addon business in addition to our fulltime sales or marketing staff a number of seniorlevel employees spend a significant portion of their time on sales and marketing activities and call on existing or prospective tenants 

competition we face competition for site rental tenants from various sources including 1 other independent communications infrastructure owners or operators including competitors that own operate or manage towers rooftops broadcast or transmission towers utility poles fiber including nontraditional competitors such as cable providers or small cells 2 tenants who elect to selfperform or 3 new alternative deployment methods for communications infrastructure 

some of our largest competitors in the towers segment are american tower corporation and sba communications corporation our fiber segment business competitors can vary significantly based on geography some of the larger competitors in the fiber segment include other owners of fiber as well as recent and potential entrants into small cells and the fiber solutions business we believe that location existing communications infrastructure footprint deployment speed quality of service expertise reputation capacity and price have been and will continue to be the most significant competitive factors affecting our businesses see item 1a risk factors for a discussion of competition in our industry 

competitors to our services offering can include site acquisition consultants zoning consultants real estate firms rightofway consulting firms construction companies tower owners or managers radio frequency engineering consultants our tenants internal staff or contractors or telecommunications equipment vendors who can provide turnkey site development services through multiple subcontractors we believe that our tenants base their decisions on the outsourcing of services on criteria such as a companys experience record of accomplishment reputation price and time for completion of a project 

environmental social and governance esg 

our shared communications infrastructure model results in the use of fewer resources including water energy metals and other materials than would otherwise be needed to construct and maintain communications infrastructure we are committed to operating responsibly and ethically and considering social and environmental impacts as we make business decisions in 2021 we incorporated annual sustainability targets into our senior unsecured credit facility and announced our goal to be carbon neutral by 2025 in scope 1 and 2 emissions by continuing to invest in energy reduction initiatives sourcing renewable energy and to a lesser extent utilizing carbon credits or offsets we plan to continue investing in projects that are both good for our business and good for the environment 

additionally in 2021 our board of directors expanded the responsibilities of the nominating environmental social and governance committee formerly the nominating  corporate governance committee to include assisting the board of directors with esg oversight our executive management team and senior management keep our board of directors apprised of our esg priorities goals and initiatives together our board of directors and executive management team define our strategic approach to managing actual and potential impacts of significant esg risks and opportunities

regulatory and environmental matters 

we are required to comply with a variety of federal state and local regulations and laws in the us including fcc and federal aviation administration faa regulations and those discussed under —environmental below to date we have not incurred any material fines or penalties or experienced any material adverse effects to our business as a result of any domestic or international regulations including any environmental regulations the summary below is based on regulations currently in effect and such regulations are subject to review or modification by the applicable governmental authority from time to time if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations we may be fined or even lose our rights to conduct some of our business 

federal regulations both the fcc and the faa regulate towers used for wireless communications radio or television broadcasting such regulations control the siting construction modification lighting and marking of towers and may depending on the characteristics of particular towers require the registration of tower facilities with the fcc and the issuance of determinations confirming no hazard to air traffic wireless communications devices operating on towers are separately regulated and independently licensed based upon the particular frequency used in addition the fcc and the faa have developed standards to consider proposals for new or modified tower or antenna structures based upon the height or location including proximity to airports proposals to construct or to modify existing tower or antenna structures above certain heights are reviewed by the faa to ensure the structure will not present a hazard to aviation which determination may be conditioned upon compliance with lighting or marking requirements the fcc requires its licensees to operate communications devices only on towers that comply with faa rules and are registered with the fcc if required by its regulations where tower lighting is required by faa regulation tower owners bear the responsibility of notifying the faa of any tower lighting outage and ensuring the timely restoration of such outages 

state and local regulations the us telecommunications act of 1996 amended the communications act of 1934 to preserve state and local zoning authorities jurisdiction over the siting of communications towers and small cells the law however limits state and local zoning authority by prohibiting actions by such authorities that discriminate between different service providers of wireless communications or prohibit altogether actually or effectively the provision of wireless communications additionally the law prohibits state and local restrictions based on the environmental effects of radio frequency emissions to the extent the facilities comply with fcc regulations 

local regulations include city and other local ordinances including subdivision and zoning ordinances approvals for construction modification and removal of towers and small cells and restrictive covenants imposed by community developers these regulations vary greatly but typically require us to obtain prior approval from local officials local zoning authorities may render decisions that prevent the construction or modification of towers or small cells or place conditions on such construction or modifications that are responsive to community residents concerns regarding the height visibility or other characteristics of such infrastructure over the last several years the fcc has adopted regulations and 30 states have passed legislation intended to expedite and streamline the deployment of wireless networks including establishing presumptively reasonable timeframes for reviews by local and state governments notwithstanding such developments decisions of local regulatory authorities and utilities in certain jurisdictions may continue to adversely affect deployment timing and cost 

certain of our subsidiaries hold state authorizations including authorizations to act as competitive local exchange carriers clecs to provide intrastate telecommunication services in addition to fcc authorization to provide domestic interstate telecommunication services state authorizations may help promote access to public rightsofway which is beneficial to the timely deployment of fiber and small cells and often allow us to deploy such infrastructure in locations where zoning restrictions might otherwise delay restrict or prevent building or expanding traditional wireless tower and rooftop sites see item 1a risk factors for additional information regarding rights to our infrastructure 

environmental we are required to comply with a variety of federal state and local environmental laws and regulations protecting environmental quality including air and water quality and wildlife to date we have not incurred any material fines or penalties or experienced any material adverse effects to our business as a result of any domestic or international environmental regulations or matters see item 1a risk factors for additional information regarding compliance with laws and regulations 

the construction of new towers and small cells or in some cases their modification in the us may be subject to environmental review under the national environmental policy act of 1969 as amended nepa which requires federal agencies to evaluate the environmental impact of major federal actions nepa regulations require applicants to investigate the potential environmental impact of the proposed tower or small cells construction if the fcc determines that the proposed tower or small cells construction or modification presents a significant environmental impact the fcc is required to prepare an environmental impact statement which is subject to public comment such determination could significantly delay the fccs approval of the construction or modification 

our operations are also subject to federal state and local laws and regulations relating to the management use storage disposal emission or remediation of or exposure to hazardous or nonhazardous substances materials or wastes as an owner lessee or operator of real property we are subject to certain environmental laws that impose strict jointandseveral liability for the cleanup of onsite or offsite contamination relating to existing or historical operations or we could also be subject to personal injury or property damage claims relating to such contamination in general our tenant contracts prohibit our tenants from using or storing any hazardous substances on our communications infrastructure sites in violation of applicable environmental laws and require our tenants to provide notice of certain environmental conditions caused by them 

we are subject to occupational safety and health administration and similar guidelines regarding employee protection from radio frequency exposure in recent years the scientific community has extensively studied lowlevel radio frequency emissions to determine whether they have any connection to certain negative health effects such as cancer 

we have compliance programs and monitoring projects designed to promote compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations nevertheless there can be no assurance that the costs of compliance with existing or future environmental laws will not have a material adverse effect on us

 item 1a risk factors 

you should carefully consider all of the risks described below as well as the other information contained in this document when evaluating your investment in our securities 

risks relating to our business and industry 

our business depends on the demand for our communications infrastructure driven primarily by demand for data and we may be adversely affected by any slowdown in such demand additionally a reduction in the amount or change in the mix of network investment by our tenants may materially and adversely affect our business including reducing demand for our communications infrastructure or services 

tenant demand for our communications infrastructure depends on consumers and organizations demand for data additionally the willingness of our tenants to utilize our communications infrastructure or renew or extend existing tenant contracts on our communications infrastructure is affected by numerous factors including 

• availability or capacity of our communications infrastructure or associated land interests 

• location of our communications infrastructure 

• financial condition of our tenants including their profitability and availability or cost of capital 

• willingness of our tenants to maintain or increase their network investment or changes in their capital allocation strategy 

• need for integrated networks and organizations 

• availability and cost of spectrum for commercial use 

• increased use of network sharing roaming joint development or resale agreements by our tenants 

• mergers or consolidations by and among our tenants 

• changes in or success of our tenants business models 

• governmental regulations and initiatives including local or state restrictions on the proliferation of communications infrastructure 

• cost of constructing communications infrastructure 

• our market competition including tenants that may elect to selfperform 

• technological changes including those 1 affecting the number or type of communications infrastructure needed to provide data to a given geographic area or which may otherwise serve as a substitute or alternative to our communications infrastructure or 2 resulting in the obsolescence or decommissioning of certain existing wireless networks and 

• our ability to efficiently satisfy our tenants service requirements 

a slowdown in demand for data or our communications infrastructure may negatively impact our growth or otherwise have a material adverse effect on us if our tenants or potential tenants are unable to raise adequate capital to fund their business plans as a result of disruptions in the financial and credit markets or otherwise they may reduce their spending which could adversely affect our anticipated growth or the demand for our communications infrastructure or services 

the amount timing and mix of our tenants network investment is variable and can be significantly impacted by the various matters described in these risk factors changes in tenant network investment typically impact the demand for our communications infrastructure as a result changes in tenant plans such as delays in the implementation of new systems new and emerging technologies including small cells and fiber solutions or plans to expand coverage or capacity may reduce demand for our communications infrastructure furthermore the industries in which our tenants operate particularly those in the wireless industry could experience a slowdown or slowing growth rates as a result of numerous factors including a reduction in consumer demand for data or general economic conditions there can be no assurances that weakness or uncertainty in the economic environment will not adversely impact our tenants or their industries which may materially and adversely affect our business including by reducing demand for our communications infrastructure or services in addition a slowdown may increase competition for site rental tenants or services such an industry slowdown or a reduction in tenant network investment may materially and adversely affect our business 

a substantial portion of our revenues is derived from a small number of tenants and the loss consolidation or financial instability of any of such tenants may materially decrease revenues or reduce demand for our communications infrastructure and services 

our three largest tenants are tmobile  att and verizon wireless the loss of any one of our largest tenants as a result of consolidation merger bankruptcy insolvency network sharing roaming joint development resale agreements by our tenants or otherwise may result in 1 a material decrease in our revenues 2 uncollectible account receivables 3 an impairment of our deferred site rental receivables communications infrastructure assets or intangible assets including goodwill or 4 other adverse effects to our business we cannot guarantee that tenant contracts with our largest tenants will not be terminated or that these tenants will renew their tenant contracts with us in addition to our three largest tenants we also derive a portion of our revenues and anticipated future growth from 1 fiber solutions tenants and 2 new entrants offering or contemplating offering wireless services such tenants including those dependent on government funding may be smaller or have less financial resources than our three largest tenants may have business models which may not be successful or may require additional capital 

consolidation among our tenants will likely result in duplicate or overlapping parts of networks for example where they are coresidents on a tower or small cell network which may result in the termination nonrenewal or renegotiation of tenant contracts and negatively impact revenues from our communications infrastructure due to the longterm nature of our tenant contracts we generally expect that the impact to our site rental revenues from any termination of our tenant contracts as a result of such potential consolidation would be spread over multiple years such consolidation or potential consolidation may result in a reduction or slowdown in such tenants network investment in the aggregate because their expansion plans may be similar tenant consolidation could decrease the demand for our communications infrastructure and services which in turn may result in a reduction in our revenues or cash flows and may trigger a review for impairment of certain longlived assets 

on january 6 2022 we entered into the tmobile agreement we anticipate that the tmobile and sprint network consolidation contemplated in the tmobile agreement will result in higher towers nonrenewals in 2025 which are expected to reduce site rental revenues by approximately 200 million except for full year 2025 we expect our annual towers nonrenewals to remain in line with our historical range of 1 to 2 of annual site rental revenues additionally we anticipate that the tmobile and sprint network consolidation will result in small cell nonrenewals which are expected to reduce site rental revenues by approximately 45 million with the majority occurring in 2023 except for full year 2023 we expect consolidated annual small cell nonrenewals to remain in line with the our historical range of 1 to 2 of annual site rental revenues 

see item 1 business—the company and note 14 to our consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our largest tenants 

the expansion or development of our business including through acquisitions increased product offerings or other strategic growth opportunities may cause disruptions in our business which may have an adverse effect on our business operations or financial results 

we seek to expand and develop our business including through acquisitions increased product offerings such as small cells and fiber solutions or other strategic growth opportunities in the ordinary course of our business we review analyze and evaluate various potential transactions or other activities in which we may engage such transactions or activities could be a complex costly timeconsuming process or cause disruptions in increase risk or otherwise negatively impact our business among other things such transactions and activities may 

• disrupt our business relationships with our tenants depending on the nature of or counterparty to such transactions and activities 

• divert capital and the time or attention of management away from other business operations including as a result of posttransaction integration activities 

• fail to achieve revenue or margin targets operational synergies or other benefits contemplated 

• increase operational risk or volatility in our business 

• not result in the benefits management had expected to realize from such expansion and development activities or those benefits may take longer to realize than expected 

• impact our cost structure and result in the need to hire additional employees 

• increase demands on current employees or result in current or prospective employees experiencing uncertainty about their future roles with us which might adversely affect our ability to retain or attract key employees or 

• result in the need for additional trss or contributions of certain assets to trss which are subject to federal and state corporate income taxes 

our fiber segment has expanded rapidly and the fiber business model contains certain differences from our towers business model resulting in different operational risks if we do not successfully operate our fiber business model or identify or manage the related operational risks such operations may produce results that are lower than anticipated 

in recent years we have allocated a significant amount of capital to our fiber business which is a much less mature business for us than our towers business our fiber segment represented 33 and 34 of our site rental revenues for the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively the business model for our fiber operations contains certain differences from our business model for our towers operations including certain differences relating to tenant base competition contract terms including requirements for service level agreements regarding network performance and maintenance upfront capital requirements landlord demographics deployment and ownership of certain network assets operational oversight requirements government regulations growth rates and applicable laws 

while our fiber operations have certain risks that are similar to our towers operations they also have certain operational risks including the scalability of processes that are different from our towers business including 

• the use of public rightsofway and franchise agreements 

• the use of poles and conduits owned solely by or jointly with third parties 

• risks relating to overbuilding 

• risks relating to the specific markets in which we choose or plan to operate 

• risks relating to construction hazards including boring trenching utility and maintenance of traffic hazards 

• construction management and constructionrelated billings to tenants 

• risks relating to wireless carriers building their own small cell networks or tenants utilizing their own or alternative fiber assets 

• the risk of failing to optimize the use of our finite supply of fiber strands 

• damage to our assets and the need to maintain repair upgrade and periodically replace our assets 

• the risk of failing to properly maintain or operate highly specialized hardware and software 

• network data security risks 

• the risk of new technologies that could enable tenants to realize the same benefits with less utilization of our fiber 

• potential damage to our overall reputation as a communications infrastructure provider and 

• the use of clec status 

in addition the rate at which tenants adopt or prioritize small cells and fiber solutions may be lower or slower than we anticipate or may cease to exist altogether for example our tenants have initially focused on utilizing towers in the first phase of deploying their 5g networks which has led to delays in some of our small cell deployments we anticipate that these delays will be temporary as our tenants plan for the next phase of their 5g network deployment which we believe will require small cells at scale our fiber operations will also expose us to different safety or liability risks or hazards than our towers business as a result of numerous factors including those stemming from the deployment location or nature of the assets involved there may be risks and challenges associated with small cells and fiber solutions being comparatively new and emerging technologies that are continuing to evolve and there may be other risks related to small cells and fiber solutions of which we are not yet aware 

failure to timely efficiently and safely execute on our construction projects could adversely affect our business 

our construction projects and related contracts can be longterm complex in nature dangerous costly and challenging to execute the quality of our performance on such construction projects depends in large part upon our ability to manage 1 the associated tenant relationship and 2 the project itself by timely deploying and properly managing appropriate internal and external project resources in connection with our construction projects we generally bear the risk of cost overruns labor availability and productivity and contractor pricing and performance 

in addition the construction projects including modifications of existing infrastructure can pose certain safety risks including 

• risks resulting from elevated work including falling hazards 

• risks of thirdparty noncompliance with safety regulations industry best practices or other applicable standards 

• risks associated with utility hazards including gas line electrical or sewage strikes which may result in explosions electrocution and other potentially catastrophic events and 

• risk of potential wildfires including due to welding grinding cutting or other construction activity 

such safety risks may cause personal injury or loss of life severe damage to or destruction of property suspension of operations or services or significant damage to the environment creating financial regulatory or reputational damage that could adversely affect our business see our business may be adversely impacted by climaterelated events natural disasters 

including wildfires and other unforeseen events below for additional information regarding potential adverse impacts to our business which may result from wildfires and other climaterelated events 

further investments in newly constructed communications infrastructure may result in lower initial returns compared to returns on our existing communications infrastructure or us not being able to realize future tenant additions at anticipated levels additionally contracts with our tenants for these projects typically specify delivery dates performance criteria and penalties for our failure to perform on occasion we experience unforeseen delays from municipalities and utility companies that result in longer construction timelines than expected which impact our ability to timely deliver on our projects we may also experience unforeseen delays as a result of supply chain disruptions and labor shortages our failure to manage such tenant relationships project resources and project milestones in a timely and efficient manner and appropriately manage safety risks could have a material adverse effect on our business 

new technologies may reduce demand for our communications infrastructure or negatively impact our revenues 

improvements in the efficiency architecture and design of communication networks may reduce the demand for our communications infrastructure for example new technologies and spectrum that may promote network sharing joint development backhaul and fronthaul efficiency or resale agreements by our tenants such as signal combining technologies or network virtualization may reduce the need for our communications infrastructure in addition other technologies such as wifi distributed antenna systems das other small cells blimps satellite such as low earth orbiting and mesh transmission systems may in the future serve as substitutes for or alternatives to leasing on communications infrastructure that might otherwise be anticipated or expected had such technologies not existed in addition new technologies that enhance the range efficiency and capacity of communication equipment could reduce demand for our communications infrastructure any significant reduction in demand for our communications infrastructure resulting from the new technologies may negatively impact our revenues or otherwise have a material adverse effect on us 

if we fail to retain rights to our communications infrastructure including the rights to land under our towers and the rightofway and other agreements related to our small cells and fiber our business may be adversely affected 

the property interests and other rights to our communications infrastructure including the land under our towers are derived from leasehold and subleasehold interests fee interests easements licenses rightsofway and franchise and other agreements a loss of these interests and other rights may interfere with our ability to conduct our business or generate revenues for various reasons we may not always have the ability to access analyze or verify all information regarding titles or other issues prior to acquiring communications infrastructure further we may not be able to renew ground leases or other agreements on commercially viable terms 

our ability to retain rights to the land on which our towers are located depends on our ability to purchase such land by acquiring fee interests and perpetual easements or renegotiate or extend the terms of the agreements relating to such land approximately 10 of our towers site rental gross margin for the year ended december 31 2021 was derived from towers where the leases for the land under such towers had final expiration dates of less than 10 years if we are unable to retain rights to the property on which our communications infrastructure is located our business may be adversely affected 

as of december 31 2021 approximately 53 of our towers were leased or subleased or operated and managed under master leases subleases or other agreements with att and tmobile including agreements assumed by tmobile in connection with its merger with sprint we have the option to purchase these towers at the end of their respective lease terms we have no obligation to exercise such purchase options we may not have the required available capital to exercise our right to purchase some or all of these towers at the time these options are exercisable even if we do have available capital we may choose not to exercise our right to purchase these towers or some or all of the tmobile or att towers for business or other reasons in the event that we do not exercise these purchase rights or are otherwise unable to acquire an interest that would allow us to continue to operate these towers after the applicable period we will lose the cash flows derived from such towers which may have a material adverse effect on our business in the event that we decide to exercise these purchase rights the benefits of the acquisition of these towers may not exceed the costs which could adversely affect our business additional information concerning these towers and the applicable purchase options as of december 31 2021 is as follows 

• 22 of our towers are leased or subleased or operated and managed under a master prepaid lease or other related agreements with att for a weightedaverage initial term of approximately 28 years weighted on towers site rental gross margin we have the option to purchase the leased and subleased towers from att at the end of the respective lease or sublease terms for aggregate option payments of approximately 42 billion which payments if such option is exercised would be due between 2032 and 2048 

• 16 of our towers are leased or subleased or operated and managed for an initial period of 32 years through may 2037 under master leases subleases or other agreements with tmobile which tmobile assumed in connection 

with its merger with sprint we have the option to purchase in 2037 all but not less than all of the leased and subleased towers from tmobile for approximately 23 billion15 of our towers are leased or subleased or operated and managed under a master prepaid lease or other related agreements with tmobile for a weightedaverage initial term of approximately 28 years weighted on towers site rental gross margin we have the option to purchase the leased and subleased towers from tmobile at the end of the respective lease or sublease terms for aggregate option payments of approximately 20 billion which payments if such option is exercised would be due between 2035 and 2049 in addition through the tmobile acquisition another 1 of our towers are subject to a lease and sublease or other related arrangements with att we have the option to purchase these towers that we do not otherwise already own at the end of their respective lease terms for aggregate option payments of up to approximately 405 million which payments if such option is exercised would be due prior to 2032 less than 10 million would be due before 2025 

under master lease or master prepaid lease arrangements we have with att and tmobile including agreements assumed by tmobile in connection with its merger with sprint certain of our subsidiaries lease or sublease or are otherwise granted the right to manage and operate towers from bankruptcy remote subsidiaries of such carriers if one of these bankruptcy remote subsidiaries should become a debtor in a bankruptcy proceeding and is permitted to reject the underlying ground lease our subsidiaries could lose their interest in the applicable sites if our subsidiaries were to lose their interest in the applicable sites or if the applicable ground leases were to be terminated we would lose the cash flow derived from the towers on those sites which may have a material adverse effect on our business we have similar bankruptcy risks with respect to sites that we operate under management agreements 

for our small cells and fiber we must maintain rightsofway franchise pole attachment conduit use fiber use and other agreements to operate our assets for various reasons we may not always have the ability to maintain these agreements or obtain future agreements to construct maintain and operate our fiber assets access to rightsofway may depend on our clec status and we cannot be certain that jurisdictions will 1 recognize such clec status or 2 not change their laws concerning clec access to rightsofway if a material portion of these agreements are terminated or are not renewed we might be forced to abandon our assets which may adversely impact our business in order to operate our assets we must also maintain fiber agreements that we have with public and private entities there is no assurance that we will be able to renew these agreements on favorable terms or at all if we are unable to renew these agreements on favorable terms we may face increased costs or reduced revenues 

additionally in order to expand our communications infrastructure footprint to new locations we often need to obtain new or additional rightsofway and other agreements our failure to obtain these agreements in a prompt and costeffective manner may prevent us from expanding our footprint which may be necessary to meet our contractual obligations to our tenants and could adversely impact our business 

our services business has historically experienced significant volatility in demand which reduces the predictability of our results 

the operating results of our services business for any particular period may experience significant fluctuations given its nonrecurring nature and should not necessarily be considered indicative of longerterm results for this activity our services business is generally driven by demand for our communications infrastructure and may be adversely impacted by various factors including 

• competition 

• the timing mix and amount of tenant network investments 

• the rate and volume of tenant deployment plans 

• unforeseen delays or challenges relating to work performed 

• economic weakness or uncertainty 

• labor availability and productivity 

• our market share and 

• changes in the size scope or volume of work performed 

if radio frequency emissions from wireless handsets or equipment on our communications infrastructure are demonstrated to cause negative health effects potential future claims could adversely affect our operations costs or revenues 

the potential connection between radio frequency emissions and certain negative health effects including some forms of cancer has been the subject of substantial study by the scientific community in recent years we cannot guarantee that claims relating to radio frequency emissions will not arise in the future or that the results of such studies will not be adverse to us 

public perception of possible health risks associated with cellular or other wireless connectivity services and wireless technologies such as 5g may slow or diminish the growth of wireless companies and deployment of new wireless technologies which may in turn slow or diminish our growth in particular negative public perception of and regulations regarding these perceived health risks may slow or diminish the market acceptance of wireless services and technologies if a connection between radio frequency emissions and possible negative health effects were established our operations costs or revenues may be materially and adversely affected we currently do not maintain any significant insurance with respect to these matters 

cybersecurity breaches or other information technology disruptions could adversely affect our operations business and reputation 

despite existing security measures certain of our communications infrastructure may be subject to damage disruptions or shutdowns due to unauthorized access computer viruses ransomware or other malicious software cyberattacks and other security breaches an attack attempt or security breach such as a distributed denial of service attack could potentially result in 1 interruption or cessation of certain of our services to our tenants 2 our inability to meet expected levels of service to our tenants 3 data transmitted over our tenants networks being compromised or misappropriated or 4 business or other sensitive data being compromised or misappropriated although we believe we have a comprehensive incident response plan and other cybersecurity measures and policies in place we cannot guarantee that our security measures will not be circumvented resulting in tenant network failures or interruptions that could impact our tenants network availability and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or operational results additionally security incidents impacting our tenants vendors and business partners could result in a material adverse effect on our business we may be required to expend significant resources to protect against or recover from such threats if an actual or perceived breach of our cybersecurity or information technology occurs the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed and we could lose tenants further the perpetrators of cyberattacks are not restricted to particular groups or persons these attacks may be committed by our employees or external actors operating in any geography in addition our acquisitions both past and future may alter our potential exposure to the risks described above while we maintain insurance that includes coverage in the event of cybersecurity or other information technology breaches there can be no assurances that such coverage will be adequate to cover exposure from such incidents 

our business may be adversely impacted by climaterelated events natural disasters including wildfires and other unforeseen events 

we could be negatively impacted by other unforeseen events such as extreme weather events or natural disasters including as a result of any potential effects of climate change or acts of vandalism there is increasing concern that global climate change is occurring and could result in increased frequency of certain types of natural disasters and extreme weather events although we have implemented a wildfire risk mitigation program the effects of climate change have increased the risk and extent of wildfires that could potentially result from certain of our construction and maintenance projects and other operating activities we cannot predict with certainty the rate at which climate change is occurring or the potential direct or indirect impacts of climate change to our business any such unforeseen events could among other things damage or delay deployment of our communications infrastructure interrupt or delay service to our tenants or could result in legal claims or penalties disruption in operations damage to our reputation negative market perception or costly response measures which could adversely affect our business 

while we currently maintain insurance policies that include coverage in the event of natural disasters and other unforeseen events including possible incidents in which our actions or the actions of those acting on our behalf contribute to such events there can be no assurances that such coverage will be adequate to cover exposure from such events further we do not maintain and do not expect to maintain insurance policies that provide adequate coverage in the event that our actions or those actions of those acting on our behalf contribute to a wildfire event as a result of the fact that such insurance policies are generally not economically available 

the impact of covid19 and related risks could materially affect our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

the global outbreak of covid19 has adversely affected the us in response both the public and private sectors have introduced certain policies and initiatives in an effort to reduce the transmission of covid19 initiatives including the imposition of travel restrictions quarantine or shelterinplace requirements the promotion of social distancing vaccination requirements and the adoption of workfromhome and online learning by companies and institutions in addition the continued spread of covid19 and the resulting initiatives have led to and may continue to lead to business and global supply chain disruptions and volatility in the global capital markets we have modified and might further modify our business practices as a result of the covid19 pandemic the economic and social ramifications of the disease and the societal and governmental responses in the communities in which we operate 

we do not believe that covid19 had a material impact on our financial position results of operations and cash flows for the year ended december 31 2021 the extent to which the covid19 pandemic will affect our business financial position results of operations and cash flows in the future is difficult to predict with certainty and depends on numerous evolving factors including the duration scope and severity of the pandemic the effectiveness of the covid19 vaccine in curbing the spread of the virus the vaccination rates and the impact of the vaccine and testing mandates government social business and other actions that have been and will be taken in response to the pandemic including with respect to mandatory vaccinations and the effect of the pandemic on short and longterm general economic conditions among other things covid19 and the initiatives could 1 adversely affect the availability of our suppliers and vendors or their ability to provide products and services to us 2 result in decreased demand for our communications infrastructure 3 make it more difficult for us to serve our tenants including as a result of delays or suspensions in the issuance of permits or other authorizations needed to conduct our business 4 increase our cost of capital and adversely impact our access to capital and 5 result in difficulty fulfilling our labor needs due to factors beyond our knowledge or control including the duration and severity of covid19 as well as thirdparty actions taken to contain its spread and mitigate its public health effects at this time we cannot estimate or predict with certainty the impact of covid19 the initiatives or the measures we or others take in response thereto on our business financial position results of operations and cash flows particularly over the near to mediumterm but the impact could be material see  item 7 mda—general overview—covid19  for further information 

as a result of competition in our industry we may find it more difficult to negotiate favorable rates on our new or renewing tenant contracts 

our growth is dependent on our entering into new tenant contracts including amendments to tenant contracts upon modification of an existing tower fiber or small cell installation as well as renewing or renegotiating tenant contracts when existing tenant contracts terminate competition in our industry may make it more difficult for us to attract new tenants maintain or increase our gross margins or maintain or increase our market share in addition competition primarily in our fiber solutions business may in certain circumstances cause us to renegotiate certain existing tenant contracts to avoid early contract terminations we face competition for site rental tenants and associated contractual rates from various sources including 1 other independent communications infrastructure owners or operators including those that own operate or manage towers rooftops broadcast or transmission towers utility poles fiber including nontraditional competitors such as cable providers or small cells or 2 new alternative deployment methods for communications infrastructure 

our fiber business generally has different competitors than those in our towers business including other owners of fiber as well as new entrants into small cells and fiber solutions some of which may have larger networks greater financial resources or more experience in managing such assets than we have 

new wireless technologies may not deploy or be adopted by tenants as rapidly or in the manner projected 

there can be no assurances that new wireless services or technologies which may drive demand for our communications infrastructure will be introduced or deployed as rapidly or in the manner projected by the wireless carriers in addition demand or tenant adoption rates for such new technologies may be lower or slower than anticipated for numerous reasons as a result growth opportunities or demand for our communications infrastructure arising from such technologies may not be realized at the times or to the extent anticipated 

risks related to our debt and equity 

our substantial level of indebtedness could adversely affect our ability to react to changes in our business and the terms of our debt instruments limit our ability to take a number of actions that our management might otherwise believe to be in our best interests in addition if we fail to comply with our covenants our debt could be accelerated 

we have a substantial amount of indebtedness approximately 207 billion as of february 18 2022 see item 7 mda—liquidity and capital resources for a tabular presentation of our contractual debt maturities as a result of our substantial indebtedness 

• we may be more vulnerable to general adverse economic or industry conditions 

• we may find it more difficult to obtain additional financing to fund discretionary investments or other general corporate requirements or to refinance our existing indebtedness 

• we are or will be required to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to the payment of principal or interest on our debt thereby reducing the available cash flows to fund other projects including the discretionary investments discussed in item 1 business and item 7 mda—liquidity and capital resources  

• we may have limited flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business or in the industry 

• we may have a competitive disadvantage relative to other companies in our industry with less debt 

• we may be adversely impacted by changes in interest rates 

• we may be adversely impacted by changes to credit ratings related to our debt instruments 

• we may be required to issue equity securities or securities convertible into equity or sell some of our assets possibly on unfavorable terms in order to meet payment obligations 

• we may be limited in our ability to take advantage of strategic business opportunities including communications infrastructure development or mergers and acquisitions and 

• we could fail to remain qualified for taxation as a reit due to limitations on our ability to declare and pay dividends to stockholders as a result of restrictive covenants in our debt instruments 

currently we have debt instruments in place that limit in certain circumstances our ability to incur additional indebtedness pay dividends create liens sell assets or engage in certain mergers and acquisitions among other things in addition the credit agreement credit agreement governing our senior unsecured credit facility which consists of our senior unsecured term loan a facility and senior unsecured revolving credit facility collectively 2016 credit facility contains financial maintenance covenants our ability to comply with these covenants or to satisfy our debt obligations will depend on our future operating performance if we violate the restrictions in our debt instruments or fail to comply with our financial maintenance covenants we will be in default under those instruments which in some cases would cause the maturity of a substantial portion of our longterm indebtedness to be accelerated furthermore if the limits on our ability to pay dividends prevent us from satisfying our reit distribution requirements we could fail to remain qualified for taxation as a reit if these limits do not jeopardize our qualification for taxation as a reit but nevertheless prevent us from distributing 100 of our reit taxable income we will be subject to federal and state corporate income taxes and potentially a nondeductible excise tax on our undistributed taxable income if our operating subsidiaries were to default on their debt the trustee could seek to foreclose the collateral securing such debt in which case we could lose the communications infrastructure and the associated revenues see item 7 mda—liquidity and capital resources—debt covenants for a further discussion of our debt covenants 

ccic is a holding company that conducts all of its operations through its subsidiaries accordingly ccics sources of cash to pay interest or principal on its outstanding indebtedness are distributions relating to its respective ownership interests in its subsidiaries from the net earnings and cash flows generated by such subsidiaries or from proceeds of debt or equity offerings earnings and cash flows generated by ccics subsidiaries are first applied by such subsidiaries to conduct their operations including servicing their respective debt obligations after which any excess cash flows generally may be paid to ccic in the absence of any special conditions such as a continuing event of default however ccics subsidiaries are legally distinct from the holding company and unless they guarantee such debt have no obligation to pay amounts due on their debt or to make funds available to us for such payment 

we have a substantial amount of indebtedness in the event we do not repay or refinance such indebtedness we could face substantial liquidity issues and might be required to issue equity securities or securities convertible into equity securities or sell some of our assets to meet our debt payment obligations 

we have a substantial amount of indebtedness which upon final maturity we will need to refinance or repay see item 7 mda—liquidity and capital resources for a tabular presentation of our contractual debt maturities there can be no assurances we will be able to refinance our indebtedness 1 on commercially reasonable terms 2 on terms including with respect to interest rates as favorable as our current debt or 3 at all 

economic conditions and the credit markets have historically experienced and may continue to experience periods of volatility uncertainty or weakness that could impact 1 the availability or cost of debt financing including any refinancing of the obligations described above 2 our ability to draw the full amount of our 50 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility under our 2016 credit facility 2016 revolver that as of february 18 2022 has 50 billion of undrawn availability or 3 our ability to issue the full amount of the 10 billion commercial paper notes commercial paper notes under our unsecured commercial paper program cp program that as of february 18 2022 had 866 million outstanding 

borrowings under our 2016 credit facility generally bear an interest rate based on libor per annum plus a credit spread based on our senior unsecured credit rating in july 2017 the united kingdoms financial conduct authority fca which regulates libor announced that after 2021 it will stop compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of libor in march 2021 the administrator of libor announced its intention to cease the publication of 1 all nonus dollar libor settings and the oneweek and twomonth us dollar libor settings on december 31 2021 and 2 the remaining us dollar libor settings after june 30 2023 further the use of us dollar libor will not be allowed in most new contracts entered into after december 31 2021 our credit agreement includes hardwired libor transition provisions consistent with those published by the alternative reference rate committee arrc although the arrc has identified the secured overnight financing rate sofr as the recommended alternative rate for us dollar libor and has formally recommended the cme groups forwardlooking sofr term rates there is not yet a generally accepted methodology for adjusting sofr while interest rates on our 2016 credit facility were not impacted by the libor settings that ceased publication on december 31 2021 we are evaluating the potential impact of the libor replacement including in the event of any amendment to our 2016 

credit facility and we cannot predict with certainty what such replacement rate would be what other reforms could be implemented in the future or the potential effect of these changes and the establishment of alternative reference rates on our business the discontinuation reform or replacement of libor could result in interest rate increases on our 2016 credit facility which could adversely affect our cash flows and operating results 

if we are unable to repay or refinance our debt we cannot guarantee that we will be able to generate enough cash flows from operations or that we will be able to obtain enough capital to service our debt fund our planned capital expenditures or pay future dividends in such an event we could face substantial liquidity issues and might be required to issue equity securities or securities convertible into equity securities or sell some of our assets to meet our debt payment obligations failure to repay or refinance indebtedness when required could result in a default under such indebtedness if we incur additional indebtedness any such indebtedness could exacerbate the risks described above 

sales or issuances of a substantial number of shares of our common stock or securities convertible into shares of our common stock may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

future sales or issuances of common stock or other equity related securities may adversely affect the market price of our common stock including any shares of our common stock issued to finance capital expenditures finance acquisitions or repay debt our business strategy contemplates access to external financing to fund certain discretionary investments which may include issuances of common stock or other equity related securities we maintain an atthemarket stock offering program 2021 atm program through which we may from time to time issue and sell shares of our common stock having an aggregate gross sales price of up to 750 million to or through sales agents as of february 18 2022 we had approximately 750 million of gross sales of common stock remaining under our 2021 atm program from time to time we may refresh or implement a new atthemarket stock offering program see note 10 to our consolidated financial statements as of february 18 2022 we had approximately 432 million shares of common stock outstanding 

we have reserved approximately 7 million of common stock for issuance in connection with awards granted under our stock compensation plan 

further a small number of common stockholders own a significant percentage of our outstanding common stock if any one of these common stockholders or any group of our common stockholders sells a large quantity of shares of our common stock or the public market perceives that existing common stockholders might sell a large quantity of shares of our common stock the market price of our common stock may significantly decline 

certain provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation charter amended and restated bylaws bylaws and operative agreements and domestic and international competition laws may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us or for us to acquire control of a third party even if such a change in control would be beneficial to our stockholders 

we have a number of antitakeover devices in place that will hinder takeover attempts or may reduce the market value of our common stock our antitakeover provisions include 

• the authority of the board of directors to issue preferred stock without approval of the holders of our common stock 

• advance notice and other procedural requirements relating to director nominations or proposals submitted by stockholders for actions to be taken at annual meetings and 

• provisions that the state courts or in certain circumstances the federal courts in delaware shall be the sole and exclusive forum for certain actions involving us our directors officers employees and stockholders and unless the company otherwise consents that the federal courts shall be the sole and exclusive forum for resolution of claims arising under the securities act of 1933 as amended “securities act” since the securities act provides that federal and state courts have concurrent jurisdiction over lawsuits brought pursuant to the securities act there may be uncertainty as to whether a court would enforce such a provision stockholders will not be deemed to have waived compliance with the federal securities laws and this provision does not apply to claims for which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction such as under the exchange act 

our bylaws permit special meetings of the stockholders to be called only upon the request of our chief executive officer or a majority of the board of directors and deny stockholders the ability to call such meetings such provisions as well as the provisions of section 203 of the delaware general corporation law may impede a merger consolidation takeover or other business combination or discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us 

in addition domestic or international competition laws may prevent or discourage us from acquiring communications infrastructure in certain geographical areas or impede a merger consolidation takeover or other business combination or discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us 

risks relating to corporate compliance 

if we fail to comply with laws or regulations which regulate our business and which may change at any time we may be fined or even lose our right to conduct some of our business 

a variety of federal state local and foreign laws and regulations apply to our business including those discussed in item 1 business failure to comply with applicable requirements may lead to civil or criminal penalties require us to assume indemnification obligations or breach contractual provisions we cannot guarantee that existing or future laws or regulations including federal state local or foreign tax laws will not adversely affect our business including our reit status increase delays or result in additional costs we also may incur additional costs as a result of liabilities under applicable laws and regulations such as those governing environmental and safety matters these factors may have a material adverse effect on us 

risks relating to our reit status 

future dividend payments to our stockholders will reduce the availability of our cash on hand available to fund future discretionary investments and may result in a need to incur indebtedness or issue equity securities to fund growth opportunities in such event the then current economic credit market or equity market conditions will impact the availability or cost of such financing which may hinder our ability to grow our per share results of operations 

during each of the first three quarters of 2021 we paid a common stock dividend of 133 per share totaling approximately 17 billion in october 2021 our board of directors declared a quarterly common stock dividend of 147 per share which represents an increase of 11 from the quarterly common stock dividend declared during each of the first three quarters of 2021 we currently expect our common stock dividends over the next 12 months to be a cumulative amount of at least 588 per share or an aggregate amount of approximately 25 billion over time we expect to increase our dividend per share generally commensurate with our realized growth in cash flows any future dividends are subject to declaration by our board of directors see notes 10 and 17 to our consolidated financial statements 

we operate as a reit for us federal income tax purposes to remain qualified and be taxed as a reit we will generally be required to annually distribute at least 90 of our reit taxable income determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction excluding net capital gain and after the utilization of any available nols to our stockholders our quarterly cash common stock dividend will delay the utilization of our nols and may cause certain of the nols to expire without utilization see also item 1 business—reit status and item 7 mda—general overview—common stock dividend 

as discussed in item 1 mda—business—strategy we seek to invest our available capital including the net cash generated by our operating activities and external financing sources in a manner that we believe will increase longterm stockholder value on a riskadjusted basis our historical discretionary investments have included the following in no particular order construction of communications infrastructure acquisitions of communications infrastructure acquisitions of land interests which primarily relate to land assets under towers improvements and structural enhancements to our existing communications infrastructure purchases of shares of our common stock from time to time and purchases repayments or redemptions of our debt external financing including debt equity and equityrelated issuances to fund future discretionary investments either 1 may not be available to us or 2 may not be accessible by us at terms that would result in the investment of the net proceeds raised yielding incremental growth in our per share operating results as a result future dividend payments may hinder our ability to grow our per share results of operations or otherwise adversely affect our ability to execute our business plan 

remaining qualified to be taxed as a reit involves highly technical and complex provisions of the code failure to remain qualified as a reit would result in our inability to deduct dividends to stockholders when computing our taxable income which would reduce our available cash 

as a reit we are generally entitled to a deduction for dividends that we pay and therefore are not subject to us federal corporate income tax on our net taxable income that is currently distributed to our common stockholders 

while we intend to operate so that we remain qualified as a reit given the highly complex nature of the rules governing reits the importance of ongoing factual determinations the possibility of future changes in our circumstances and the potential impact of future changes to laws and regulations impacting reits no assurance can be given that we will qualify as a reit for any particular year 

in addition the present us federal tax treatment of reits is subject to change possibly with retroactive effect by legislative judicial or administrative action at any time and any such change might adversely affect our reit status or benefits we cannot predict the impact if any that such changes if enacted might have on our business however it is possible that such changes could adversely affect our business including our reit status 

if in any taxable year we fail to qualify for taxation as a reit and are not entitled to relief under certain provisions of the code then 

• we will not be allowed a deduction for dividends paid to stockholders in computing our taxable income 

• we will be subject to federal and state income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate tax rates and for years beginning before january 1 2018 any applicable alternative minimum tax and 

• we would be disqualified from reelecting reit status for the four taxable years following the year during which we were so disqualified 

although we may have federal nols available to reduce any taxable income to the extent our federal nols have been utilized or are otherwise unavailable any such corporate tax liability could be substantial would reduce the amount of cash available for other purposes and might necessitate the borrowing of additional funds or the liquidation of some investments to pay any additional tax liability accordingly funds available for investment would be reduced 

under the code for taxable years beginning in or after 2018 no more than 20 of the value of the assets of a reit may be represented by securities of one or more trss these limitations may affect our ability to make additional investments in nonreit qualifying operations or assets or in any operations held through trss the net income of our trss is not required to be distributed to us and income that is not distributed to us generally will not be subject to the reit income distribution requirement however there may be limitations on our ability to accumulate earnings in our trss and the accumulation or reinvestment of significant earnings in our trss could result in adverse tax treatment in particular if the accumulation of cash in our trss causes the fair market value of our securities in our trss to exceed current or future limitations of the fair market value of our assets at the end of any quarter then we may fail to remain qualified as a reit 

complying with reit requirements including the 90 distribution requirement may limit our flexibility or cause us to forgo otherwise attractive opportunities including certain discretionary investments and potential financing alternatives 

to remain qualified and be taxed as a reit we are required to satisfy the 90 distribution requirement as described above we commenced declaring regular quarterly dividends to our common stockholders beginning with the first quarter of 2014 see notes 10 and 17 to our consolidated financial statements any such dividends however are subject to the determination of and declaration by our board of directors based on thencurrent and anticipated future conditions including our earnings net cash generated by operating activities capital requirements financial condition our relative market capitalization our existing federal nols of approximately 15 billion or other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors 

to the extent that we satisfy the 90 distribution requirement but distribute less than 100 of our reit taxable income determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction excluding net capital gain and after the utilization of any available nols we will be subject to federal corporate income tax on our undistributed taxable income in addition we will be subject to a 4 nondeductible excise tax if the actual amount that we pay out to our stockholders for a calendar year is less than a minimum amount specified under the code 

from time to time we may generate reit taxable income greater than our cash flow as a result of differences in timing between the recognition of taxable income and the actual receipt of cash or the effect of nondeductible capital expenditures the creation of reserves or required debt or amortization payments if we do not have other funds available in these situations we could be required to borrow funds on unfavorable terms sell assets at disadvantageous prices or distribute amounts that would otherwise be invested in future acquisitions to make distributions sufficient to enable us to pay out enough of our taxable income to satisfy the reit dividend requirement and to avoid corporate income tax and the 4 excise tax in a particular year these alternatives could increase our costs or reduce our equity thus compliance with the reit requirements may hinder our ability to grow which could adversely affect the value of our common stock furthermore the reit dividend requirements may increase the financing we need to fund capital expenditures future growth or expansion initiatives which would increase our total leverage 

in addition to satisfying the 90 distribution requirement to remain qualified as a reit for tax purposes we are required to continually satisfy tests concerning among other things the sources of our income the nature and diversification of our assets and the ownership of our capital stock compliance with these tests will require us to refrain from certain activities and may hinder our ability to make certain attractive investments including the purchase of nonqualifying assets the expansion of nonreal estate activities or investments in the businesses to be conducted by our trss and to that extent limit our 

opportunities and our flexibility to change our business strategy furthermore acquisition opportunities in domestic or international markets may be adversely affected if we need or require the target company to comply with some reit requirements prior to completing any such acquisition in addition our status as a reit may result in investor pressures not to pursue growth opportunities that are not immediately accretive 

moreover if we fail to comply with certain asset ownership tests at the end of any calendar quarter we must correct the failure within 30 days after the end of the calendar quarter or qualify for certain statutory relief provisions to avoid losing our reit qualification as a result we may be required to liquidate assets in adverse market conditions or forgo otherwise attractive investments these actions may reduce our income and amounts available for distribution to our stockholders 

reit related ownership limitations and transfer restrictions may prevent or restrict certain transfers of our capital stock 

in order for us to continue to satisfy the requirements for reit qualification our capital stock must be beneficially owned by 100 or more persons during at least 335 days of a taxable year of 12 months or during a proportionate part of a shorter taxable year also not more than 50 of the value of the outstanding shares of our capital stock may be owned directly or indirectly by five or fewer individuals as defined in the code to include certain entities such as private foundations during the last half of a taxable year in order to facilitate compliance with the reit rules our charter includes provisions regarding reitrelated ownership limitations and transfer restrictions that generally prohibit any person as defined in our charter from beneficially or constructively owning or being deemed to beneficially or constructively own by virtue of the attribution provisions of the code more than 1 98 by value or number of shares whichever is more restrictive of the outstanding shares of our common stock or 2 98 in aggregate value of the outstanding shares of all classes and series of our capital stock in addition our charter provides for certain other ownership limitations and transfer restrictions under applicable constructive ownership rules any shares of capital stock owned by certain affiliated owners generally would be added together for purposes of the ownership limitations these ownership limitations and transfer restrictions could have the effect of delaying deferring or preventing a transaction or a change in control of our company that might involve a premium price for our capital stock or otherwise might be in the best interest of our stockholders

covid19 

during the covid19 pandemic and in accordance with the us department of homeland security guidance issued in march 2020 designating telecommunications infrastructure and networks as critical infrastructure we have continued our operations to ensure the viability of communications networks which are essential to public health and safety in response to the pandemic we have taken a variety of measures to ensure the availability of our critical infrastructure promote the health and safety of our employees and support the communities in which we operate these measures included requiring workfromhome arrangements for a large portion of our workforce imposing travel restrictions for our employees where practicable canceling physical participation in certain meetings events and conferences forming an internal committee to monitor and implement procedures for the return of our workforce to an office setting and other modifications to our business practices we have reopened our offices during the first quarter of 2022 

we will continue to actively monitor the situation and may take further actions as may be required by governmental authorities as advised by public health officials or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees tenants business partners and stockholders see  item 1a risk factors  for further information 

we do not believe that covid19 had a material impact on our financial position results of operations and cash flows for the year ended december 31 2021 given our access to various sources of liquidity and no near term debt maturities other than commercial paper notes and principal payments on amortizing debt we currently anticipate that we will be able to maintain sufficient liquidity as we manage through the current environment see also item 1a risk factors and item 7 mda—liquidity and capital resources—liquidity position 

results of operations 

the following discussion of our results of operations for 2021 compared to 2020 should be read in conjunction with item 1 business item 7 mda—liquidity and capital resources and our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our results of operations and financial condition for 2020 compared to 2019 that is not included in this 2021 form 10k see part ii item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in our annual report on form 10k for the year ended december 31 2020 which was filed with the sec on february 22 2021  

the following discussion of our results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with gaap which require us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts see item 7 mda—accounting and reporting matters—critical accounting policies and estimates and note 2 to our consolidated financial statements see item 7 mda—accounting and reporting matters—nongaap and segment financial measures for a discussion of our use of 1 segment site rental gross margin 2 segment services and other gross margin 3 segment operating profit including their respective definitions and 4 adjusted ebitda including its definition and a reconciliation to net income

2021 and 2020 

total site rental revenues for 2021 grew by 399 million or 8 from 2020 this increase was predominately comprised of the factors depicted in the chart below 

in millions of dollars 

a includes amortization of upfront payments received from longterm tenants and other deferred credits commonly referred to as prepaid rent 

b represents the contribution from recent acquisitions until the oneyear anniversary of the acquisition 

towers site rental revenues for 2021 were 38 billion and increased by 307 million or 9 from approximately 35 billion during 2020 the increase in towers site rental revenues was impacted by the following items inclusive of straightline accounting tenant additions across our entire portfolio renewals or extensions of tenant contracts escalations and nonrenewals of tenants contracts tenant additions were influenced by our tenants ongoing efforts to improve network quality and capacity 

fiber site rental revenues for 2021 were 19 billion and increased by 92 million or 5 from 18 billion from 2020 the increase in fiber site rental revenues was predominately impacted by the increased demand for small cells and fiber solutions increased demand for small cells was driven by our tenants network strategy in an effort to provide capacity and relieve network congestion and increased demand for fiber solutions was driven by increasing demand for data 

the increase in towers site rental gross margin from 2020 to 2021 was related to the previouslymentioned 9 increase in towers site rental revenues and relatively fixed costs to operate our towers the increase in fiber site rental gross margins was predominately related to the previouslymentioned 5 increase in fiber site rental revenues 

towers services and other gross margin for 2021 was 187 million and increased by 116 million or 163 from 71 million during 2020 which is a reflection of the increased volume of activity from carriers network enhancements and the volume and mix of services and other work revenues from our services and other offerings are of a variable nature as these revenues are not under longterm contracts 

towers operating profit for 2021 increased by 393 million or 15 from 2020 the increase in towers operating profit was primarily related to the previouslymentioned increase in towers site rental gross margin and the previouslymentioned increase in towers services and other gross margin 

fiber operating profit for 2021 decreased by 276 million or 20 from 2020 the decrease in fiber operating profit was primarily caused by the absence of 362 million of operating income recognized from the sprint cancellation in 2020 partially offset by the previouslymentioned growth in our fiber site rental revenues 

depreciation amortization and accretion was approximately 16 billion for 2021 and increased by 36 million or 2 from 2020 this increase predominately resulted from a corresponding increase in our gross property and equipment due to capital expenditures 

asset writedown charges for 2021 decreased by 53 million from 2020 asset writedown charges in 2020 included the writeoff of approximately 63 million in property and equipment which following the sprint cancellation we deemed to have no alternative future use 

interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs were 657 million for 2021 and decreased by 32 million or 5 from 689 million during 2020 the decrease predominately resulted from a reduction in the weightedaverage interest rate on our debt as a result of our refinancing activities see note 7 to our consolidated financial statements and item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for a further discussion of our debt 

as a result of repaying certain of our indebtedness in conjunction with our refinancing activities we incurred losses on retirement of longterm obligations of 145 million and 95 million for the years ended 2021 and 2020 respectively see note 7 to our consolidated financial statements 

the provisions for income taxes for 2021 and 2020 were 21 million and 20 million respectively for both 2021 and 2020 the effective tax rate differs from the federal statutory rate predominately due to our reit status including the dividends paid deduction see item 1 business—reit status item 7 mda—accounting and reporting matters—critical accounting policies and estimates and note 9 to our consolidated financial statements 

income from continuing operations was 12 billion during 2021 compared to 11 billion during 2020 the increase was related to 1 growth in our site rental activities in both our towers and fiber segments 2 the previouslymentioned increase in towers services activity and 3 the previouslymentioned decrease in interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs partially offset by i the previouslymentioned losses on retirement of longterm obligations and ii an increase in depreciation amortization and accretion 

loss from discontinued operations net of tax was 62 million during 2021 due to the ato settlement see note 9 to our consolidated financial statements 

net income attributable to ccic stockholders increased by 40 million or 4 from 2020 to 2021 the increase was due to the previouslymentioned increase in income from continuing operations partially offset by the previouslymentioned loss from discontinued operations net of tax 

adjusted ebitda increased 110 million or 3 from 2020 to 2021 the increase was predominately related to the growth in our site rental activities in both our towers and fiber segments as well as the previouslymentioned increase in towers service activity partially offset by the absence of the other operating income recognized in 2020 related to the sprint cancellation 

liquidity and capital resources 

overview 

general our core business generates revenues under longterm tenant contracts see item 1 business—overview and item 7 mda—general overview—overview  from 1 the largest us wireless carriers and 2 fiber solutions tenants as a leading provider of shared communications infrastructure in the us our strategy is to create longterm stockholder value via a combination of 1 growing cash flows generated from our portfolio of communications infrastructure 2 returning a meaningful portion of our cash generated by operating activities to our stockholders in the form of dividends and 3 investing capital efficiently to grow cash flows and longterm dividends per share our strategy is based in part on our belief that the us is the most attractive market for shared communications infrastructure investment with the greatest longterm growth potential we measure our efforts to create longterm stockholder value by the combined payment of dividends to stockholders and growth in our per share results see item 1 business—strategy for a further discussion of our strategy 

we have engaged and expect to continue to engage in discretionary investments that we believe will maximize longterm stockholder value our historical discretionary investments include in no particular order constructing communications infrastructure acquiring communications infrastructure acquiring land interests which primarily relate to land assets under towers improving and structurally enhancing our existing communications infrastructure purchasing shares of our common stock and purchasing repaying or redeeming our debt we have recently spent and expect to continue to spend a significant percentage of our discretionary investments on the construction of small cells and fiber we seek to fund our discretionary investments with both net cash generated by operating activities and cash available from financing capacity such as the use of our undrawn availability from the 2016 revolver issuances under our cp program debt financings and issuances of equity or equityrelated securities including under our 2021 atm program 

we seek to maintain a capital structure that we believe drives longterm stockholder value and optimizes our weightedaverage cost of capital we target a leverage ratio of approximately five times adjusted ebitda subject to various factors such as the availability and cost of capital and the potential longterm return on our discretionary investments we may choose to increase or decrease our leverage from this target for various periods of time we have no significant contractual debt maturities until 2023 other than commercial paper notes that may be outstanding from time to time and principal payments on certain outstanding debt 

we operate as a reit for us federal income tax purposes we expect to continue to pay minimal cash income taxes as a result of our reit status and our nols see item 1 business—reit status item 7 mda—general overview and note 9 to our consolidated financial statements 

liquidity position the following is a summary of our capitalization and liquidity position as of december 31 2021 see item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk and note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our debt as well as note 10 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our 2021 atm program

summary cash flows information   

 

a see note 9 to our consolidated financial statements for further information 

operating activities the decrease in net cash provided by operating activities of 266 million for 2021 from 2020 was due primarily to 1 payment received as a result of the sprint cancellation in 2020 and 2 a net decrease from changes in working capital offset by growth in our core business changes in working capital contribute to variability in net cash provided by operating activities largely due to the timing of advanced payments by us and advanced receipts from tenants we expect to grow our net cash provided by operating activities in the future exclusive of changes in working capital if we realize expected growth in our core business 

investing activities net cash used for investing activities for 2021 decreased 409 million from 2020 primarily as a result of decreased discretionary capital expenditures in both our towers and fiber segments 

our capital expenditures are categorized as discretionary integration or sustaining as described below 

• discretionary capital expenditures are made with respect to activities which we believe exhibit sufficient potential to enhance longterm stockholder value they primarily consist of expansion or development of communications infrastructure including capital expenditures related to 1 enhancing communications infrastructure in order to add new tenants for the first time or support subsequent tenant equipment augmentations or 2 modifying the structure of a communications infrastructure asset to accommodate additional tenants and construction of new communications infrastructure discretionary capital expenditures also include purchases of land interests which primarily relates to land assets under towers as we seek to manage our interests in the land beneath our towers certain technologyrelated investments necessary to support and scale future customer demand for our communications infrastructure and other capital projects the expansion or development of existing communications infrastructure to accommodate new leasing typically varies based on among other factors 1 the type of communications infrastructure 2 the scope volume and mix of work performed on the communications infrastructure 3 existing capacity prior to installation or 4 changes in structural engineering regulations and standards currently construction of new communications infrastructure is predominately comprised of the construction of small cells and fiber including certain construction projects that may take 18 to 36 months to complete our decisions regarding discretionary capital expenditures are influenced by the availability and cost of capital and expected returns on alternative uses of cash such as payments of dividends and investments 

• integration capital expenditures consist of those capital expenditures made as a result of integrating acquired companies into our business 

• sustaining capital expenditures consist of those capital expenditures not otherwise categorized as discretionary capital expenditures such as 1 maintenance capital expenditures on our communications infrastructure assets that enable our tenants ongoing quiet enjoyment of the communications infrastructure and 2 ordinary corporate capital expenditures 

a summary of our capital expenditures for the last three years is as follows 



a towers segment includes 65 million 113 million and 208 million of capital expenditures incurred during the twelve months ended december 31 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively in connection with tenant installations and upgrades on our towers 

capital expenditures decreased from 2020 to 2021 and were primarily impacted by the completion of certain large fiber expansion projects during 2020 as well as the timing of towers and fiber tenant activity see item 7 mda—general overview—outlook highlights for a discussion of our expectations surrounding 2022 capital expenditures 

financing activities we seek to allocate cash generated by our operations in a manner that will enhance longterm stockholder value which may include various financing activities such as in no particular order 1 paying dividends on our common stock currently expected to total at least 588 per share over the next 12 months or an aggregate amount of approximately 25 billion 2 purchasing our common stock or 3 purchasing repaying or redeeming our debt see item 7 mda—general overview—common stock dividend item 7 mda—liquidity and capital resources—overview and notes 7 10 and 17 to our consolidated financial statements 

in 2021 our financing activities predominately related to the following 

• paying an aggregate of 24 billion in dividends on our common stock 

• issuing 325 billion aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes in february 2021 the net proceeds of which were used to 1 redeem all of the outstanding 5250 senior notes 2 repay a portion of the outstanding commercial paper notes and 3 repay a portion of outstanding borrowings under the 2016 term loan a 

• issuing 750 million aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes in june 2021 the net proceeds of which were used to 1 to repay in full the previously outstanding tower revenue notes series 20151 class c2022 2 to repay outstanding indebtedness under the cp program and 3 for general corporate purposes 

• entering into an amendment to the 2016 credit facility in june 2021 that provided for among other things 1 the extension of the maturity date of the credit facility from june 2024 to june 2026 2 reductions to the interest rate spread and unused commitment fee percentage upon meeting specified annual sustainability targets and increases to the interest rate spread and unused commitment fee percentage upon the failure to meet specified annual sustainability thresholds and 3 the inclusion of hardwired libor transition provisions consistent with those published by the alternative reference rate committee 

in 2020 our financing activities predominately related to the following 

• paying an aggregate of 21 billion in dividends on our common stock 

• paying an aggregate of 85 million in dividends on our previously outstanding 6875 mandatory convertible preferred stock 

• issuing 125 billion aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes in april 2020 the net proceeds of which we used to repay outstanding indebtedness under the 2016 revolver and 

• issuing 25 billion aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes in june 2020 the proceeds of which together with available cash we used to redeem all of the previously outstanding 3400 senior notes 2250 senior notes and 4875 senior notes

atm program we previously maintained a 2018 atm program through which we had the right to issue and sell shares of our common stock having an aggregate gross sales price of up to 750 million to or through sales agents in march 2021 we terminated the formerly outstanding 2018 atm program with the entire gross sales price of 750 million remaining unsold 

in march 2021 we established the 2021 atm program through which we may issue and sell shares of our common stock having an aggregate gross sales price of up to 750 million sales under the 2021 atm program may be made by means of ordinary brokers transactions on the nyse or otherwise at market prices prevailing at the time of sale at prices related to prevailing market prices or subject to our specific instructions at negotiated prices we intend to use the net proceeds from any sales under the 2021 atm program for general corporate purposes which may include 1 the funding of future acquisitions or investments or 2 the repayment or repurchase of any outstanding indebtedness see also note 10 to our consolidated financial statements as of february 18 2022 we had approximately 750 million of gross sales of common stock availability remaining on our 2021 atm program 

mandatory convertible preferred stock in july and august 2020 all of our approximately 2 million shares of 6875 mandatory convertible preferred stock then outstanding were converted into approximately 14 million shares of our common stock at a conversion rate based on the applicable market value of our common stock and subject to certain antidilutive adjustments of 88043 shares of common stock for each share of 6875 mandatory convertible preferred stock see note 10 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the july and august conversions into shares of our common stock 

credit facility see note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our 2016 credit facility as of february 18 2022 there was approximately 50 billion in availability under the 2016 revolver the proceeds of our 2016 revolver may be used for general corporate purposes which may include the financing of capital expenditures the repayment or repurchase of any outstanding indebtedness acquisitions and purchases of our common stock 

commercial paper program see note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our cp program as of february 18 2022 the cp program had 866 million outstanding the proceeds from our commercial paper notes may be used for general corporate purposes which may include the financing of capital expenditures the repayment or repurchase of any outstanding indebtedness acquisitions and purchases of our common stock 

restricted cash  pursuant to the indentures governing certain of our operating companies debt securities all rental cash receipts of the issuers of these debt instruments and their subsidiaries are restricted and held by an indenture trustee the restricted cash in excess of required reserve balances is subsequently released to us in accordance with the terms of the indentures see also note 2 to our consolidated financial statements 

material cash requirements 

the following table summarizes our material cash requirements as of december 31 2021 these material cash requirements relate primarily to our outstanding borrowings or lease obligations for land interests under our towers the debt maturities reflect contractual maturity dates and do not consider the impact of the principal payments that will commence following the anticipated repayment dates of certain debt see footnote b   



a the impact of principal payments that will commence following the anticipated repayment dates of our tower revenue notes is not considered the tower revenue notes have principal amounts of 250 million 700 million and 750 million with anticipated repayment dates in 2023 2025 and 2028 respectively see note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for our definition of and additional information regarding the tower revenue notes 

b if the tower revenue notes are not repaid in full by the applicable anticipated repayment dates the applicable interest rate increases by approximately 5 per annum and monthly principal payments commence using the excess cash flow as defined in the indenture governing the applicable tower revenue notes of the issuers of the tower revenue notes the tower revenue notes are presented based on their contractual maturity dates ranging from 2043 to 2048 and include the impact of an assumed 5 increase in interest rate that would occur following the anticipated repayment dates but exclude the impact of monthly principal payments that would commence using excess cash flow as defined in the indenture governing the applicable tower revenue notes of the issuers of the tower revenue notes the full year 2021 excess cash flow as defined in the indenture governing the applicable tower revenue notes of the issuers of the tower revenue notes was approximately 933 million we currently expect to refinance these notes on or prior to the respective anticipated repayment dates 

c interest payments on the variable rate debt are based on estimated rates currently in effect see item 1a risk factors for additional information about the anticipated discontinuation of libor which may impact the interest rates on our variable rate debt additionally see note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for information regarding potential upward or downward adjustments to the interest rate spread and unused commitment fee percentage on our 2016 credit facility if we achieve specified annual sustainability targets or fail to meet annual sustainability thresholds each annual period presented assumes the downward adjustments in the interest rate spread and unused commitment fee percentage on our 2016 credit facility 

d amounts relate primarily to lease obligations for the land on which our towers are located and are based on the assumption that payments will be made for certain renewal periods exercisable at our option that are reasonably certain to be exercised and excludes our contingent payments for operating leases such as payments based on revenues derived from the communications infrastructure located on the leased asset as such arrangements are excluded from our operating lease liability see note 13 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our operating lease obligations see also the table below summarizing remaining terms to expiration 

the following chart summarizes our rights to the land interests under our towers including renewal terms exercisable at our option as of december 31 2021 as of december 31 2021 the leases for land interests under our towers had an average remaining life of approximately 36 years weighted based on towers site rental gross margin see item 1a risk factors   for a discussion of retaining land interests under our towers 

a inclusive of fee interests and perpetual easements 

b for the year ended december 31 2021 without consideration of the term of the tenant contract 

debt covenants 

our credit agreement contains financial maintenance covenants we are currently in compliance with these financial maintenance covenants and based upon our current expectations we believe we will continue to comply with our financial maintenance covenants in addition certain of our debt agreements contain restrictive covenants that place restrictions on us and may limit our ability to among other things incur additional debt and liens purchase our securities make capital expenditures dispose of assets undertake transactions with affiliates make other investments pay dividends or distribute excess cash flow see note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our debt covenants see also item 1a risk factors for a discussion of compliance with our debt covenants the following are ratios applicable to the financial maintenance covenants under the credit agreement as of december 31 2021 



  

a failure to comply with the financial maintenance covenants would absent a waiver result in an event of default under the credit agreement 

b as defined in the credit agreement 

c applicable solely to the extent that the senior unsecured debt rating by any two of sp moodys and fitch is lower than bbb baa3 or bbb respectively if applicable the consolidated interest coverage ratio must be greater than or equal to 250 

accounting and reporting matters 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our critical accounting policies and estimates are those that we believe 1 are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations or 2 require our most difficult subjective or complex judgments often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain in many cases the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically prescribed by gaap in other cases management is required to exercise judgment in the application of accounting principles with respect to particular transactions accordingly actual results could differ materially from our estimates the critical accounting policies and estimates for 2021 are not intended to be a comprehensive list of our accounting policies and estimates see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for a summary of our significant accounting policies 

lease accounting — lessee for our towers segment our lessee arrangements primarily consist of ground leases for land under our towers ground leases for land are specific to each site and are generally for an initial term of five to 10 years and are renewable and cancelable after a notice period at our option we also enter into term easements and ground leases in which we prepay the entire term for our fiber segment our lessee arrangements primarily include leases of fiber assets to facilitate our small cells and fiber solutions the majority of our lease agreements have certain termination rights that provide for cancellation after a notice period and multiple renewal options exercisable at our option we include certain renewal option periods in the lease term when we determine that the options are reasonably certain to be exercised 

for both our towers and fiber segments operating lease expense is recognized on a ratable basis regardless of whether the payment terms require us to make payments annually quarterly monthly or for the entire term in advance certain of our ground lease and fiber lease agreements contain fixed escalation clauses such as fixed dollar or fixed percentage increases or inflationbased escalation clauses such as those tied to the change in consumer price index cpi if the payment terms include fixed escalator provisions the effect of such increases is recognized on a straightline basis we calculate the straightline expense over the contracts estimated lease term including any renewal option periods that we deem reasonably certain to be exercised 

we recognize a rightofuse rou asset and as applicable a corresponding lease liability for each of our operating leases rou assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the estimated lease term and lease liabilities represent the present value of our future lease payments in assessing our leases and determining our lease liability at lease commencement or upon modification we are not able to readily determine the rate implicit for our lessee arrangements and thus use our incremental borrowing rate on a collateralized basis to determine the present value of our lease payments our rou assets are measured as the balance of the lease liability plus any prepaid or accrued lease payments and any unamortized initial direct costs 

we review the carrying value of our rou assets for impairment similar to our other longlived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable we could record impairments in the future if there are changes in 1 longterm market conditions 2 expected future operating results or 3 the utility of the assets that negatively impact the fair value of our rou assets 

revenue recognition 90 of our total revenue for 2021 consisted of site rental revenues which are recognized on a ratable basis over the fixed noncancelable term of the relevant tenant contract generally ranging from five to 15 years for site rental revenues derived from wireless tenants and three to 20 years for site rental revenues derived from fiber solutions tenants regardless of whether the payments from the tenant are received in equal monthly amounts during the life of a tenant contract certain of our tenant contracts contain 1 fixed escalation clauses such as fixeddollar or fixedpercentage increases or inflationbased escalation clauses such as those tied to the change in cpi 2 multiple renewal periods exercisable at the tenants option and 3 only limited termination rights at the applicable tenants option through the current term if the payment terms call for fixed escalations upfront payments or rentfree periods the revenue is recognized on a straightline basis over the fixed noncancelable term of the tenant contract when calculating our straightline rental revenues we consider all fixed elements of tenant contractual escalation provisions even if such escalation provisions contain a variable element such as an escalator tied to an inflationbased index in addition to a minimum to the extent we acquire belowmarket tenant leases for contractual interests with tenants on the acquired communications infrastructure for example with respect to small cells and fiber we record the fair value as deferred credits and amortize such deferred credits to site rental revenues over their estimated lease term since we recognize revenue on a straightline basis a portion of the site rental revenues in a given period represents cash collected or contractually collectible in other periods our assets related to straightline site rental revenues are included in other current assets and deferred site rental receivables amounts billed or received prior to being earned are deferred and reflected in deferred revenues and other longterm liabilities amounts to which we have an unconditional right to payment which are related to both satisfied or partially satisfied performance obligations are recorded within receivables net on the consolidated balance sheet 

as part of our effort to provide comprehensive communications infrastructure solutions as an ancillary business we also offer certain services primarily relating to our towers segment which represented 10 of our total revenues for 2021 services and other revenue consists predominately of 1 site development services primarily relating to existing or new tenant equipment installations including site acquisition architectural and engineering or zoning and permitting collectively site development services and 2 tenant equipment installation or subsequent augmentations collectively installation services upon contract commencement we assess our services to tenants and identify performance obligations for each promise to provide a distinct service 

we may have multiple performance obligations for site development services which primarily include structural analysis zoning permitting and construction drawings for each of the above performance obligations services revenues are recognized at completion of the applicable performance obligation which represents the point at which we believe we have transferred goods or services to the tenant the revenue recognized is based on an allocation of the transaction price among the performance obligations in a respective contract based on estimated standalone selling price 

the transaction price for tower installation services consists of amounts for 1 permanent improvements to our towers that represent a lease component and 2 the performance of the service amounts under our tower installation services agreements that represent a lease component are recognized as site rental revenues on a ratable basis over the length of the associated estimated lease term for the performance of the tower installation service we have one performance obligation which is satisfied at the time of the applicable installation or augmentation and recognized as services and other revenues 

since performance obligations are typically satisfied prior to receiving payment from tenants the unconditional right to payment is recorded within receivables net on our consolidated balance sheet 

the vast majority of our services revenues relates to our towers segment and generally have a duration of one year or less 

accounting for acquisitions — general as described in item 1 business the majority of our communications infrastructure has been acquired directly or indirectly from the three largest wireless carriers or their predecessors through transactions consummated since 1999 we evaluate each of our acquisitions to determine if it should be accounted for as a business combination or as an acquisition of assets for our business combinations we allocate the purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair value at the date of acquisition any purchase price in excess of the net fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is allocated to goodwill see item 7 mda—accounting and reporting matters—accounting for acquisitions—valuation below 

the determination of the final purchase price allocation could extend over several quarters resulting in the use of preliminary estimates that are subject to adjustment until finalized such changes could have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 

accounting for acquisitions — leases with respect to business combinations that include towers that we lease and operate such as the att and tmobile leased and subleased towers including towers owned by sprint prior to its merger with tmobile we evaluate such agreements to determine treatment as finance or operating leases the evaluation of such agreements for finance or operating lease treatment previously included consideration of each of the lease classification criteria under asc 8401025 namely 1 the transfer of ownership provisions 2 the existence of bargain purchase options 3 the length of the remaining lease term and 4 the present value of the minimum lease payments with respect to the att acquisition tmobile acquisition and the sprint towers acquired in the global signal acquisition we determined that the tower leases were finance leases and the underlying land leases were operating leases based upon the lease term criterion after considering the fragmentation criteria applicable under asc 8401025 to leases involving both land and buildings ie towers we determined that the fragmentation criteria was met and the tower leases could be accounted for as finance leases apart from the land leases which are accounted for as operating leases since 1 the fair value of the land in the aforementioned business combinations was greater than 25 of the total fair value of the leased property at inception and 2 the tower lease expirations occur beyond 75 of the estimated economic life of the tower assets 

accounting for acquisitions — valuation as of december 31 2021 our largest asset was property and equipment which primarily consists of communications infrastructure followed by goodwill operating lease rou assets and intangible assets our identifiable intangible assets predominately relate to the site rental contracts and tenant relationships intangible assets 

the fair value of the vast majority of our assets and liabilities is determined by using either 

1 discounted cash flow valuation methods for estimating identifiable intangibles such as site rental contracts and tenant relationships or operating lease rightofuse assets and lease liabilities acquired or 

2 estimates of replacement costs for tangible fixed assets such as communications infrastructure 

the purchase price allocation requires subjective estimates that if incorrectly estimated could be material to our consolidated financial statements including the amount of depreciation amortization and accretion expense the most important estimates for measurement of tangible fixed assets are 1 the cost to replace the asset with a new asset and 2 the economic useful life after giving effect to age quality and condition the most important estimates for measurement of intangible assets are 1 discount rates and 2 timing and amount of cash flows including estimates regarding tenant renewals and cancellations the most important estimates for measurement of operating lease rou assets and lease liabilities acquired are 1 present value of our future lease payments including whether renewals or extensions should be measured and 2 favorability or unfavorability to the current market terms with respect to business combinations that include towers that we lease and operate such as the att tmobile and sprint prior to sprints merger with tmobile completed on april 1 2020 leased and subleased towers we evaluate such agreements to determine treatment as finance or operating leases and identification of any bargain purchase options 

we record the fair value of obligations to perform certain asset retirement activities including requirements pursuant to our ground leases easements and leased facility agreements to remove communications infrastructure or remediate the space upon which certain of our communications infrastructure resides in determining the fair value of these asset retirement obligations we must make several subjective and highly judgmental estimates such as those related to 1 timing of cash flows 2 future costs 3 discount rates and 4 the probability of enforcement to remove the towers or small cells or remediate the land we do not record an obligation for asset retirement activities related to its fiber as a settlement date is indeterminable and therefore a reasonable estimation of fair value cannot be made 

accounting for longlived assets — useful lives we are required to make subjective assessments as to the useful lives of our tangible and intangible assets for purposes of determining depreciation amortization and accretion expense that if incorrectly estimated could be material to our consolidated financial statements depreciation expense for our property and equipment is computed using the straightline method over the estimated useful lives of our various classes of tangible assets the substantial portion of our property and equipment represents the cost of our communications infrastructure which is generally depreciated with an estimated useful life equal to the shorter of 1 20 years or 2 the term of the lease including optional renewals for the land under our communications infrastructure 

the useful life of our intangible assets is estimated based on the period over which the intangible asset is expected to benefit us and gives consideration to the expected useful life of other assets to which the useful life may relate we review the expected useful lives of our intangible assets on an ongoing basis and adjust if necessary amortization expense for intangible assets is computed using the straightline method over the estimated useful life of each of the intangible assets the useful life of the site rental contracts and tenant relationships intangible assets is limited by the maximum depreciable life of the 

communications infrastructure 20 years as a result of the interdependency of the communications infrastructure and site rental contracts and tenant relationships in contrast the site rental contracts and tenant relationships are estimated to provide economic benefits for several decades because of the low rate of tenant cancellations and high rate of renewals experienced to date thus while site rental contracts and tenant relationships are valued based upon the fair value of the site rental contracts and tenant relationships which includes assumptions regarding both 1 tenants exercise of optional renewals contained in the acquired leases and 2 renewals of the acquired leases past the contractual term including exercisable options the site rental contracts are amortized over a period not to exceed 20 years as a result of the useful life being limited by the depreciable life of the communications infrastructure 

accounting for longlived assets — impairment evaluation we review the carrying values of property and equipment intangible assets or other longlived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable 

for purposes of our towers segment we utilize the following dual grouping policy for purposes of determining the unit of account for testing impairment of the site rental contracts and tenant relationships 

1 we pool site rental contracts and tenant relationships intangible assets and property and equipment into portfolio groups and 

2 we separately pool site rental contracts and tenant relationships by significant tenant or by tenant grouping for individually insignificant tenants as appropriate 

we first pool site rental contracts and tenant relationships intangible assets and property and equipment into portfolio groups for purposes of determining the unit of account for impairment testing because we view communications infrastructure as portfolios and communications infrastructure in a given portfolio and its related tenant contracts are not largely independent of the other communications infrastructure in the portfolio we reevaluate the appropriateness of the pooled groups at least annually this use of grouping is based in part on 1 our limitations regarding disposal of communications infrastructure 2 the interdependencies of communications infrastructure portfolios and 3 the manner in which communications infrastructure is traded in the marketplace the vast majority of our site rental contracts and tenant relationships intangible assets and property and equipment are pooled into the us owned communications infrastructure group secondly and separately we pool site rental contracts and tenant relationships by significant tenant or by tenant grouping for individually insignificant tenants as appropriate for purposes of determining the unit of account for impairment testing because we associate the value ascribed to site rental contracts and tenant relationships intangible assets to the underlying contracts and related tenant relationships acquired 

for purposes of our fiber segment we consider major us markets where we have made significant investments to be the most appropriate level for purposes of grouping our longlived assets for potential impairment evaluation 

our determination that an adverse event or change in circumstance has occurred that indicates that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable will generally involve 1 a deterioration in an assets financial performance compared to historical results 2 a shortfall in an assets financial performance compared to forecasted results or 3 changes affecting the utility and estimated future demands for the asset when considering the utility of our assets we consider events that would meaningfully impact 1 our communications infrastructure or 2 our tenant relationships for example consideration would be given to events that impact 1 the structural integrity and longevity of our communications infrastructure or 2 our ability to derive benefit from our existing tenant relationships including events such as tenants bankruptcy or insolvency or loss of a significant tenant during 2021 there were no events or circumstances that caused us to review the carrying value of our intangible assets or property and equipment due in part to our assets performing consistently with or better than our expectations 

if the sum of the associated estimated future cash flows undiscounted from an asset groups carrying amount is less than its carrying amount an impairment loss may be recognized if the carrying value were to exceed the undiscounted cash flows measurement of an impairment loss would be based on the fair value of the asset which is based on an estimate of discounted future cash flows the most important estimates for such calculations of undiscounted cash flows are 1 the expected additions of new tenants and equipment on our communications infrastructure and 2 estimates regarding tenant cancellations and renewals of tenant contracts we could record impairments in the future if changes in longterm market conditions expected future operating results or the utility of the assets results in changes for our impairment test calculations which negatively impact the fair value of our property and equipment and intangible assets or if we changed our unit of account in the future 

approximately 3 of our total towers currently have no tenants we continue to pay operating expenses on these towers in anticipation of obtaining tenants on these towers in the future primarily because of the demographics and continuing increase in demand for data in the areas around these individual towers we estimate based on current visibility potential tenants on a majority of these towers to the extent we do not believe there are longterm prospects of obtaining tenants on an individual asset and all other possible avenues for recovering the carrying value have been exhausted including sale of the asset we appropriately reduce the carrying value of such assets to fair value 

accounting for goodwill — impairment evaluation we test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis regardless of whether adverse events or changes in circumstances have occurred the annual test begins with goodwill and all intangible assets being allocated to applicable reporting units we then perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount if we conclude that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount we would be required to perform a quantitative goodwill impairment test if the carrying amount of a reporting unit is greater than its fair value an impairment loss shall be recognized in an amount equal to such excess limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit our reporting units are the same as our operating segments towers and fiber see note 14 to our consolidated financial statements we performed our most recent annual goodwill impairment test as of october 1 2021 which resulted in no impairments 

deferred income taxes we operate as a reit for us federal income tax purposes our reit taxable income is generally not subject to federal and state income taxes as a result of the deduction for dividends paid and any usage of our remaining nols accordingly the only provision or benefit for federal income taxes for the year ended december 31 2021 relates to trss furthermore as a result of the deduction for dividends paid some or all of our nols related to our reit may expire without utilization see item 1 business—reit status for a discussion of the impact of our reit status 

our trss will continue to be subject as applicable to federal and state income taxes and foreign taxes in the jurisdictions in which such assets and operations are located our ability to utilize our nols is dependent in part upon us having sufficient future earnings to utilize our nols before they expire if market conditions change materially and we determine that we will be unable to generate sufficient taxable income in the future to utilize our nols we would be required to record an additional valuation allowance which would reduce our earnings such adjustments could cause a material effect on our results of operations for the period of the adjustment the change in our valuation allowance has no effect on our cash flows for a further discussion of our benefit provision for income taxes see item 7 mda—results of operations and note 9 to our consolidated financial statements

nongaap and segment financial measures 

in addition to the nongaap financial measures used herein and as discussed in note 14 to our consolidated financial statements we also provide 1 segment site rental gross margin 2 segment services and other gross margin and 3 segment operating profit which are key measures used by management to evaluate the performance of our operating segments these segment measures are provided pursuant to gaap requirements related to segment reporting 

we define segment site rental gross margin as segment site rental revenues less segment site rental cost of operations which excludes stockbased compensation expense and prepaid lease purchase price adjustments recorded in consolidated site rental cost of operations we define segment services and other gross margin as segment services and other revenues less segment services and other cost of operations which excludes stockbased compensation expense recorded in consolidated services and other cost of operations we define segment operating profit as segment site rental gross margin plus segment services and other gross margin and segment other operating income expense less selling general and administrative expenses attributable to the respective segment all of these measurements of profit or loss are exclusive of depreciation amortization and accretion which are shown separately additionally certain costs are shared across segments and are reflected in our segment measures through allocations that management believes to be reasonable 

we use earnings before interest taxes depreciation amortization and accretion as adjusted adjusted ebitda which is a nongaap financial measure as an indicator of consolidated financial performance our measure of adjusted ebitda may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies including companies in the communications infrastructure sector or other reits and is not a measure of performance calculated in accordance with gaap adjusted ebitda should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for operating income loss income loss from continuing 

operations net income loss net cash provided by used for operating investing and financing activities or other income statement or cash flow statement data prepared in accordance with gaap and should be considered only as a supplement to income loss from continuing operations computed in accordance with gaap as a measure of our performance there are material limitations to using a measure such as adjusted ebitda including the difficulty associated with comparing results among more than one company including our competitors and the inability to analyze certain significant items including depreciation and interest expense that directly affect our net income or loss management compensates for these limitations by considering the economic effect of the excluded expense items independently as well as in connection with their analysis of income loss from continuing operations 

we define adjusted ebitda as income loss from continuing operations plus restructuring charges credits asset writedown charges acquisition and integration costs depreciation amortization and accretion amortization of prepaid lease purchase price adjustments interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs gains losses on retirement of longterm obligations net gain loss on interest rate swaps gains losses on foreign currency swaps impairment of availableforsale securities interest income other income expense benefit provision for income taxes cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle and stockbased compensation expense the reconciliation of adjusted ebitda to our income loss from continuing operations 



a the above reconciliation excludes the items included in our adjusted ebitda definition which are not applicable to the periods shown 

we believe adjusted ebitda is useful to investors or other interested parties in evaluating our financial performance because 

• it is the primary measure used by our management 1 to evaluate the economic productivity of our operations and 2 for purposes of making decisions about allocating resources to and assessing the performance of our operations 

• although specific definitions may vary it is widely used by investors or other interested parties in evaluation of the communications infrastructure sector and other reits to measure financial performance without regard to items such as depreciation amortization and accretion which can vary depending upon accounting methods and the book value of assets 

• we believe it helps investors and other interested parties meaningfully evaluate and compare the results of our operations 1 from period to period and 2 to our competitors by removing the impact of our capital structure primarily interest charges from our outstanding debt and asset base primarily depreciation amortization and accretion from our financial results and 

• it is similar to the measure of current financial performance generally used in our debt covenant calculations 

our management uses adjusted ebitda 

• as a performance goal in employee annual incentive compensation 

• as a measurement of financial performance because it assists us in comparing our financial performance on a consistent basis as it removes the impact of our capital structure primarily interest charges from our outstanding debt and asset base primarily depreciation amortization and accretion from our operating results 

• in presentations to our board of directors to enable it to have the same measurement of financial performance used by management 

• for planning purposes including preparation of our annual operating budget 

• as a valuation measure in strategic analyses in connection with the purchase and sale of assets 

• in determining selfimposed limits on our debt levels including the evaluation of our leverage ratio and interest coverage ratio and 

• with respect to compliance with our debt covenants which require us to maintain certain financial ratios that incorporate concepts such as or similar to adjusted ebitda 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

our primary exposures to market risks are related to changes in interest rates which may adversely affect our results of operations and financial position we seek to manage exposure to changes in interest rates where economically prudent to do so by utilizing fixed rate debt as of december 31 2021 and december 31 2020 we had no interest rate swaps 

our interest rate risk as of december 31 2021 relates primarily to the impact of interest rate movements on the following 

• the potential refinancing of our 208 billion in existing debt compared to 197 billion in the prior year 

• our 22 billion of floating rate debt representing approximately 10 of total debt compared to 9 in the prior year and 

• potential future borrowings of incremental debt including borrowings under our 2016 credit facility and issuances under the cp program 

potential refinancing of existing debt 

we have no significant contractual debt maturities or anticipated repayment dates on our tower revenue notes over the next 12 months other than commercial paper notes that may be outstanding from time to time and principal payments on certain outstanding debt see below for a tabular presentation of our scheduled contractual debt maturities as of december 31 2021 and a discussion of anticipated repayment dates 

floating rate debt 

we manage our exposure to market interest rates on our existing debt by controlling the mix of fixed and floating rate debt as of december 31 2021 we had 22 billion of floating rate debt none of which had libor floors as a result a hypothetical unfavorable fluctuation in market interest rates on our existing debt of 18 of a percent point over a 12month period would increase our interest expense by approximately 3 million as of december 31 2020 we had approximately 19 billion of floating rate debt none of which had libor floors see also item 1a risk factors for a discussion related to the anticipated discontinuation of libor 

potential future borrowings of incremental debt 

we typically do not hedge our exposure to interest rates on potential future borrowings of incremental debt for a substantial period prior to issuance see item 7 mda—liquidity and capital resources regarding our liquidity strategy

 item 1 business 

overview 

we own operate and lease shared communications infrastructure that is geographically dispersed throughout the us including approximately 1 40000 towers and other structures such as rooftops collectively towers and 2 80000 route miles of fiber primarily supporting small cell networks small cells and fiber solutions we refer to our towers fiber and small cells assets collectively as communications infrastructure and to our customers on our communications infrastructure as tenants our operating segments consist of 1 towers and 2 fiber which includes both small cells and fiber solutions our core business is providing access including space or capacity to our shared communications infrastructure via longterm contracts in various forms including lease license sublease and service agreements collectively tenant contracts we seek to increase our site rental revenues by adding more tenants on our shared communications infrastructure which we expect to result in significant incremental cash flows due to our low incremental operating costs we operate as a reit for us federal income tax purposes see item 1 business—reit status and notes 2 and 9 to our consolidated financial statements 

over the last two decades we have assembled a leading portfolio of towers predominately through acquisitions from large wireless carriers or their predecessors more recently both through acquisitions and new construction of small cells and fiber we have extended our communications infrastructure presence by investing significantly in our fiber segment through our product offerings of towers and small cells we seek to provide a comprehensive solution to enable our wireless tenants to expand coverage and capacity for wireless networks furthermore within our fiber segment we seek to generate cash flow growth and stockholder return by deploying our fiber for both small cells and fiber solutions tenants 

approximately 56 and 71 of our towers are located in the 50 and 100 largest us basic trading areas btas respectively our towers have a significant presence in each of the top 100 btas we derive approximately 40 of our towers site rental gross margin from towers located on land that we own including through fee interests and perpetual easements and we derive approximately 60 of our towers site rental gross margin from towers located on land that we lease sublease manage or license the contracts for the land under our towers have an average total remaining life of approximately 36 years including all renewal terms exercisable at our option weighted based on towers site rental gross margin the majority of our small cells and fiber are located in major metropolitan areas including a presence within every major us market the vast majority of our fiber assets are located on public rightsofway 

our largest tenants are tmobile which merged with sprint in april 2020 att and verizon wireless which collectively accounted for approximately 76 of our 2020 consolidated site rental revenues including revenues previously derived from sprint see note 14 to our consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our largest tenants site rental revenues represented 91 of our 2020 consolidated net revenues of which approximately 66 and 34 were from our towers segment and our fiber segment respectively within our fiber segment 70 and 30 of our 2020 fiber site rental revenues related to fiber solutions and small cells respectively the vast majority of our site rental revenues are of a recurring nature and are derived from longterm tenant contracts with our tenants 

our site rental revenues derived from wireless tenants typically result from longterm tenant contracts with 1 initial terms of five to 15 years 2 multiple renewal periods of five to 10 years each exercisable at the option of the tenant 3 limited termination rights for our tenants and 4 monthly rental payments with contractual escalations of the rental price and in some cases an additional upfront payment our site rental revenues derived from our fiber solutions tenants including from organizations with highbandwidth and multilocation demands typically result from tenant contracts with 1 initial terms that generally vary between three to 20 years and 2 a fixed monthly recurring fee and in some cases an additional upfront payment exclusive of renewals exercisable at the tenants option our tenant contracts have a weightedaverage remaining life of approximately five years and represent 27 billion of expected future cash inflows 

as part of our effort to provide comprehensive communications infrastructure solutions as an ancillary business we also offer certain services primarily relating to our towers segment predominately consisting of 1 site development services primarily relating to existing or new tenant equipment installations including site acquisition architectural and engineering or zoning and permitting collectively site development services and 2 tenant equipment installation or subsequent augmentations collectively installation services 

strategy 

as a leading provider of shared communications infrastructure in the us our strategy is to create longterm stockholder value via a combination of 1 growing cash flows generated from our existing portfolio of communications infrastructure 2 returning a meaningful portion of our cash generated by operating activities to our common stockholders in the form of dividends and 3 investing capital efficiently to grow cash flows and longterm dividends per share our strategy is based in part on our belief that the us is the most attractive market for shared communications infrastructure investment with the greatest longterm growth potential we measure our efforts to create longterm stockholder value by the combined payment of dividends to stockholders and growth in our pershare results the key elements of our strategy are to 

• grow cash flows from our existing communications infrastructure we are focused on maximizing the recurring site rental cash flows generated from providing our tenants with longterm access to our shared infrastructure assets which we believe is the core driver of value for our stockholders tenant additions or modifications of existing tenant equipment collectively tenant additions enable our tenants to expand coverage and capacity in order to meet increasing demand for data while generating high incremental returns for our business we believe our product offerings of towers and small cells provide a comprehensive solution to our wireless tenants growing network needs through our shared communications infrastructure model which is an efficient and costeffective way to serve our tenants additionally we believe our ability to share our fiber assets across multiple tenants to deploy both small cells and offer fiber solutions allows us to generate cash flows and increase stockholder return 

• return cash generated by operating activities to common stockholders in the form of dividends  we believe that distributing a meaningful portion of our cash generated by operating activities appropriately provides common stockholders with increased certainty for a portion of expected longterm stockholder value while still allowing us to retain sufficient flexibility to invest in our business and deliver growth we believe this decision reflects the translation of the highquality longterm contractual cash flows of our business into stable capital returns to common stockholders 

• invest capital efficiently to grow cash flows and longterm dividends per share in addition to adding tenants to existing communications infrastructure we seek to invest our available capital including the net cash generated by our operating activities and external financing sources in a manner that will increase longterm stockholder value on a riskadjusted basis these investments include constructing and acquiring new communications infrastructure that we expect will generate future cash flow growth and attractive longterm returns by adding tenants to those assets over time our historical investments have included the following in no particular order 

◦ construction of towers fiber and small cells 

◦ acquisitions of towers fiber and small cells 

◦ acquisitions of land interests which primarily relate to land assets under towers 

◦ improvements and structural enhancements to our existing communications infrastructure 

◦ purchases of shares of our common stock from time to time and 

◦ purchases repayments or redemptions of our debt 

our strategy to create longterm stockholder value is based on our belief that there will be considerable future demand for our communications infrastructure based on the location of our assets and the rapid growth in the demand for data we believe that such demand for our communications infrastructure will continue will result in growth of our cash flows due to tenant additions on our existing communications infrastructure and will create other growth opportunities for us such as demand for newly constructed or acquired communications infrastructure as described above further we seek to augment the longterm value creation associated with growing our recurring site rental cash flows by offering certain ancillary site development and installation services within our towers segment 

reit status 

we operate as a reit for us federal income tax purposes as a reit we are generally entitled to a deduction for dividends that we pay and therefore are not subject to us federal corporate income tax on our net taxable income that is currently distributed to our stockholders we may be subject to certain federal state local and foreign taxes on our income or assets including 1 taxes on any undistributed income 2 taxes related to our taxable reit subsidiaries trss 3 franchise taxes 4 property taxes and 5 transfer taxes in addition we could under certain circumstances be required to pay an excise or penalty tax which could be significant in amount in order to utilize one or more relief provisions under the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended code to maintain qualification for taxation as a reit 

the tax cuts and jobs act which was signed into law in 2017 tax reform act made substantial changes to the code among the many changes impacting corporations are a significant reduction in the corporate income tax rate the repeal 

of the corporate alternative minimum tax for years beginning in 2018 and limitations on the deductibility of interest expense in addition under the tax reform act qualified reit dividends within the meaning of section 199ae3 of the code constitute a part of a noncorporate taxpayers qualified business income amount and thus our noncorporate us stockholders may be eligible to take a qualified business income deduction in an amount equal to 20 of such dividends received from us without further legislative action the 20 deduction applicable to qualified reit dividends will expire on january 1 2026 the tax reform act has not had a material impact on us 

the vast majority of our assets and revenues are in the reit see notes 2 and 9 to our consolidated financial statements additionally we have included in trss certain other assets and operations those trs assets and operations will continue to be subject as applicable to federal and state corporate income taxes or to foreign taxes in the jurisdictions in which such assets and operations are located 

our foreign assets and operations including our tower operations in puerto rico most likely will be subject to foreign income taxes in the jurisdictions in which such assets and operations are located regardless of whether they are included in a trs 

to remain qualified and be taxed as a reit we will generally be required to annually distribute to our stockholders at least 90 of our reit taxable income after the utilization of our nols determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding net capital gain see notes 2 and 9 to our consolidated financial statements our quarterly common stock dividend will delay the utilization of our nols and may cause certain of the nols to expire without utilization see item 1a risk factors for risks associated with our reit status 

industry overview 

consumer demand for data continues to grow due to increases in data consumption and increased penetration of bandwidthintensive devices this increase in data consumption is driven by factors such as growth in 1 mobile entertainment such as mobile video mobile applications and social networking 2 mobile internet usage supporting web browsing and trends in telehealth remote working and other remote communications 3 machinetomachine applications or the internet of things such as connected cars and smart city technologies and 4 the adoption of other bandwidthintensive applications such as cloud services and video communications as a result consumer wireless devices are trending toward bandwidthintensive devices including smartphones laptops tablets wearables and other emerging and embedded devices and us wireless carriers are among the first carriers in the world to begin offering commercial 5th generation 5g mobile cellular communications services to further support such growth 

we expect the following anticipated factors to contribute to potential demand for our communications infrastructure 

• consumers growing wireless data consumption likely resulting in major wireless carriers continuing to upgrade and enhance their networks through the efficient use of both towers and small cells including in connection with 5g deployments in an effort to improve network quality and capacity and customer retention or satisfaction 

• prior and future potential spectrum auctioned licensed or made available by the federal communications commission fcc enabling additional wireless carrier network development 

• nextgeneration technologies and new uses for wireless communications may potentially result in new entrants or increased demand in the wireless industry which may include companies involved in the continued evolution and deployment of the internet of things 

• the continued adoption of bandwidthintensive applications could result in demand for highcapacity multilocation fiberbased network solutions and 

• increased government initiatives to expand broadband infrastructure to support connectivity throughout the us 

the company 

virtually all of our operations in both our towers and fiber operating segments are located in the us for more information about our operating segments see item 7 mda—general overview and note 14 to our consolidated financial statements our core business is providing access including space or capacity to our shared communications infrastructure via longterm tenant contracts in the us we believe our communications infrastructure is integral to our tenants networks and organizations see item 1 business—strategy 

towers segment we believe towers are the most efficient and costeffective solution for providing coverage and capacity for wireless carrier network deployments we acquired ownership interests or exclusive rights to the majority of our towers directly or indirectly from the largest us wireless carriers or their predecessors through transactions consummated since 1999 including transactions with 1 att in 2013 att acquisition 2 tmobile in 2012 tmobile acquisition 3 global signal inc in 2007 global signal acquisition which had originally acquired the majority of its towers from sprint prior to sprints merger with tmobile which was completed in 2020 4 companies now part of verizon wireless in 1999 and 2000 and 5 companies now part of att in 1999 and 2000 

we generally receive monthly rental payments from our towers tenants pursuant to longterm tenant contracts typically we negotiate initial contract terms of five to 15 years with multiple renewal periods of five to 10 years each exercisable at the option of the tenant and our tenant contracts typically include fixed escalations which generally exceed expected nonrenewals as discussed below we strive to negotiate with our existing tenant base for longer contractual terms which often contain fixed escalation rates 

our towers tenant contracts while amended and renegotiated over time have historically led to a longterm relationship with tenants on our towers resulting in a retention rate generally between 97 and 99 each year in general each renewable tenant contract automatically renews at the end of its term unless 1 the tenant provides prior notice of its intent not to renew or 2 the contract is amended or renegotiated see note 3 to our consolidated financial statements for a tabular presentation of the minimum rental payments due to us by tenants pursuant to tenant contracts without consideration of tenant renewal options 

the average monthly rental payment from a new tenant added to towers can vary based on 1 aggregate tenant volume 2 the region in the us where the tower is located or 3 the amount of space granted to a tenant which can be influenced by the physical size weight and shape of the tenants antenna installation or related equipment when possible we seek to receive rental payment increases in connection with tenant contract amendments pursuant to which our tenants add antennas or other equipment to our towers on which they already have equipment pursuant to preexisting tenant contracts our towers tenant contracts and pricing are not influenced by whether or not we perform the respective site development or installation services see —services below for a further discussion of our tower installation services 

as of december 31 2020 the average number of tenants calculated as a unique license together with any related amendments thereto per tower is approximately 21 the following chart sets forth the number of existing tenants per tower as of december 31 2020 see item 7 mda—accounting and reporting matters—critical accounting policies and estimates for a discussion of our impairment evaluation and our towers with no tenants 

fiber segment our fiber segment includes both small cells and fiber solutions 

• our small cells offload data traffic from towers and bolster our tenants network capacity where data demand is the greatest and are typically attached to public rightofway infrastructure including utility poles and street lights 

• we offer certain fiber solutions to organizations with highbandwidth and multilocation demands our fiber solutions provide essential connectivity resources needed to create integrated networks and support organizations 

our fiber assets include those we acquired from 1 nextg networks inc in 2012  2 quanta fiber networks inc in 2015 3 fpl fibernet holdings llc and certain other subsidiaries of nextera energy inc in 2017 4 wilcon holdings llc in 2017 and 5 lts group holdings llc in 2017 

we generally receive monthly recurring payments from our fiber tenants and in some cases receive upfront payments pursuant to tenant contracts the average monthly rental payment from a new tenant can vary based on the amount or cost of 1 construction for initial and subsequent tenants 2 fiber strand requirements and supply 3 equipment at the site 4 the region in the us where the fiber is located and 5 any upfront payment received 

additional site rental information for both our towers and fiber segments we have existing master agreements with our largest tenants including tmobile att and verizon wireless such agreements provide certain terms including economic terms that govern underlying contracts entered into during the term of the master agreements regarding the right to use our communications infrastructure by such tenants 

approximately half of our site rental cost of operations consists of towers ground lease expenses and the remainder includes fiber access expenses primarily leases of fiber assets and other access agreements to facilitate our communications infrastructure property taxes repairs and maintenance employee compensation or related benefit costs and utilities assuming current leasing activity levels our cash operating expenses generally tend to escalate at approximately the rate of inflation we seek to add tenants to our existing communications infrastructure assets at a low incremental operating cost delivering high incremental returns to our business once constructed our communications infrastructure portfolio requires minimal sustaining capital expenditures including maintenance or other nondiscretionary capital expenditures which are typically approximately 2 of net revenues see note 13 to our consolidated financial statements for a tabular presentation of the rental payments we owe to landlords pursuant to our operating lease agreements 

services as part of our effort to provide comprehensive communications infrastructure solutions as an ancillary business we also offer certain services primarily relating to our towers segment predominately consisting of 1 site development services and 2 installation services for 2020 approximately 65 of our services and other revenues related to installation services and the remainder predominately related to site development services we seek to grow our service revenues by capitalizing on 1 increased leasing volumes that may result from carrier network upgrades 2 promoting site development services 3 expanding the scope of our services and 4 focusing on tenant service and deployment speed we have the capability and expertise to install with the assistance of our network of subcontractors equipment or antenna systems for our tenants we do not always provide the installation services or site development services for our tenants on our communications infrastructure as other service providers also provide these services see also —competition below these activities are typically nonrecurring and highly competitive with several competitors in most markets typically our installation services are billed on a costplus profit basis and site development services are billed on a fixed fee basis the terms and pricing of both site development services and installation services are negotiated separately from our tenant contracts 

customers our towers customers are primarily comprised of large wireless carriers that operate national networks 

our fiber customers generally consist of large wireless carriers and organizations with highbandwidth and multilocation demands such as enterprise government education healthcare wholesale financial legal media and entertainment content distribution and energy and utilities customers 

our three largest tenants are tmobile att and verizon wireless collectively these three tenants accounted for approximately 76 of our 2020 site rental revenues including revenues previously derived from sprint see item 1a risk factors for risks associated with our dependence on a small number of customers and note 14 to our consolidated financial statements for 2020 our site rental revenues by tenant were as follows 

a includes revenues previously derived from sprint on april 1 2020 tmobile and sprint announced the completion of their previously disclosed merger 

sales and marketing our sales organization markets our communications infrastructure with the objective of contracting access with tenants to existing communications infrastructure or to new communications infrastructure prior to construction we seek to become the critical partner and preferred independent communications infrastructure provider for our tenants and increase tenant satisfaction relative to our peers by leveraging our 1 existing unique communications infrastructure footprint 2 tenant relationships 3 processcentric approach 4 technological tools and 5 construction capabilities and expertise 

our sales team is organized based on a variety of factors including tenant type such as large wireless carriers vertical customers and organizations product offering and geography a team of national account directors maintains our relationships with our largest tenants these directors work to develop new business opportunities as well as to ensure that tenants communications infrastructure needs are efficiently translated into new contracts for our communications infrastructure sales personnel in our local offices develop and maintain relationships with our tenants that are expanding their networks entering new markets seeking new or additional communication infrastructure offerings bringing new technologies to market or requiring maintenance or addon business in addition to our fulltime sales or marketing staff a number of seniorlevel employees spend a significant portion of their time on sales and marketing activities and call on existing or prospective tenants 

competition we face competition for site rental tenants from various sources including 1 other independent communications infrastructure owners or operators including competitors that own operate or manage towers rooftops broadcast or transmission towers utility poles fiber including nontraditional competitors such as cable providers or small cells 2 tenants who elect to selfperform or 3 new alternative deployment methods for communications infrastructure 

some of our largest competitors in the towers segment are american tower corporation and sba communications corporation our fiber segment business competitors can vary significantly based on geography some of the larger competitors in the fiber segment include other owners of fiber as well as recent and potential entrants into small cells and the fiber solutions business we believe that location existing communications infrastructure footprint deployment speed quality of service expertise reputation capacity and price have been and will continue to be the most significant competitive factors affecting our businesses see item 1a risk factors for a discussion of competition in our industry 

competitors to our services offering can include site acquisition consultants zoning consultants real estate firms rightofway consulting firms construction companies tower owners or managers radio frequency engineering consultants our tenants internal staff or contractors or telecommunications equipment vendors who can provide turnkey site development services through multiple subcontractors we believe that our tenants base their decisions on the outsourcing of services on criteria such as a companys experience record of accomplishment reputation price and time for completion of a project 

human capital

regulatory and environmental matters 

we are required to comply with a variety of federal state and local regulations and laws in the us including fcc and federal aviation administration faa regulations and those discussed under —environmental below to date we have not incurred any material fines or penalties or experienced any material adverse effects to our business as a result of any domestic or international regulations including any environmental regulations the summary below is based on regulations currently in effect and such regulations are subject to review or modification by the applicable governmental authority from time to time if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations we may be fined or even lose our rights to conduct some of our business 

federal regulations both the fcc and the faa regulate towers used for wireless communications radio or television broadcasting such regulations control the siting construction modification lighting and marking of towers and may depending on the characteristics of particular towers require the registration of tower facilities with the fcc and the issuance of determinations confirming no hazard to air traffic wireless communications devices operating on towers are separately regulated and independently licensed based upon the particular frequency used in addition the fcc and the faa have developed standards to consider proposals for new or modified tower or antenna structures based upon the height or location including proximity to airports proposals to construct or to modify existing tower or antenna structures above certain heights are reviewed by the faa to ensure the structure will not present a hazard to aviation which determination may be conditioned upon compliance with lighting or marking requirements the fcc requires its licensees to operate communications devices only on towers that comply with faa rules and are registered with the fcc if required by its regulations where tower lighting is required by faa regulation tower owners bear the responsibility of notifying the faa of any tower lighting outage and ensuring the timely restoration of such outages 

state and local regulations the us telecommunications act of 1996 amended the communications act of 1934 to preserve state and local zoning authorities jurisdiction over the siting of communications towers and small cells the law however limits state and local zoning authority by prohibiting actions by such authorities that discriminate between different service providers of wireless communications or prohibit altogether actually or effectively the provision of wireless communications additionally the law prohibits state and local restrictions based on the environmental effects of radio frequency emissions to the extent the facilities comply with fcc regulations 

local regulations include city and other local ordinances including subdivision and zoning ordinances approvals for construction modification and removal of towers and small cells and restrictive covenants imposed by community developers these regulations vary greatly but typically require us to obtain prior approval from local officials local zoning authorities may render decisions that prevent the construction or modification of towers or small cells or place conditions on such 

construction or modifications that are responsive to community residents concerns regarding the height visibility or other characteristics of such infrastructure over the last several years the fcc has adopted regulations and 28 states have passed legislation intended to expedite and streamline the deployment of wireless networks including establishing presumptively reasonable timeframes for reviews by local and state governments notwithstanding such developments decisions of local regulatory authorities and utilities in certain jurisdictions may continue to adversely affect deployment timing and cost 

certain of our subsidiaries hold state authorizations including authorizations to act as competitive local exchange carriers clecs to provide intrastate telecommunication services in addition to fcc authorization to provide domestic interstate telecommunication services state authorizations may help promote access to public rightsofway which is beneficial to the timely deployment of fiber and small cells and often allow us to deploy such infrastructure in locations where zoning restrictions might otherwise delay restrict or prevent building or expanding traditional wireless tower and rooftop sites see item 1a risk factors for additional information regarding rights to our infrastructure 

environmental we are required to comply with a variety of federal state and local environmental laws and regulations protecting environmental quality including air and water quality and wildlife to date we have not incurred any material fines or penalties or experienced any material adverse effects to our business as a result of any domestic or international environmental regulations or matters see item 1a risk factors for additional information regarding compliance with laws and regulations 

the construction of new towers and small cells or in some cases their modification in the us may be subject to environmental review under the national environmental policy act of 1969 as amended nepa which requires federal agencies to evaluate the environmental impact of major federal actions nepa regulations require applicants to investigate the potential environmental impact of the proposed tower or small cells construction if the fcc determines that the proposed tower or small cells construction or modification presents a significant environmental impact the fcc is required to prepare an environmental impact statement which is subject to public comment such determination could significantly delay the fccs approval of the construction or modification 

our operations are also subject to federal state and local laws and regulations relating to the management use storage disposal emission or remediation of or exposure to hazardous or nonhazardous substances materials or wastes as an owner lessee or operator of real property we are subject to certain environmental laws that impose strict jointandseveral liability for the cleanup of onsite or offsite contamination relating to existing or historical operations or we could also be subject to personal injury or property damage claims relating to such contamination in general our tenant contracts prohibit our tenants from using or storing any hazardous substances on our communications infrastructure sites in violation of applicable environmental laws and require our tenants to provide notice of certain environmental conditions caused by them 

we are subject to occupational safety and health administration and similar guidelines regarding employee protection from radio frequency exposure in recent years the scientific community has extensively studied lowlevel radio frequency emissions to determine whether they have any connection to certain negative health effects such as cancer 

we have compliance programs and monitoring projects designed to promote compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations nevertheless there can be no assurance that the costs of compliance with existing or future environmental laws will not have a material adverse effect on us

our business depends on the demand for our communications infrastructure driven primarily by demand for data and we may be adversely affected by any slowdown in such demand additionally a reduction in the amount or change in the mix of network investment by our tenants may materially and adversely affect our business including reducing demand for our communications infrastructure or services 

tenant demand for our communications infrastructure depends on consumers and organizations demand for data additionally the willingness of our tenants to utilize our communications infrastructure or renew or extend existing tenant contracts on our communications infrastructure is affected by numerous factors including 

• availability or capacity of our communications infrastructure or associated land interests 

• location of our communications infrastructure 

• financial condition of our tenants including their profitability and availability or cost of capital 

• willingness of our tenants to maintain or increase their network investment or changes in their capital allocation strategy 

• need for integrated networks and organizations 

• availability and cost of spectrum for commercial use 

• increased use of network sharing roaming joint development or resale agreements by our tenants 

• mergers or consolidations by and among our tenants 

• changes in or success of our tenants business models 

• governmental regulations and initiatives including local or state restrictions on the proliferation of communications infrastructure 

• cost of constructing communications infrastructure 

• our market competition including tenants that may elect to selfperform 

• technological changes including those 1 affecting the number or type of communications infrastructure needed to provide data to a given geographic area or which may otherwise serve as a substitute or alternative to our communications infrastructure or 2 resulting in the obsolescence or decommissioning of certain existing wireless networks and 

• our ability to efficiently satisfy our tenants service requirements 

a slowdown in demand for data or our communications infrastructure may negatively impact our growth or otherwise have a material adverse effect on us if our tenants or potential tenants are unable to raise adequate capital to fund their business plans as a result of disruptions in the financial and credit markets or otherwise they may reduce their spending which could adversely affect our anticipated growth or the demand for our communications infrastructure or services 

the amount timing and mix of our tenants network investment is variable and can be significantly impacted by the various matters described in these risk factors changes in tenant network investment typically impact the demand for our communications infrastructure as a result changes in tenant plans such as delays in the implementation of new systems new and emerging technologies including small cells and fiber solutions or plans to expand coverage or capacity may reduce demand for our communications infrastructure furthermore the industries in which our tenants operate particularly those in the wireless industry could experience a slowdown or slowing growth rates as a result of numerous factors including a reduction in consumer demand for data or general economic conditions there can be no assurances that weakness or uncertainty in the economic environment will not adversely impact our tenants or their industries which may materially and adversely affect our business including by reducing demand for our communications infrastructure or services in addition a slowdown may increase competition for site rental tenants or services such an industry slowdown or a reduction in tenant network investment may materially and adversely affect our business 

a substantial portion of our revenues is derived from a small number of tenants and the loss consolidation or financial instability of any of such tenants may materially decrease revenues or reduce demand for our communications infrastructure and services 

our three largest tenants are tmobile which merged with sprint in april 2020 att and verizon wireless the loss of any one of our largest tenants as a result of consolidation merger bankruptcy insolvency network sharing roaming joint development resale agreements by our tenants or otherwise may result in 1 a material decrease in our revenues 2 uncollectible account receivables 3 an impairment of our deferred site rental receivables communications infrastructure assets or intangible assets or 4 other adverse effects to our business we cannot guarantee that tenant contracts with our largest tenants will not be terminated or that these tenants will renew their tenant contracts with us see item 7 mda—general overview—sprint cancellation for a discussion of the accelerated contractual rental payments received in the fourth quarter of 2020 resulting from tmobiles cancellation of small cells contracted with sprint prior to its merger with tmobile in addition to our three largest tenants we also derive a portion of our revenues and anticipated future growth from 1 fiber solutions tenants and 2 new entrants offering or contemplating offering wireless services such tenants including those dependent on government funding may be smaller or have less financial resources than our three largest tenants may have business models which may not be successful or may require additional capital 

consolidation among our tenants will likely result in duplicate or overlapping parts of networks for example where they are coresidents on a tower or small cell network which may result in the termination nonrenewal or renegotiation of tenant contracts and negatively impact revenues from our communications infrastructure due to the longterm nature of our tenant contracts we generally expect that the impact to our site rental revenues from any termination of our tenant contracts as a result of such potential consolidation would be spread over multiple years such consolidation or potential consolidation may result in a reduction or slowdown in such tenants network investment in the aggregate because their expansion plans may be similar tenant consolidation could decrease the demand for our communications infrastructure and services which in turn may result in a reduction in our revenues or cash flows and may trigger a review for impairment of certain longlived assets 

see item 1 business—the company and note 14 to our consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our largest tenants 

the expansion or development of our business including through acquisitions increased product offerings or other strategic growth opportunities may cause disruptions in our business which may have an adverse effect on our business operations or financial results 

we seek to expand and develop our business including through acquisitions increased product offerings such as small cells and fiber solutions or other strategic growth opportunities in the ordinary course of our business we review analyze and evaluate various potential transactions or other activities in which we may engage such transactions or activities could be a complex costly timeconsuming process or cause disruptions in increase risk or otherwise negatively impact our business among other things such transactions and activities may 

• disrupt our business relationships with our tenants depending on the nature of or counterparty to such transactions and activities 

• divert capital and the time or attention of management away from other business operations including as a result of posttransaction integration activities 

• fail to achieve revenue or margin targets operational synergies or other benefits contemplated 

• increase operational risk or volatility in our business 

• not result in the benefits management had expected to realize from such expansion and development activities or those benefits may take longer to realize than expected 

• impact our cost structure and result in the need to hire additional employees 

• increase demands on current employees or result in current or prospective employees experiencing uncertainty about their future roles with us which might adversely affect our ability to retain or attract key employees or 

• result in the need for additional trss or contributions of certain assets to trss which are subject to federal and state corporate income taxes 

our fiber segment has expanded rapidly and the fiber business model contains certain differences from our towers business model resulting in different operational risks if we do not successfully operate our fiber business model or identify or manage the related operational risks such operations may produce results that are lower than anticipated 

in recent years we have allocated a significant amount of capital to our fiber business which is a much less mature business for us than our towers business our fiber segment represented 34 and 33 of our site rental revenues for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively the business model for our fiber operations contains certain differences from our business model for our towers operations including certain differences relating to tenant base competition contract 

terms including requirements for service level agreements regarding network performance and maintenance upfront capital requirements landlord demographics deployment and ownership of certain network assets operational oversight requirements government regulations growth rates and applicable laws 

while our fiber operations have certain risks that are similar to our towers operations they also have certain operational risks including the scalability of processes that are different from our towers business including 

• the use of public rightsofway and franchise agreements 

• the use of poles and conduits owned solely by or jointly with third parties 

• risks relating to overbuilding 

• risks relating to the specific markets in which we choose or plan to operate in 

• risks relating to construction hazards including boring trenching utility and maintenance of traffic hazards 

• construction management and constructionrelated billings to tenants 

• risks relating to wireless carriers building their own small cell networks or tenants utilizing their own or alternative fiber assets 

• the risk of failing to optimize the use of our finite supply of fiber strands 

• damage to our assets and the need to maintain repair upgrade and periodically replace our assets 

• the risk of failing to properly maintain or operate highly specialized hardware and software 

• network data security risks 

• the risk of new technologies that could enable tenants to realize the same benefits with less utilization of our fiber 

• potential damage to our overall reputation as a communications infrastructure provider and 

• the use of clec status 

in addition the rate at which tenants adopt or prioritize small cells and fiber solutions may be lower or slower than we anticipate or may cease to exist altogether our fiber operations will also expose us to different safety or liability risks or hazards than our towers business as a result of numerous factors including those stemming from the deployment location or nature of the assets involved there may be risks and challenges associated with small cells and fiber solutions being comparatively new and emerging technologies that are continuing to evolve and there may be other risks related to small cells and fiber solutions of which we are not yet aware 

failure to timely efficiently and safely execute on our construction projects could adversely affect our business 

our construction projects and related contracts can be longterm complex in nature costly and challenging to execute the quality of our performance on such construction projects depends in large part upon our ability to manage 1 the associated tenant relationship and 2 the project itself by timely deploying and properly managing appropriate internal and external project resources in connection with our construction projects we generally bear the risk of cost overruns labor availability and productivity and contractor pricing and performance 

in addition the construction projects including modifications of existing infrastructure can pose certain safety risks including 

• risks resulting from elevated work including falling hazards 

• risks of thirdparty noncompliance with safety regulations industry best practices or other applicable standards 

• risks associated with utility hazards and 

• risk of potential wildfires including due to welding grinding cutting or other construction activity 

further investments in newly constructed communications infrastructure may result in lower initial returns compared to returns on our existing communications infrastructure or us not being able to realize future tenant additions at anticipated levels additionally contracts with our tenants for these projects typically specify delivery dates performance criteria and penalties for our failure to perform on occasion we experience unforeseen delays from municipalities and utility companies that result in longer construction timelines than expected which impact our ability to timely deliver on our projects our failure to manage such tenant relationships project resources and project milestones in a timely and efficient manner and appropriately manage safety risks could have a material adverse effect on our business 

new technologies may reduce demand for our communications infrastructure or negatively impact our revenues 

improvements in the efficiency architecture and design of communication networks may reduce the demand for our communications infrastructure for example new technologies that may promote network sharing joint development backhaul and fronthaul efficiency or resale agreements by our tenants such as signal combining technologies or network virtualization may reduce the need for our communications infrastructure in addition other technologies such as wifi distributed antenna systems das other small cells blimps satellite such as low earth orbiting and mesh transmission 

systems may in the future serve as substitutes for or alternatives to leasing on communications infrastructure that might otherwise be anticipated or expected had such technologies not existed in addition new technologies that enhance the range efficiency and capacity of communication equipment could reduce demand for our communications infrastructure any significant reduction in demand for our communications infrastructure resulting from the new technologies may negatively impact our revenues or otherwise have a material adverse effect on us 

if we fail to retain rights to our communications infrastructure including the rights to land under our towers and the rightofway and other agreements related to our small cells and fiber our business may be adversely affected 

the property interests and other rights to our communications infrastructure including the land under our towers are derived from leasehold and subleasehold interests fee interests easements licenses rightsofway and franchise and other agreements a loss of these interests and other rights may interfere with our ability to conduct our business or generate revenues for various reasons we may not always have the ability to access analyze or verify all information regarding titles or other issues prior to acquiring communications infrastructure further we may not be able to renew ground leases or other agreements on commercially viable terms 

our ability to retain rights to the land on which our towers are located depends on our ability to purchase such land by acquiring fee interests and perpetual easements or renegotiate or extend the terms of the agreements relating to such land approximately 10 of our towers site rental gross margin for the year ended december 31 2020 was derived from towers where the leases for the land under such towers had final expiration dates of less than 10 years if we are unable to retain rights to the property on which our communications infrastructure is located our business may be adversely affected 

as of december 31 2020 approximately 53 of our towers were leased or subleased or operated and managed under master leases subleases or other agreements with att and tmobile including agreements assumed by tmobile in connection with its merger with sprint we have the option to purchase these towers at the end of their respective lease terms we have no obligation to exercise such purchase options we may not have the required available capital to exercise our right to purchase some or all of these towers at the time these options are exercisable even if we do have available capital we may choose not to exercise our right to purchase these towers or some or all of the tmobile or att towers for business or other reasons in the event that we do not exercise these purchase rights or are otherwise unable to acquire an interest that would allow us to continue to operate these towers after the applicable period we will lose the cash flows derived from such towers which may have a material adverse effect on our business in the event that we decide to exercise these purchase rights the benefits of the acquisition of these towers may not exceed the costs which could adversely affect our business additional information concerning these towers and the applicable purchase options as of december 31 2020 is as follows 

• 22 of our towers are leased or subleased or operated and managed under a master prepaid lease or other related agreements with att for a weightedaverage initial term of approximately 28 years weighted on towers site rental gross margin we have the option to purchase the leased and subleased towers from att at the end of the respective lease or sublease terms for aggregate option payments of approximately 42 billion which payments if such option is exercised would be due between 2032 and 2048 

• 16 of our towers are leased or subleased or operated and managed for an initial period of 32 years through may 2037 under master leases subleases or other agreements with tmobile which tmobile assumed in connection with its merger with sprint we have the option to purchase in 2037 all but not less than all of the leased and subleased towers from tmobile for approximately 23 billion 

• 15 of our towers are leased or subleased or operated and managed under a master prepaid lease or other related agreements with tmobile for a weightedaverage initial term of approximately 28 years weighted on towers site rental gross margin we have the option to purchase the leased and subleased towers from tmobile at the end of the respective lease or sublease terms for aggregate option payments of approximately 20 billion which payments if such option is exercised would be due between 2035 and 2049 in addition through the tmobile acquisition another 1 of our towers are subject to a lease and sublease or other related arrangements with att we have the option to purchase these towers that we do not otherwise already own at the end of their respective lease terms for aggregate option payments of up to approximately 405 million which payments if such option is exercised would be due prior to 2032 less than 10 million would be due before 2025 

under master lease or master prepaid lease arrangements we have with att and tmobile including agreements assumed by tmobile in connection with its merger with sprint certain of our subsidiaries lease or sublease or are otherwise granted the right to manage and operate towers from bankruptcy remote subsidiaries of such carriers if one of these bankruptcy remote subsidiaries should become a debtor in a bankruptcy proceeding and is permitted to reject the underlying ground lease our subsidiaries could lose their interest in the applicable sites if our subsidiaries were to lose their interest in the applicable sites or if the applicable ground leases were to be terminated we would lose the cash flow derived from the towers 

on those sites which may have a material adverse effect on our business we have similar bankruptcy risks with respect to sites that we operate under management agreements 

for our small cells and fiber we must maintain rightsofway franchise pole attachment conduit use fiber use and other agreements to operate our assets for various reasons we may not always have the ability to maintain these agreements or obtain future agreements to construct maintain and operate our fiber assets access to rightsofway may depend on our clec status and we cannot be certain that jurisdictions will 1 recognize such clec status or 2 not change their laws concerning clec access to rightsofway if a material portion of these agreements are terminated or are not renewed we might be forced to abandon our assets which may adversely impact our business in order to operate our assets we must also maintain fiber agreements that we have with public and private entities there is no assurance that we will be able to renew these agreements on favorable terms or at all if we are unable to renew these agreements on favorable terms we may face increased costs or reduced revenues 

additionally in order to expand our communications infrastructure footprint to new locations we often need to obtain new or additional rightsofway and other agreements our failure to obtain these agreements in a prompt and costeffective manner may prevent us from expanding our footprint which may be necessary to meet our contractual obligations to our tenants and could adversely impact our business 

our services business has historically experienced significant volatility in demand which reduces the predictability of our results 

the operating results of our services business for any particular period may experience significant fluctuations given its nonrecurring nature and should not necessarily be considered indicative of longerterm results for this activity our services business is generally driven by demand for our communications infrastructure and may be adversely impacted by various factors including 

• competition 

• the timing mix and amount of tenant network investments 

• the rate and volume of tenant deployment plans 

• unforeseen delays or challenges relating to work performed 

• economic weakness or uncertainty 

• our market share or 

• changes in the size scope or volume of work performed 

if radio frequency emissions from wireless handsets or equipment on our communications infrastructure are demonstrated to cause negative health effects potential future claims could adversely affect our operations costs or revenues 

the potential connection between radio frequency emissions and certain negative health effects including some forms of cancer has been the subject of substantial study by the scientific community in recent years we cannot guarantee that claims relating to radio frequency emissions will not arise in the future or that the results of such studies will not be adverse to us 

public perception of possible health risks associated with cellular or other wireless connectivity services and wireless technologies such as 5g may slow or diminish the growth of wireless companies and deployment of new wireless technologies which may in turn slow or diminish our growth in particular negative public perception of and regulations regarding these perceived health risks may slow or diminish the market acceptance of wireless services and technologies if a connection between radio frequency emissions and possible negative health effects were established our operations costs or revenues may be materially and adversely affected we currently do not maintain any significant insurance with respect to these matters 

we may be vulnerable to security breaches or other unforeseen events that could adversely affect our operations business and reputation 

despite existing security measures certain of our communications infrastructure may be vulnerable to damage disruptions or shutdowns due to unauthorized access computer viruses cyberattacks and other security breaches an attack attempt or security breach such as a distributed denial of service attack could potentially result in 1 interruption or cessation of certain of our services to our tenants 2 our inability to meet expected levels of service to our tenants 3 data transmitted over our tenants networks being compromised or misappropriated or 4 business or other sensitive data being compromised or misappropriated we cannot guarantee that our security measures will not be circumvented resulting in tenant network failures or interruptions that could impact our tenants network availability and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or operational results additionally security incidents impacting our tenants vendors and business partners could result in a material adverse effect on our business we may be required to expend significant resources to protect against or 

recover from such threats if an actual or perceived breach of our security occurs the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed and we could lose tenants further the perpetrators of cyberattacks are not restricted to particular groups or persons these attacks may be committed by our employees or external actors operating in any geography in addition our acquisitions both past and future may alter our potential exposure to the risks described above 

additionally we could be negatively impacted by other unforeseen events such as extreme weather events or natural disasters including as a result of any potential effects of climate change or acts of vandalism there is increasing concern that global climate change is occurring and could result in increased frequency of certain types of natural disasters and extreme weather events we cannot predict with certainty the rate at which climate change is occurring or the potential direct or indirect impacts of climate change to our business any such unforeseen events could among other things damage or delay deployment of our communication infrastructure interrupt or delay service to our tenants or could result in legal claims or penalties disruption in operations damage to our reputation negative market perception or costly response measures which could adversely affect our business 

while we maintain insurance policies that include coverage in the event of security breaches and other unforeseen events there can be no assurances that such coverage will be adequate to cover exposure for such incidents 

the impact of coronavirus covid19 and related risks could materially affect our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

the global outbreak of the novel coronavirus covid19 was declared a pandemic by the world health organization and a national emergency by the us government in march 2020 and has adversely affected the us in response both the public and private sectors have introduced certain policies and initiatives in an effort to reduce the transmission of covid19 initiatives such as the imposition of travel restrictions mandates from federal state and local authorities to close nonessential businesses and avoid large gatherings of people quarantine or shelterinplace and the promotion of social distancing and the adoption of workfromhome and online learning by companies and institutions in addition the continued spread of covid19 and the resulting initiatives have led to a significant economic downturn global supply chain disruptions and volatility in the global capital markets 

we have modified and might further modify our business practices as a result of the covid19 pandemic the economic and social ramifications of the disease and the societal and governmental responses in the communities in which we operate we do not believe that covid19 had a material impact on our financial position results of operations and cash flows for the year ended december 31 2020 the extent to which the covid19 pandemic will affect our financial position results of operations and cash flows in the future is difficult to predict with certainty and depends on numerous evolving factors including the duration scope and severity of the pandemic the rollout of the covid19 vaccine and its effectiveness in curbing the spread of the virus government social business and other actions that have been and will be taken in response to the pandemic and the effect of the pandemic on short and longterm general economic conditions among other things covid19 and the initiatives could 1 adversely affect the ability of our suppliers and vendors to provide products and services to us 2 result in decreased demand for our communications infrastructure 3 make it more difficult for us to serve our tenants including as a result of delays or suspensions in the issuance of permits or other authorizations needed to conduct our business and 4 increase our cost of capital and adversely impact our access to capital due to factors beyond our knowledge or control including the duration and severity of covid19 as well as thirdparty actions taken to contain its spread and mitigate its public health effects at this time we cannot estimate or predict with certainty the impact of covid19 the initiatives or the measures we take in response thereto on our financial position results of operations and cash flows particularly over the near to mediumterm but the impact could be material see item 7 mda—general overview—coronavirus covid19 for further information 

as a result of competition in our industry we may find it more difficult to negotiate favorable rates on our new or renewing tenant contracts 

our growth is dependent on our entering into new tenant contracts including amendments to tenant contracts upon modification of an existing tower fiber or small cell installation as well as renewing or renegotiating tenant contracts when existing tenant contracts terminate competition in our industry may make it more difficult for us to attract new tenants maintain or increase our gross margins or maintain or increase our market share in addition competition primarily in our fiber solutions business may in certain circumstances cause us to renegotiate certain existing tenant contracts to avoid early contract terminations we face competition for site rental tenants and associated contractual rates from various sources including 1 other independent communications infrastructure owners or operators including those that own operate or manage towers rooftops broadcast or transmission towers utility poles fiber including nontraditional competitors such as cable providers or small cells or 2 new alternative deployment methods for communications infrastructure 

our fiber business generally has different competitors than those in our towers business including other owners of fiber as well as new entrants into small cells and fiber solutions some of which may have larger networks greater financial resources or more experience in managing such assets than we have 

new wireless technologies may not deploy or be adopted by tenants as rapidly or in the manner projected 

there can be no assurances that new wireless services or technologies which may drive demand for our communications infrastructure will be introduced or deployed as rapidly or in the manner projected by the wireless carriers in addition demand or tenant adoption rates for such new technologies may be lower or slower than anticipated for numerous reasons as a result growth opportunities or demand for our communications infrastructure arising from such technologies may not be realized at the times or to the extent anticipated 

risks related to our debt and equity 

our substantial level of indebtedness could adversely affect our ability to react to changes in our business and the terms of our debt instruments limit our ability to take a number of actions that our management might otherwise believe to be in our best interests in addition if we fail to comply with our covenants our debt could be accelerated 

we have a substantial amount of indebtedness approximately 212 billion as of february 17 2021 see item 7 mda—liquidity and capital resources for a tabular presentation of our contractual debt maturities as a result of our substantial indebtedness 

• we may be more vulnerable to general adverse economic or industry conditions 

• we may find it more difficult to obtain additional financing to fund discretionary investments or other general corporate requirements or to refinance our existing indebtedness 

• we are or will be required to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to the payment of principal or interest on our debt thereby reducing the available cash flows to fund other projects including the discretionary investments discussed in item 1 business and item 7 mda—liquidity and capital resources  

• we may have limited flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business or in the industry 

• we may have a competitive disadvantage relative to other companies in our industry with less debt 

• we may be adversely impacted by changes in interest rates 

• we may be adversely impacted by changes to credit ratings related to our debt instruments 

• we may be required to issue equity securities or securities convertible into equity or sell some of our assets possibly on unfavorable terms in order to meet payment obligations 

• we may be limited in our ability to take advantage of strategic business opportunities including communications infrastructure development or mergers and acquisitions and 

• we could fail to remain qualified for taxation as a reit due to limitations on our ability to declare and pay dividends to stockholders as a result of restrictive covenants in our debt instruments 

currently we have debt instruments in place that limit in certain circumstances our ability to incur additional indebtedness pay dividends create liens sell assets or engage in certain mergers and acquisitions among other things in addition the credit agreement credit agreement governing our senior unsecured credit facility which consists of our senior unsecured term loan a facility and senior unsecured revolving credit facility collectively 2016 credit facility contains financial maintenance covenants our ability to comply with these covenants or to satisfy our debt obligations will depend on our future operating performance if we violate the restrictions in our debt instruments or fail to comply with our financial maintenance covenants we will be in default under those instruments which in some cases would cause the maturity of a substantial portion of our longterm indebtedness to be accelerated furthermore if the limits on our ability to pay dividends prevent us from satisfying our reit distribution requirements we could fail to remain qualified for taxation as a reit if these limits do not jeopardize our qualification for taxation as a reit but nevertheless prevent us from distributing 100 of our reit taxable income we will be subject to federal and state corporate income taxes and potentially a nondeductible excise tax on our undistributed taxable income if our operating subsidiaries were to default on their debt the trustee could seek to foreclose the collateral securing such debt in which case we could lose the communications infrastructure and the associated revenues see item 7 mda—liquidity and capital resources—debt covenants for a further discussion of our debt covenants see also our risk factor below associated with our previously identified material weakness in internal controls over financial reporting which has been remediated for further discussion of risks that may impact our access to capital markets 

ccic is a holding company that conducts all of its operations through its subsidiaries accordingly ccics sources of cash to pay interest or principal on its outstanding indebtedness are distributions relating to its respective ownership interests in its subsidiaries from the net earnings and cash flows generated by such subsidiaries or from proceeds of debt or equity offerings earnings and cash flows generated by ccics subsidiaries are first applied by such subsidiaries to conduct their operations including servicing their respective debt obligations after which any excess cash flows generally may be paid to 

ccic in the absence of any special conditions such as a continuing event of default however ccics subsidiaries are legally distinct from the holding company and unless they guarantee such debt have no obligation to pay amounts due on their debt or to make funds available to us for such payment 

we have a substantial amount of indebtedness in the event we do not repay or refinance such indebtedness we could face substantial liquidity issues and might be required to issue equity securities or securities convertible into equity securities or sell some of our assets to meet our debt payment obligations 

we have a substantial amount of indebtedness which upon final maturity we will need to refinance or repay see item 7 mda—liquidity and capital resources for a tabular presentation of our contractual debt maturities there can be no assurances we will be able to refinance our indebtedness 1 on commercially reasonable terms 2 on terms including with respect to interest rates as favorable as our current debt or 3 at all 

economic conditions and the credit markets have historically experienced and may continue to experience periods of volatility uncertainty or weakness that could impact 1 the availability or cost of debt financing including any refinancing of the obligations described above 2 our ability to draw the full amount of our 50 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility under our 2016 credit facility 2016 revolver that as of february 17 2021 has 50 billion of undrawn availability or 3 our ability to issue the full amount of the 10 billion commercial paper notes commercial paper notes under our unsecured commercial paper program cp program that as of february 17 2021 had 150 million outstanding 

borrowings under our 2016 credit facility generally bear an interest rate based on the london interbank offered rate libor per annum plus a credit spread based on our senior unsecured credit rating in july 2017 the united kingdoms financial conduct authority which regulates libor announced that after 2021 it will stop compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of libor our credit agreement contemplates a mechanism for replacing libor with a new benchmark rate to be agreed upon by us and the administrative agent for loans made under the 2016 credit facility this mechanism is triggered in the event that libor is no longer published or otherwise available as a benchmark for establishing interest rates for loans since the conditions for the implementation of this mechanism have not yet been triggered we cannot determine with certainty what such replacement rate would be or reasonably predict the potential effect of these changes other reforms or the establishment of alternative reference rates on our business the discontinuation reform or replacement of libor could result in interest rate increases on our 2016 credit facility which could adversely affect our cash flows and operating results 

if we are unable to repay or refinance our debt we cannot guarantee that we will be able to generate enough cash flows from operations or that we will be able to obtain enough capital to service our debt fund our planned capital expenditures or pay future dividends in such an event we could face substantial liquidity issues and might be required to issue equity securities or securities convertible into equity securities or sell some of our assets to meet our debt payment obligations failure to repay or refinance indebtedness when required could result in a default under such indebtedness if we incur additional indebtedness any such indebtedness could exacerbate the risks described above 

sales or issuances of a substantial number of shares of our common stock or securities convertible into shares of our common stock may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

future sales or issuances of common stock or other equity related securities may adversely affect the market price of our common stock including any shares of our common stock issued to finance capital expenditures finance acquisitions or repay debt our business strategy contemplates access to external financing to fund certain discretionary investments which may include issuances of common stock or other equity related securities we maintain an atthemarket stock offering program 2018 atm program through which we may from time to time issue and sell shares of our common stock having an aggregate gross sales price of up to 750 million to or through sales agents as of february 17 2021 we had approximately 750 million of gross sales of common stock remaining under our 2018 atm program from time to time we may refresh or implement a new atthemarket stock offering program see note 10 to our consolidated financial statements as of february 17 2021 we had approximately 431 million shares of common stock outstanding 

we have reserved 8 million of common stock for issuance in connection with awards granted under our stock compensation plan 

further a small number of common stockholders own a significant percentage of our outstanding common stock if any one of these common stockholders or any group of our common stockholders sells a large quantity of shares of our common stock or the public market perceives that existing common stockholders might sell a large quantity of shares of our common stock the market price of our common stock may significantly decline 

certain provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation charter amended and restated bylaws bylaws and operative agreements and domestic and international competition laws may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us or for us to acquire control of a third party even if such a change in control would be beneficial to our stockholders 

we have a number of antitakeover devices in place that will hinder takeover attempts or may reduce the market value of our common stock our antitakeover provisions include 

• the authority of the board of directors to issue preferred stock without approval of the holders of our common stock 

• advance notice requirements for director nominations or actions to be taken at annual meetings and 

• a provision that the state courts or in certain circumstances the federal courts in delaware shall be the sole and exclusive forum for certain actions involving us our directors officers employees and stockholders 

our bylaws permit special meetings of the stockholders to be called only upon the request of our chief executive officer or a majority of the board of directors and deny stockholders the ability to call such meetings such provisions as well as the provisions of section 203 of the delaware general corporation law may impede a merger consolidation takeover or other business combination or discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us 

in addition domestic or international competition laws may prevent or discourage us from acquiring communications infrastructure in certain geographical areas or impede a merger consolidation takeover or other business combination or discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us 

risks relating to corporate compliance 

the restatement of our previously issued financial statements the errors that resulted in such restatement the material weakness that was previously identified in our internal control over financial reporting and the determination that our internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures were not effective could result in loss of investor confidence shareholder litigation or governmental proceedings or investigations any of which could cause the market value of our common stock or debt securities to decline or impact our ability to access the capital markets 

as discussed in the explanatory note and note 2 to our consolidated financial statements in our annual report on form 10k for the year ended december 31 2019 we identified and disclosed certain errors and determined that our previously issued consolidated financial statements for fiscal years ended december 31 2017 and 2018 and each of our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related disclosures for the quarterly and yeartodate periods during such years and for the first three quarters of fiscal year 2019 should be restated although the company has restated these financial statements and the previously identified material weakness in the companys internal control over financial reporting has been remediated as a result of these errors and restatement we were and continue to be subject to a number of additional risks and uncertainties including unanticipated legal fees litigation governmental proceedings or investigations other losses or damages and loss of investor confidence lawsuits naming the company and some of its officers and directors have been filed and additional lawsuits naming the company and its officers and directors may be filed in the future these lawsuits have resulted in and may result in further unanticipated legal costs regardless of the outcome of the litigation see note 12 to our consolidated financial statements for more information regarding the litigation we are currently unable to predict the outcome of any such litigation see item 9a controls and procedures for a discussion of the remediation of previously disclosed material weakness 

if we fail to comply with laws or regulations which regulate our business and which may change at any time we may be fined or even lose our right to conduct some of our business 

a variety of federal state local and foreign laws and regulations apply to our business including those discussed in item 1 business failure to comply with applicable requirements may lead to civil or criminal penalties require us to assume indemnification obligations or breach contractual provisions we cannot guarantee that existing or future laws or regulations including federal state local or foreign tax laws will not adversely affect our business including our reit status increase delays or result in additional costs we also may incur additional costs as a result of liabilities under applicable laws and regulations such as those governing environmental and safety matters these factors may have a material adverse effect on us 

risks relating to our reit status 

future dividend payments to our stockholders will reduce the availability of our cash on hand available to fund future discretionary investments and may result in a need to incur indebtedness or issue equity securities to fund growth 

opportunities in such event the then current economic credit market or equity market conditions will impact the availability or cost of such financing which may hinder our ability to grow our per share results of operations 

during each of the first three quarters of 2020 we paid a common stock dividend of 120 per share totaling approximately 15 billion in october 2020 our board of directors declared a quarterly common stock dividend of 133 per share which represents an increase of 11 from the quarterly common stock dividend declared during each of the first three quarters of 2020 we currently expect our common stock dividends over the next 12 months to be a cumulative amount of at least 532 per share or an aggregate amount of approximately 23 billion over time we expect to increase our dividend per share generally commensurate with our realized growth in cash flows any future dividends are subject to declaration by our board of directors see notes 10 and 17 to our consolidated financial statements 

we operate as a reit for us federal income tax purposes to remain qualified and be taxed as a reit we will generally be required to annually distribute at least 90 of our reit taxable income determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction excluding net capital gain and after the utilization of any available nols to our stockholders our quarterly cash common stock dividend will delay the utilization of our nols and may cause certain of the nols to expire without utilization see also item 1 business—reit status and item 7 mda—general overview—common stock dividend 

as discussed in item 1 mda—business—strategy we seek to invest our available capital including the net cash generated by our operating activities and external financing sources in a manner that we believe will increase longterm stockholder value on a riskadjusted basis our historical discretionary investments have included the following in no particular order construction of communications infrastructure acquisitions of communications infrastructure acquisitions of land interests which primarily relate to land assets under towers improvements and structural enhancements to our existing communications infrastructure purchases of shares of our common stock from time to time and purchases repayments or redemptions of our debt external financing including debt equity and equityrelated issuances to fund future discretionary investments either 1 may not be available to us or 2 may not be accessible by us at terms that would result in the investment of the net proceeds raised yielding incremental growth in our per share operating results as a result future dividend payments may hinder our ability to grow our per share results of operations or otherwise adversely affect our ability to execute our business plan 

remaining qualified to be taxed as a reit involves highly technical and complex provisions of the code failure to remain qualified as a reit would result in our inability to deduct dividends to stockholders when computing our taxable income which would reduce our available cash 

as a reit we are generally entitled to a deduction for dividends that we pay and therefore are not subject to us federal corporate income tax on our net taxable income that is currently distributed to our common stockholders 

while we intend to operate so that we remain qualified as a reit given the highly complex nature of the rules governing reits the importance of ongoing factual determinations the possibility of future changes in our circumstances and the potential impact of future changes to laws and regulations impacting reits no assurance can be given that we will qualify as a reit for any particular year 

in addition the present us federal tax treatment of reits is subject to change possibly with retroactive effect by legislative judicial or administrative action at any time and any such change might adversely affect our reit status or benefits we cannot predict the impact if any that such changes if enacted might have on our business however it is possible that such changes could adversely affect our business including our reit status 

if in any taxable year we fail to qualify for taxation as a reit and are not entitled to relief under certain provisions of the code then 

• we will not be allowed a deduction for dividends paid to stockholders in computing our taxable income 

• we will be subject to federal and state income tax including for applicable years beginning before january 1 2018 any applicable alternative minimum tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates and 

• we would be disqualified from reelecting reit status for the four taxable years following the year during which we were so disqualified 

although we may have federal nols available to reduce any taxable income to the extent our federal nols have been utilized or are otherwise unavailable any such corporate tax liability could be substantial would reduce the amount of cash available for other purposes and might necessitate the borrowing of additional funds or the liquidation of some investments to pay any additional tax liability accordingly funds available for investment would be reduced 

under the code for taxable years beginning in or after 2018 no more than 20 of the value of the assets of a reit may be represented by securities of one or more trss these limitations may affect our ability to make additional investments in nonreit qualifying operations or assets or in any operations held through trss the net income of our trss is not required to be distributed to us and income that is not distributed to us generally will not be subject to the reit income distribution requirement however there may be limitations on our ability to accumulate earnings in our trss and the accumulation or reinvestment of significant earnings in our trss could result in adverse tax treatment in particular if the accumulation of cash in our trss causes the fair market value of our securities in our trss to exceed current or future limitations of the fair market value of our assets at the end of any quarter then we may fail to remain qualified as a reit 

complying with reit requirements including the 90 distribution requirement may limit our flexibility or cause us to forgo otherwise attractive opportunities including certain discretionary investments and potential financing alternatives 

to remain qualified and be taxed as a reit we are required to satisfy the 90 distribution requirement as described above we commenced declaring regular quarterly dividends to our common stockholders beginning with the first quarter of 2014 see notes 10 and 17 to our consolidated financial statements any such dividends however are subject to the determination of and declaration by our board of directors based on thencurrent and anticipated future conditions including our earnings net cash generated by operating activities capital requirements financial condition our relative market capitalization our existing federal nols of approximately 15 billion or other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors 

to the extent that we satisfy the 90 distribution requirement but distribute less than 100 of our reit taxable income determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction excluding net capital gain and after the utilization of any available nols we will be subject to federal corporate income tax on our undistributed taxable income in addition we will be subject to a 4 nondeductible excise tax if the actual amount that we pay out to our stockholders for a calendar year is less than a minimum amount specified under the code 

from time to time we may generate reit taxable income greater than our cash flow as a result of differences in timing between the recognition of taxable income and the actual receipt of cash or the effect of nondeductible capital expenditures the creation of reserves or required debt or amortization payments if we do not have other funds available in these situations we could be required to borrow funds on unfavorable terms sell assets at disadvantageous prices or distribute amounts that would otherwise be invested in future acquisitions to make distributions sufficient to enable us to pay out enough of our taxable income to satisfy the reit dividend requirement and to avoid corporate income tax and the 4 excise tax in a particular year these alternatives could increase our costs or reduce our equity thus compliance with the reit requirements may hinder our ability to grow which could adversely affect the value of our common stock furthermore the reit dividend requirements may increase the financing we need to fund capital expenditures future growth or expansion initiatives which would increase our total leverage 

in addition to satisfying the 90 distribution requirement to remain qualified as a reit for tax purposes we are required to continually satisfy tests concerning among other things the sources of our income the nature and diversification of our assets and the ownership of our capital stock compliance with these tests will require us to refrain from certain activities and may hinder our ability to make certain attractive investments including the purchase of nonqualifying assets the expansion of nonreal estate activities or investments in the businesses to be conducted by our trss and to that extent limit our opportunities and our flexibility to change our business strategy furthermore acquisition opportunities in domestic or international markets may be adversely affected if we need or require the target company to comply with some reit requirements prior to completing any such acquisition in addition our status as a reit may result in investor pressures not to pursue growth opportunities that are not immediately accretive 

moreover if we fail to comply with certain asset ownership tests at the end of any calendar quarter we must correct the failure within 30 days after the end of the calendar quarter or qualify for certain statutory relief provisions to avoid losing our reit qualification as a result we may be required to liquidate assets in adverse market conditions or forgo otherwise attractive investments these actions may reduce our income and amounts available for distribution to our stockholders 

reit related ownership limitations and transfer restrictions may prevent or restrict certain transfers of our capital stock 

in order for us to continue to satisfy the requirements for reit qualification our capital stock must be beneficially owned by 100 or more persons during at least 335 days of a taxable year of 12 months or during a proportionate part of a shorter taxable year also not more than 50 of the value of the outstanding shares of our capital stock may be owned directly or indirectly by five or fewer individuals as defined in the code to include certain entities such as private foundations during the last half of a taxable year in order to facilitate compliance with the reit rules our charter includes provisions regarding reitrelated ownership limitations and transfer restrictions that generally prohibit any person as defined in our charter from beneficially or constructively owning or being deemed to beneficially or constructively own by virtue of the attribution 

provisions of the code more than 1 98 by value or number of shares whichever is more restrictive of the outstanding shares of our common stock or 2 98 in aggregate value of the outstanding shares of all classes and series of our capital stock in addition our charter provides for certain other ownership limitations and transfer restrictions under applicable constructive ownership rules any shares of capital stock owned by certain affiliated owners generally would be added together for purposes of the ownership limitations these ownership limitations and transfer restrictions could have the effect of delaying deferring or preventing a transaction or a change in control of our company that might involve a premium price for our capital stock or otherwise might be in the best interest of our stockholders

• we expect to continue to invest a significant amount of our available capital in the form of discretionary capital expenditures for 2021 based on the anticipated returns on such discretionary investments we expect that our discretionary capital expenditures in 2021 will decrease when compared to 2020 as a result of both 1 the completion of certain fiber expansion projects in 2020 and 2 an expected higher proportion of small cell capital expenditures associated with less capitalintensive tenant additions 

• we also expect sustaining capital expenditures of approximately 2 of net revenues for full year 2021 consistent with historical annual levels 

sprint cancellation 

during the fourth quarter of 2020 tmobile notified us that it was cancelling approximately 5700 small cell nodes initially contracted with sprint sprint cancellation prior to its merger with tmobile the majority of the cancelled small cells were not yet constructed and upon completion would have been located at the same locations as other tmobile small cells the sprint cancellation resulted in tmobile accelerating payment of all contractual rental obligations associated with the approximately 5700 small cells as well as the payment of capital costs incurred to date 

we received approximately 308 million from tmobile pursuant to the sprint cancellation during the fourth quarter of 2020 and recognized receipt of this payment as other operating income on our consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income loss for the year ended december 31 2020 

additionally we previously received upfront payments from sprint for certain small cells subject to the sprint cancellation which we previously recorded as deferred revenues and other longterm liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet as a result of the sprint cancellation we recognized the unamortized portion of such upfront payments or approximately 54 million as other operating income on our consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income loss for the year ended december 31 2020 

following the sprint cancellation the company separately evaluated property and equipment previously recorded related to the cancelled small cells the company wroteoff property and equipment deemed to have no alternative future use and as a result recognized approximately 63 million as asset writedown charges on the companys consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income loss for the year ended december 31 2020

coronavirus covid19 

in accordance with the us department of homeland security guidance issued in march 2020 designating telecommunications infrastructure and networks as critical infrastructure we have continued our operations to ensure viability of communications networks which are essential to public health and safety to date we have taken a variety of measures to ensure the availability of our critical infrastructure promote the health and safety of our employees and support the communities in which we operate these measures include requiring workfromhome arrangements for a large portion of our workforce imposing travel restrictions for our employees where practicable canceling physical participation in meetings events and conferences forming an internal committee to monitor and implement procedures for the return of our workforce to an office setting and other modifications to our business practices we will continue to actively monitor the situation and may take further actions as may be required by governmental authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees tenants business partners and stockholders 

we do not believe that covid19 had a material impact on our financial position results of operations and cash flows during the year ended december 31 2020 given our access to various sources of liquidity and no near term debt maturities other than commercial paper notes and principal payments on amortizing debt we currently anticipate that we will be able to maintain sufficient liquidity as we manage through the current environment see also item 1a risk factors and item 7 mda—liquidity and capital resources—liquidity position 

results of operations 

the following discussion of our results of operations for 2020 compared to 2019 should be read in conjunction with item 1 business item 7 mda—liquidity and capital resources and our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our results of operations and financial condition for 2019 compared to 2018 that is not included in this 2020 form 10k see part ii item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in our annual report on form 10k for the year ended december 31 2019 which was filed with the sec on march 10 2020 

the following discussion of our results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with gaap which require us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts see item 7 mda—accounting and reporting matters—critical accounting policies and estimates and note 2 to our consolidated financial statements see item 7 mda—accounting and reporting matters—nongaap and segment financial measures for a discussion of our use of 1 segment site rental gross margin 2 segment services and other gross margin 3 segment operating profit including their respective definitions and 4 adjusted ebitda including its definition and a reconciliation to net income

2020 and 2019 

total site rental revenues for 2020 grew by 227 million or 4 from 2019 this increase was predominately comprised of the factors depicted in the chart below 

in millions of dollars 

a includes amortization of upfront payments received from longterm tenants and other deferred credits commonly referred to as prepaid rent 

b represents the contribution from recent acquisitions until the oneyear anniversary of the acquisition 

towers site rental revenues for 2020 were 35 billion and increased by 108 million or 3 from approximately 34 billion during 2019 the increase in towers site rental revenues was impacted by the following items inclusive of straightline accounting tenant additions across our entire portfolio renewals or extensions of tenant contracts escalations and nonrenewals of tenants contracts tenant additions were influenced by our tenants ongoing efforts to improve network quality and capacity 

fiber site rental revenues for 2020 were 18 billion and increased by 119 million or 7 from 17 billion from 2019 the increase in fiber site rental revenues was predominately impacted by the increased demand for small cells and fiber solutions increased demand for small cells was driven by our tenants network strategy in an effort to provide capacity and relieve network congestion and increased demand for fiber solutions was driven by increasing demand for data 

the increase in towers site rental gross margin from 2019 to 2020 was related to the previouslymentioned 3 increase in towers site rental revenues and relatively fixed costs to operate our towers the increase in fiber site rental gross margins was predominately related to the previouslymentioned 7 increase in fiber site rental revenues 

towers services and other gross margin for 2020 was 71 million and decreased by 76 million or 52 from 147 million during 2019 which is a result of a slowdown of carrier activity and the volume and mix of services and other work revenues from our services and other offerings are of a variable nature as these revenues are not under longterm contracts 

selling general and administrative expenses for 2020 were 678 million and increased by 64 million or 10 from 614 million during 2019 the increase in selling general and administrative expenses was primarily related to the growth in our business 

towers operating profit for 2020 increased by 26 million or 1 from 2019 the increase in towers operating profit was primarily related to the growth in our towers site rental revenues and relatively fixed costs to operate our towers which was partially offset by the previouslymentioned decrease in towers services and other gross margin 

fiber operating profit for 2020 increased by 431 million or 45 from 2019 the increase in fiber operating profit was primarily related to 362 million of operating income recognized from the sprint cancellation and the previouslymentioned 

growth in our fiber site rental revenues partially offset by charges incurred related to a reduction in staffing during the fourth quarter of 2020 comprised of employee severance payments and termination benefits see item 7 mda—general overview—sprint cancellation and notes 2 and 15 to our consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the sprint cancellation see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the charges incurred related to the reduction in staffing 

depreciation amortization and accretion was approximately 16 billion for 2020 and increased by 36 million or 2 from 2019 this increase predominately resulted from a corresponding increase in our gross property and equipment due to capital expenditures 

asset writedown charges for 2020 increased by 55 million from 2019 primarily as a result of the writeoff of approximately 63 million in property and equipment which following the sprint cancellation we deemed to have no alternative future use see item 7 mda—general overview—sprint cancellation and notes 2 and 15 to our consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the sprint cancellation 

interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs were 689 million for 2020 and increased by 6 million or 1 from 683 million during 2019 the increase predominately resulted from a corresponding increase in our outstanding indebtedness due to the financing of our discretionary capital expenditures partially offset by reduction in the variable interest rate on our 2016 term loan a and 2016 revolver due to a lower libor see note 7 to our consolidated financial statements and item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for a further discussion of our debt 

as a result of repaying certain of our indebtedness in conjunction with our refinancing activities we incurred losses on retirement of longterm obligations of 95 million and 2 million for the years ended 2020 and 2019 respectively see note 7 to our consolidated financial statements 

the provisions for income taxes for 2020 and 2019 were 20 million and 21 million respectively for both 2020 and 2019 the effective tax rate differs from the federal statutory rate predominately due to our reit status including the dividends paid deduction see item 1 business—reit status item 7 mda—accounting and reporting matters—critical accounting policies and estimates and note 9 to our consolidated financial statements 

net income attributable to ccic stockholders was 11 billion during 2020 compared to 860 million during 2019 the increase was predominately related to the previouslymentioned operating income recognized as a result of the sprint cancellation and net growth in both our towers and fiber segments partially offset by 1 the previouslymentioned losses on retirement of longterm obligations 2 decrease in towers services activity and 3 increases in expenses including a asset writedown charges b selling general and administrative expenses and c depreciation amortization and accretion 

adjusted ebitda increased 407 million or 12 from 2019 to 2020 the increase was predominately related to the previouslymentioned operating income recognized as a result of the sprint cancellation and growth in our site rental activities in both towers and fiber segments partially offset by the previouslymentioned decrease in towers services activity 

liquidity and capital resources 

overview 

general our core business generates revenues under longterm tenant contracts see item 1 business—overview and item 7 mda—general overview—overview  from 1 the largest us wireless carriers and 2 fiber solutions tenants as a leading provider of shared communications infrastructure in the us our strategy is to create longterm stockholder value via a combination of 1 growing cash flows generated from our portfolio of communications infrastructure 2 returning a meaningful portion of our cash generated by operating activities to our stockholders in the form of dividends and 3 investing capital efficiently to grow cash flows and longterm dividends per share our strategy is based in part on our belief that the us is the most attractive market for shared communications infrastructure investment with the greatest longterm growth potential we measure our efforts to create longterm stockholder value by the combined payment of dividends to stockholders and growth in our per share results see item 1 business—strategy for a further discussion of our strategy 

we have engaged and expect to continue to engage in discretionary investments that we believe will maximize longterm stockholder value our historical discretionary investments include in no particular order constructing communications infrastructure acquiring communications infrastructure acquiring land interests which primarily relate to land assets under towers improving and structurally enhancing our existing communications infrastructure purchasing shares of our common stock and purchasing repaying or redeeming our debt we have recently spent and expect to continue to spend a significant percentage of our discretionary investments on the construction of small cells and fiber we seek to fund our discretionary investments with both net cash generated by operating activities and cash available from financing capacity such as the use of our undrawn availability from the 2016 revolver issuances under our cp program debt financings and issuances of equity or equityrelated securities including under our 2018 atm program 

we seek to maintain a capital structure that we believe drives longterm stockholder value and optimizes our weightedaverage cost of capital we target a leverage ratio of approximately five times adjusted ebitda and interest coverage of adjusted ebitda to interest expense of approximately three times subject to various factors such as the availability and cost of capital and the potential longterm return on our discretionary investments we may choose to increase or decrease our leverage or coverage from these targets for various periods of time we have no significant contractual debt maturities until 2023 other than commercial paper notes that may be outstanding from time to time and principal payments on certain outstanding debt

summary cash flows information   



operating activities the increase in net cash provided by operating activities of 357 million for 2020 from 2019 was due primarily to 1 payment received as a result of the sprint cancellation and 2 growth in our core business offset by a net decrease from changes in working capital changes in working capital contribute to variability in net cash provided by operating activities largely due to the timing of advanced payments by us and advanced receipts from tenants we expect to grow our net cash provided by operating activities in the future exclusive of changes in working capital if we realize expected growth in our core business 

investing activities net cash used for investing activities for 2020 decreased 340 million from 2019 primarily as a result of decreased discretionary capital expenditures in both our towers and fiber segment 

our capital expenditures are categorized as discretionary integration or sustaining as described below 

• discretionary capital expenditures are made with respect to activities which we believe exhibit sufficient potential to enhance longterm stockholder value they primarily consist of expansion or development of communications infrastructure including capital expenditures related to 1 enhancing communications infrastructure in order to add new tenants for the first time or support subsequent tenant equipment augmentations or 2 modifying the structure of a communications infrastructure asset to accommodate additional tenants and construction of new communications infrastructure discretionary capital expenditures also include purchases of land interests which primarily relates to land assets under towers as we seek to manage our interests in the land beneath our towers certain technologyrelated investments necessary to support and scale future customer demand for our communications infrastructure and other capital projects the expansion or development of existing communications infrastructure to accommodate new leasing typically varies based on among other factors 1 the type of communications infrastructure 2 the scope volume and mix of work performed on the communications infrastructure 3 existing capacity prior to installation or 4 changes in structural engineering regulations and standards currently construction of new communications infrastructure is predominately comprised of the construction of small cells and fiber including certain construction projects that may take 18 to 36 months to complete our decisions regarding discretionary capital expenditures are influenced by the availability and cost of capital and expected returns on alternative uses of cash such as payments of dividends and investments 

• integration capital expenditures consist of those capital expenditures made as a result of integrating acquired companies into our business 

• sustaining capital expenditures consist of those capital expenditures not otherwise categorized as discretionary or integration capital expenditures such as 1 maintenance capital expenditures on our communications infrastructure assets that enable our tenants ongoing quiet enjoyment of the communications infrastructure and 2 ordinary corporate capital expenditures 

a summary of our capital expenditures for the last three years is as follows 



a towers segment includes 113 million 208 million and 128 million of capital expenditures incurred during the twelve months ended december 31 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively in connection with tenant installations and upgrades on our towers 

capital expenditures decreased from 2019 to 2020 and were primarily impacted by a slowdown in tenant activity in 2020 compared to 2019 as well as the completion of certain large fiber expansion projects during 2020 our sustaining capital expenditures were approximately 2 of net revenues in 2020 consistent with historical annual levels see item 7 mda—general overview—outlook highlights for a discussion of our expectations surrounding 2021 capital expenditures 

financing activities we seek to allocate cash generated by our operations in a manner that will enhance longterm stockholder value which may include various financing activities such as in no particular order 1 paying dividends on our common stock currently expected to total at least 532 per share over the next 12 months or an aggregate amount of approximately 23 billion 2 purchasing our common stock or 3 purchasing repaying or redeeming our debt see item 7 mda—general overview—common stock dividend item 7 mda—liquidity and capital resources—overview and notes 7 10 and 17 to our consolidated financial statements 

in 2020 our financing activities predominately related to the following 

• paying an aggregate of 21 billion in dividends on our common stock 

• paying an aggregate of 85 million in dividends on our previously outstanding 6875 mandatory convertible preferred stock 

• issuing 125 billion aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes in april 2020 the net proceeds of which we used to repay outstanding indebtedness under the 2016 revolver and 

• issuing 25 billion aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes in june 2020 the proceeds of which together with available cash we used to redeem all of the previously outstanding 3400 senior notes 2250 senior notes and 4875 senior notes 

in 2019 our financing activities predominately related to the following 

• paying an aggregate of 19 billion in dividends on our common stock 

• paying an aggregate of 113 million in dividends on our previously outstanding 6875 mandatory convertible preferred stock 

• issuing 10 billion aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes in february 2019 the proceeds of which we used to repay a portion of the outstanding indebtedness under the 2016 revolver 

• establishing a cp program in april 2019 pursuant to which we may issue shortterm unsecured commercial paper notes notes under the cp program may be issued repaid and reissued from time to time with an aggregate principal amount of commercial paper notes outstanding under the cp program at any time not to exceed 10 billion the net proceeds of the commercial paper notes are expected to be used for general corporate purposes 

• entering into an amendment to the 2016 credit facility in june 2019 to 1 increase our commitments under the 2016 revolver by 750 million for total commitments of 50 billion and 2 extend the maturity of the 2016 credit facility from june 2023 to june 2024 and 

• issuing 900 million aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes in august 2019 the proceeds of which we used to repay outstanding indebtedness under the 2016 revolver and cp program

restricted cash  pursuant to the indentures governing certain of our operating companies debt securities all rental cash receipts of the issuers of these debt instruments and their subsidiaries are restricted and held by an indenture trustee the restricted cash in excess of required reserve balances is subsequently released to us in accordance with the terms of the indentures see also note 2 to our consolidated financial statements 

material cash requirements 

the following table summarizes our material cash requirements as of december 31 2020 after giving effect to our february 2021 senior notes offering and the use of the net proceeds therefrom these material cash requirements relate primarily to our outstanding borrowings or lease obligations for land interests under our towers the debt maturities reflect contractual maturity dates and do not consider the impact of the principal payments that will commence following the anticipated repayment dates of certain debt see footnote b   



a the impact of principal payments that will commence following the anticipated repayment dates of our tower revenue notes is not considered the tower revenue notes have principal amounts of 300 million 250 million 700 million and 750 million with anticipated repayment dates in 2022 2023 2025 and 2028 respectively see note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for our definition of and additional information regarding the tower revenue notes 

b if the tower revenue notes are not repaid in full by the applicable anticipated repayment dates the applicable interest rate increases by approximately 5 per annum and monthly principal payments commence using the excess cash flow as defined in the indenture governing the applicable tower revenue notes of the issuers of the tower revenue notes the tower revenue notes are presented based on their contractual maturity dates ranging from 2042 to 2048 and include the impact of an assumed 5 increase in interest rate that would occur following the anticipated repayment dates but exclude the impact of monthly principal payments that would commence using excess cash flow as defined in the indenture governing the applicable tower revenue notes of the issuers of the tower revenue notes the full year 2020 excess cash flow as defined in the indenture governing the applicable tower revenue notes of the issuers of the tower revenue notes was approximately 815 million we currently expect to refinance these notes on or prior to the respective anticipated repayment dates 

c interest payments on the variable rate debt are based on estimated rates currently in effect 

d amounts relate primarily to lease obligations for the land on which our towers are located and are based on the assumption that payments will be made for certain renewal periods exercisable at our option that are reasonably certain to be exercised and excludes our contingent payments for operating leases such as payments based on revenues derived from the communications infrastructure located on the leased asset as such arrangements are excluded from our operating lease liability see note 13 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our operating lease obligations see also the table below summarizing remaining terms to expiration 

the following chart summarizes our rights to the land interests under our towers including renewal terms exercisable at our option as of december 31 2020 as of december 31 2020 the leases for land interests under our towers had an average remaining life of approximately 36 years weighted based on towers site rental gross margin see item 1a risk factors   for a discussion of retaining land interests under our towers 

a inclusive of fee interests and perpetual easements 

b for the year ended december 31 2020 without consideration of the term of the tenant contract 

debt covenants 

our credit agreement contains financial maintenance covenants we are currently in compliance with these financial maintenance covenants and based upon our current expectations we believe we will continue to comply with our financial maintenance covenants in addition certain of our debt agreements contain restrictive covenants that place restrictions on us and may limit our ability to among other things incur additional debt and liens purchase our securities make capital expenditures dispose of assets undertake transactions with affiliates make other investments pay dividends or distribute excess cash flow see note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our debt covenants see also item 1a risk factors for a discussion of compliance with our debt covenants the following are ratios applicable to the financial maintenance covenants under the credit agreement as of december 31 2020 



  

a failure to comply with the financial maintenance covenants would absent a waiver result in an event of default under the credit agreement 

b as defined in the credit agreement 

c applicable solely to the extent that the senior unsecured debt rating by any two of sp moodys and fitch is lower than bbb baa3 or bbb respectively if applicable the consolidated interest coverage ratio must be greater than or equal to 250 

accounting and reporting matters 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our critical accounting policies and estimates are those that we believe 1 are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations or 2 require our most difficult subjective or complex judgments often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain in many cases the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically prescribed by gaap in other cases management is required to exercise judgment in the application of accounting principles with respect to particular transactions the critical accounting policies and estimates for 2020 are not intended to be a comprehensive list of our accounting policies and estimates see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for a summary of our significant accounting policies 

lease accounting — lessee for our towers segment our lessee arrangements primarily consist of ground leases for land under our towers ground leases for land are specific to each site and are generally for an initial term of five to 10 years and are renewable and cancelable after a notice period at our option we also enter into term easements and ground leases in which we prepay the entire term for our fiber segment our lessee arrangements primarily include leases of fiber assets to facilitate our small cells and fiber solutions the majority of our lease agreements have certain termination rights that provide for cancellation after a notice period and multiple renewal options exercisable at our option we include certain renewal option periods in the lease term when we determine that the options are reasonably certain to be exercised 

for both our towers and fiber segments operating lease expense is recognized on a ratable basis regardless of whether the payment terms require us to make payments annually quarterly monthly or for the entire term in advance certain of our ground lease and fiber lease agreements contain fixed escalation clauses such as fixed dollar or fixed percentage increases or inflationbased escalation clauses such as those tied to the change in consumer price index cpi if the payment terms include fixed escalator provisions the effect of such increases is recognized on a straightline basis we calculate the straightline expense over the contracts estimated lease term including any renewal option periods that we deem reasonably certain to be exercised 

we recognize a rightofuse rou asset and lease liability for each of our operating leases rou assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the estimated lease term and lease liabilities represent the present value of our future lease payments in assessing our leases and determining our lease liability at lease commencement or upon modification we are not able to readily determine the rate implicit for our lessee arrangements and thus use our incremental borrowing rate on a collateralized basis to determine the present value of our lease payments our rou assets are measured as the balance of the lease liability plus any prepaid or accrued lease payments and any unamortized initial direct costs 

we review the carrying value of our rou assets for impairment similar to our other longlived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable we could record impairments in the 

future if there are changes in 1 longterm market conditions 2 expected future operating results or 3 the utility of the assets that negatively impact the fair value of our rou assets 

revenue recognition 91 of our total revenue for 2020 consisted of site rental revenues which are recognized on a ratable basis over the fixed noncancelable term of the relevant tenant contract generally ranging from five to 15 years for site rental revenues derived from wireless tenants and three to 20 years for site rental revenues derived from fiber solutions tenants regardless of whether the payments from the tenant are received in equal monthly amounts during the life of a tenant contract certain of our tenant contracts contain 1 fixed escalation clauses such as fixeddollar or fixedpercentage increases or inflationbased escalation clauses such as those tied to the change in cpi 2 multiple renewal periods exercisable at the tenants option and 3 only limited termination rights at the applicable tenants option through the current term if the payment terms call for fixed escalations upfront payments or rentfree periods the revenue is recognized on a straightline basis over the fixed noncancelable term of the tenant contract when calculating our straightline rental revenues we consider all fixed elements of tenant contractual escalation provisions even if such escalation provisions contain a variable element such as an escalator tied to an inflationbased index in addition to a minimum to the extent we acquire belowmarket tenant leases for contractual interests with tenants on the acquired communications infrastructure for example with respect to small cells and fiber we record the fair value as deferred credits and amortize such deferred credits to site rental revenues over their estimated lease term since we recognize revenue on a straightline basis a portion of the site rental revenues in a given period represents cash collected or contractually collectible in other periods our assets related to straightline site rental revenues are included in other current assets and deferred site rental receivables amounts billed or received prior to being earned are deferred and reflected in deferred revenues and other longterm liabilities amounts to which we have an unconditional right to payment which are related to both satisfied or partially satisfied performance obligations are recorded within receivables net on the consolidated balance sheet 

as part of our effort to provide comprehensive communications infrastructure solutions as an ancillary business we also offer certain services primarily relating to our towers segment which represented 9 of our total revenues for 2020 services and other revenue consists predominately of 1 site development services primarily relating to existing or new tenant equipment installations including site acquisition architectural and engineering or zoning and permitting collectively site development services and 2 tenant equipment installation or subsequent augmentations collectively installation services upon contract commencement we assess our services to tenants and identify performance obligations for each promise to provide a distinct service 

we may have multiple performance obligations for site development services which primarily include structural analysis zoning permitting and construction drawings for each of the above performance obligations services revenues are recognized at completion of the applicable performance obligation which represents the point at which we believe we have transferred goods or services to the tenant the revenue recognized is based on an allocation of the transaction price among the performance obligations in a respective contract based on estimated standalone selling price 

the transaction price for tower installation services consists of amounts for 1 permanent improvements to our towers that represent a lease component and 2 the performance of the service amounts under our tower installation services agreements that represent a lease component are recognized as site rental revenues on a ratable basis over the length of the associated estimated lease term for the performance of the tower installation service we have one performance obligation which is satisfied at the time of the applicable installation or augmentation and recognized as services and other revenues 

since performance obligations are typically satisfied prior to receiving payment from tenants the unconditional right to payment is recorded within receivables net on our consolidated balance sheet 

the vast majority of our services revenues relates to our towers segment and generally have a duration of one year or less 

accounting for acquisitions — general as described in item 1 business the majority of our communications infrastructure has been acquired directly or indirectly from the three largest wireless carriers or their predecessors through transactions consummated since 1999 we evaluate each of our acquisitions to determine if it should be accounted for as a business combination or as an acquisition of assets for our business combinations we allocate the purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair value at the date of acquisition any purchase price in excess of the net fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is allocated to goodwill see item 7 mda—accounting and reporting matters—accounting for acquisitions—valuation below 

the determination of the final purchase price allocation could extend over several quarters resulting in the use of preliminary estimates that are subject to adjustment until finalized such changes could have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 

accounting for acquisitions — leases with respect to business combinations that include towers that we lease and operate such as the att and tmobile leased and subleased towers including towers owned by sprint prior to its merger with tmobile we evaluate such agreements to determine treatment as finance or operating leases the evaluation of such agreements for finance or operating lease treatment previously included consideration of each of the lease classification criteria under asc 8401025 namely 1 the transfer of ownership provisions 2 the existence of bargain purchase options 3 the length of the remaining lease term and 4 the present value of the minimum lease payments with respect to the att acquisition tmobile acquisition and the sprint towers acquired in the global signal acquisition we determined that the tower leases were finance leases and the underlying land leases were operating leases based upon the lease term criterion after considering the fragmentation criteria applicable under asc 8401025 to leases involving both land and buildings ie towers we determined that the fragmentation criteria was met and the tower leases could be accounted for as finance leases apart from the land leases which are accounted for as operating leases since 1 the fair value of the land in the aforementioned business combinations was greater than 25 of the total fair value of the leased property at inception and 2 the tower lease expirations occur beyond 75 of the estimated economic life of the tower assets 

accounting for acquisitions — valuation as of december 31 2020 our largest asset was property and equipment which primarily consists of communications infrastructure followed by goodwill operating lease rou assets and intangible assets our identifiable intangible assets predominately relate to the site rental contracts and tenant relationships intangible assets 

the fair value of the vast majority of our assets and liabilities is determined by using either 

1 discounted cash flow valuation methods for estimating identifiable intangibles such as site rental contracts and tenant relationships or operating lease rightofuse assets and lease liabilities acquired or 

2 estimates of replacement costs for tangible fixed assets such as communications infrastructure 

the purchase price allocation requires subjective estimates that if incorrectly estimated could be material to our consolidated financial statements including the amount of depreciation amortization and accretion expense the most important estimates for measurement of tangible fixed assets are 1 the cost to replace the asset with a new asset and 2 the economic useful life after giving effect to age quality and condition the most important estimates for measurement of intangible assets are 1 discount rates and 2 timing and amount of cash flows including estimates regarding tenant renewals and cancellations the most important estimates for measurement of operating lease rou assets and lease liabilities acquired are 1 present value of our future lease payments including whether renewals or extensions should be measured and 2 favorability or unfavorability to the current market terms with respect to business combinations that include towers that we lease and operate such as the att tmobile and sprint prior to sprints merger with tmobile completed on april 1 2020 leased and subleased towers we evaluate such agreements to determine treatment as finance or operating leases and identification of any bargain purchase options 

we record the fair value of obligations to perform certain asset retirement activities including requirements pursuant to our ground leases easements and leased facility agreements to remove communications infrastructure or remediate the space upon which certain of our communications infrastructure resides in determining the fair value of these asset retirement obligations we must make several subjective and highly judgmental estimates such as those related to 1 timing of cash flows 2 future costs 3 discount rates and 4 the probability of enforcement to remove the towers or small cells or remediate the land 

accounting for longlived assets — useful lives we are required to make subjective assessments as to the useful lives of our tangible and intangible assets for purposes of determining depreciation amortization and accretion expense that if incorrectly estimated could be material to our consolidated financial statements depreciation expense for our property and equipment is computed using the straightline method over the estimated useful lives of our various classes of tangible assets the substantial portion of our property and equipment represents the cost of our communications infrastructure which is generally depreciated with an estimated useful life equal to the shorter of 1 20 years or 2 the term of the lease including optional renewals for the land under our communications infrastructure 

the useful life of our intangible assets is estimated based on the period over which the intangible asset is expected to benefit us and gives consideration to the expected useful life of other assets to which the useful life may relate we review the expected useful lives of our intangible assets on an ongoing basis and adjust if necessary amortization expense for intangible assets is computed using the straightline method over the estimated useful life of each of the intangible assets the useful life of the site rental contracts and tenant relationships intangible assets is limited by the maximum depreciable life of the communications infrastructure 20 years as a result of the interdependency of the communications infrastructure and site rental contracts and tenant relationships in contrast the site rental contracts and tenant relationships are estimated to provide economic benefits for several decades because of the low rate of tenant cancellations and high rate of renewals experienced to date thus while site rental contracts and tenant relationships are valued based upon the fair value of the site rental contracts 

and tenant relationships which includes assumptions regarding both 1 tenants exercise of optional renewals contained in the acquired leases and 2 renewals of the acquired leases past the contractual term including exercisable options the site rental contracts are amortized over a period not to exceed 20 years as a result of the useful life being limited by the depreciable life of the communications infrastructure 

accounting for longlived assets — impairment evaluation we review the carrying values of property and equipment intangible assets or other longlived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable we utilize the following dual grouping policy for purposes of determining the unit of account for testing impairment of the site rental contracts and tenant relationships 

1 we pool site rental contracts and tenant relationships intangible assets and property and equipment into portfolio groups and 

2 we separately pool site rental contracts and tenant relationships by significant tenant or by tenant grouping for individually insignificant tenants as appropriate 

we first pool site rental contracts and tenant relationships intangible assets and property and equipment into portfolio groups for purposes of determining the unit of account for impairment testing because we view communications infrastructure as portfolios and communications infrastructure in a given portfolio and its related tenant contracts are not largely independent of the other communications infrastructure in the portfolio we reevaluate the appropriateness of the pooled groups at least annually this use of grouping is based in part on 1 our limitations regarding disposal of communications infrastructure 2 the interdependencies of communications infrastructure portfolios and 3 the manner in which communications infrastructure is traded in the marketplace the vast majority of our site rental contracts and tenant relationships intangible assets and property and equipment are pooled into the us owned communications infrastructure group secondly and separately we pool site rental contracts and tenant relationships by significant tenant or by tenant grouping for individually insignificant tenants as appropriate for purposes of determining the unit of account for impairment testing because we associate the value ascribed to site rental contracts and tenant relationships intangible assets to the underlying contracts and related tenant relationships acquired 

our determination that an adverse event or change in circumstance has occurred that indicates that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable will generally involve 1 a deterioration in an assets financial performance compared to historical results 2 a shortfall in an assets financial performance compared to forecasted results or 3 changes affecting the utility and estimated future demands for the asset when considering the utility of our assets we consider events that would meaningfully impact 1 our communications infrastructure or 2 our tenant relationships for example consideration would be given to events that impact 1 the structural integrity and longevity of our communications infrastructure or 2 our ability to derive benefit from our existing tenant relationships including events such as tenants bankruptcy or insolvency or loss of a significant tenant during 2020 there were no events or circumstances that caused us to review the carrying value of our intangible assets or property and equipment due in part to our assets performing consistently with or better than our expectations 

if the sum of the estimated future cash flows undiscounted from an asset or portfolio group significant tenant or tenant group for individually insignificant tenants as applicable is less than its carrying amount an impairment loss may be recognized if the carrying value were to exceed the undiscounted cash flows measurement of an impairment loss would be based on the fair value of the asset which is based on an estimate of discounted future cash flows the most important estimates for such calculations of undiscounted cash flows are 1 the expected additions of new tenants and equipment on our communications infrastructure and 2 estimates regarding tenant cancellations and renewals of tenant contracts we could record impairments in the future if changes in longterm market conditions expected future operating results or the utility of the assets results in changes for our impairment test calculations which negatively impact the fair value of our property and equipment and intangible assets or if we changed our unit of account in the future 

approximately 2 of our total towers currently have no tenants we continue to pay operating expenses on these towers in anticipation of obtaining tenants on these towers in the future primarily because of the demographics and continuing increase in demand for data in the areas around these individual towers we estimate based on current visibility potential tenants on a majority of these towers to the extent we do not believe there are longterm prospects of obtaining tenants on an individual asset and all other possible avenues for recovering the carrying value have been exhausted including sale of the asset we appropriately reduce the carrying value of such assets to fair value 

accounting for goodwill — impairment evaluation we test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis regardless of whether adverse events or changes in circumstances have occurred the annual test begins with goodwill and all intangible assets being allocated to applicable reporting units we then perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount if we conclude that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount we would be required to perform a quantitative 

goodwill impairment test if the carrying amount of a reporting unit is greater than its fair value an impairment loss shall be recognized in an amount equal to such excess limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit our reporting units are the same as our operating segments towers and fiber see note 14 to our consolidated financial statements we performed our most recent annual goodwill impairment test as of october 1 2020 which resulted in no impairments 

see also note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the recently adopted accounting pronouncement related to goodwill impairment evaluation 

deferred income taxes we operate as a reit for us federal income tax purposes our reit taxable income is generally not subject to federal and state income taxes as a result of the deduction for dividends paid and any usage of our remaining nols accordingly the only provision or benefit for federal income taxes for the year ended december 31 2020 relates to trss furthermore as a result of the deduction for dividends paid some or all of our nols related to our reit may expire without utilization see item 1 business—reit status for a discussion of the impact of our reit status 

our trss will continue to be subject as applicable to federal and state income taxes and foreign taxes in the jurisdictions in which such assets and operations are located our ability to utilize our nols is dependent in part upon us having sufficient future earnings to utilize our nols before they expire if market conditions change materially and we determine that we will be unable to generate sufficient taxable income in the future to utilize our nols we would be required to record an additional valuation allowance which would reduce our earnings such adjustments could cause a material effect on our results of operations for the period of the adjustment the change in our valuation allowance has no effect on our cash flows for a further discussion of our benefit provision for income taxes see item 7 mda—results of operations and note 9 to our consolidated financial statements

in addition to the nongaap financial measures used herein and as discussed in note 14 to our consolidated financial statements we also provide 1 segment site rental gross margin 2 segment services and other gross margin and 3 segment operating profit which are key measures used by management to evaluate the performance of our operating segments these segment measures are provided pursuant to gaap requirements related to segment reporting 

we define segment site rental gross margin as segment site rental revenues less segment site rental cost of operations which excludes stockbased compensation expense and prepaid lease purchase price adjustments recorded in consolidated site rental cost of operations we define segment services and other gross margin as segment services and other revenues less segment services and other cost of operations which excludes stockbased compensation expense recorded in consolidated services and other cost of operations we define segment operating profit as segment site rental gross margin plus segment services and other gross margin and segment other operating income expense less selling general and administrative expenses attributable to the respective segment all of these measurements of profit or loss are exclusive of depreciation amortization and accretion which are shown separately additionally certain costs are shared across segments and are reflected in our segment measures through allocations that management believes to be reasonable 

we use earnings before interest taxes depreciation amortization and accretion as adjusted adjusted ebitda which is a nongaap financial measure as an indicator of consolidated financial performance our measure of adjusted ebitda may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies including companies in the communications infrastructure sector or other reits and is not a measure of performance calculated in accordance with gaap adjusted ebitda should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for operating income loss net income loss net cash provided by used for operating investing and financing activities or other income statement or cash flow statement data prepared in accordance with gaap and should be considered only as a supplement to net income loss computed in accordance with gaap as a measure of our performance there are material limitations to using a measure such as adjusted ebitda including the difficulty associated with comparing results among more than one company including our competitors and the inability to analyze certain significant items including depreciation and interest expense that directly affect our net income or loss management compensates for these limitations by considering the economic effect of the excluded expense items independently as well as in connection with their analysis of net income loss 

we define adjusted ebitda as net income loss plus restructuring charges credits asset writedown charges acquisition and integration costs depreciation amortization and accretion amortization of prepaid lease purchase price adjustments interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs gains losses on retirement of longterm obligations net gain loss on interest rate swaps gains losses on foreign currency swaps impairment of availableforsale securities interest income other income expense benefit provision for income taxes cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle income loss from discontinued operations and stockbased compensation expense the reconciliation of adjusted ebitda to our net income loss is set forth below 



a the above reconciliation excludes the items included in our adjusted ebitda definition which are not applicable to the periods shown 

we believe adjusted ebitda is useful to investors or other interested parties in evaluating our financial performance because 

• it is the primary measure used by our management 1 to evaluate the economic productivity of our operations and 2 for purposes of making decisions about allocating resources to and assessing the performance of our operations 

• although specific definitions may vary it is widely used by investors or other interested parties in evaluation of the communications infrastructure sector and other reits to measure financial performance without regard to items such as depreciation amortization and accretion which can vary depending upon accounting methods and the book value of assets 

• we believe it helps investors and other interested parties meaningfully evaluate and compare the results of our operations 1 from period to period and 2 to our competitors by removing the impact of our capital structure primarily interest charges from our outstanding debt and asset base primarily depreciation amortization and accretion from our financial results and 

• it is similar to the measure of current financial performance generally used in our debt covenant calculations 

our management uses adjusted ebitda 

• as a performance goal in employee annual incentive compensation 

• as a measurement of financial performance because it assists us in comparing our financial performance on a consistent basis as it removes the impact of our capital structure primarily interest charges from our outstanding debt and asset base primarily depreciation amortization and accretion from our operating results 

• in presentations to our board of directors to enable it to have the same measurement of financial performance used by management 

• for planning purposes including preparation of our annual operating budget 

• as a valuation measure in strategic analyses in connection with the purchase and sale of assets 

• in determining selfimposed limits on our debt levels including the evaluation of our leverage ratio and interest coverage ratio and 

• with respect to compliance with our debt covenants which require us to maintain certain financial ratios that incorporate concepts such as or similar to adjusted ebitda 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

our primary exposures to market risks are related to changes in interest rates which may adversely affect our results of operations and financial position we seek to manage exposure to changes in interest rates where economically prudent to do so by utilizing fixed rate debt 

our interest rate risk as of december 31 2020 relates primarily to the impact of interest rate movements on the following after giving effect to our february 2021 senior notes offering and the use of the net proceeds therefrom 

• the potential refinancing of our 197 billion in existing debt compared to 182 billion in the prior year 

• our 15 billion of floating rate debt representing approximately 8 of total debt compared to 16 in the prior year and 

• potential future borrowings of incremental debt including borrowings under our 2016 credit facility and issuances under the cp program 

potential refinancing of existing debt 

we have no significant contractual debt maturities or anticipated repayment dates on our tower revenue notes over the next 12 months other than commercial paper notes and principal payments on certain outstanding debt as of december 31 2020 and december 31 2019 we had no interest rate swaps hedging any refinancings see below for a tabular presentation of our scheduled contractual debt maturities as of december 31 2020 and a discussion of anticipated repayment dates 

floating rate debt 

we manage our exposure to market interest rates on our existing debt by controlling the mix of fixed and floating rate debt as of december 31 2020 after giving effect to our february 2021 senior notes offering and the use of the net proceeds therefrom we had 15 billion of floating rate debt none of which had libor floors as a result a hypothetical unfavorable fluctuation in market interest rates on our existing debt of 18 of a percent point over a 12month period would increase our interest expense by approximately 2 million as of december 31 2019 we had approximately 30 billion of floating rate debt none of which had libor floors see also item 1a risk factors for a discussion of uncertainty related to the continued use of libor 

potential future borrowings of incremental debt 

we typically do not hedge our exposure to interest rates on potential future borrowings of incremental debt for a substantial period prior to issuance see item 7 mda—liquidity and capital resources regarding our liquidity strategy 

the following table provides information about our market risk related to changes in interest rates after giving effect to our february 2021 senior notes offering and the use of the net proceeds therefrom the future principal payments and weightedaverage interest rates are presented as of december 31 2020 these debt maturities reflect contractual maturity dates and do not consider the impact of the principal payments that will commence following the anticipated repayment dates of certain debt see footnotes b and d see note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our debt 



a the fair value of our debt is based on indicative quotes that is nonbinding quotes from brokers that require judgment to interpret market information including implied credit spreads for similar borrowings on recent trades or bidask offers these fair values are not necessarily indicative of the amount which could be realized in a current market exchange 

b the impact of principal payments that will commence following the anticipated repayment dates is not considered the tower revenue notes have principal amounts of 300 million 250 million 700 million and 750 million with anticipated repayment dates in 2022 2023 2025 and 2028 respectively 

c the average interest rate represents the weightedaverage stated coupon rate see also footnote d 

d if the tower revenue notes are not repaid in full by the applicable anticipated repayment dates the applicable interest rate increases by approximately 5 per annum and monthly principal payments commence using the excess cash flow as defined in the indenture governing the applicable tower revenue notes of the issuers of the tower revenue notes the tower revenue notes are presented based on their contractual maturity dates ranging from 2042 to 2048 and include the impact of an assumed 5 increase in interest rate that would occur following the anticipated repayment dates but exclude the impact of monthly principal payments that would commence using excess cash flow of the issuers of the tower revenue notes the full year 2020 excess cash flow of the issuers of the tower revenue notes was approximately 815 million we currently expect to refinance these notes on or prior to the respective anticipated repayment dates 

e consists of our senior unsecured term loan a facility 2016 term loan a and our 2016 revolver borrowings each of which matures in 2024

 item 1 business 

overview 

we own operate and lease shared communications infrastructure that is geographically dispersed throughout the us including 1 approximately 40000  towers and other structures such as rooftops collectively towers and 2 approximately 65000 route miles of fiber primarily supporting small cell networks small cells and fiber solutions our towers fiber and small cells assets are collectively referred to herein as communications infrastructure and our customers on our communications infrastructure are referred to herein as tenants our core business is providing access including space or capacity to our shared communications infrastructure via longterm contracts in various forms including lease license sublease and service agreements collectively contracts we seek to increase our site rental revenues by adding more tenants on our shared communications infrastructure which we expect to result in significant incremental cash flows due to our low incremental operating costs 

below is certain information concerning our business 

 certain information concerning our tenant and site rental contracts is as follows 

 as part of our effort to provide comprehensive communications infrastructure solutions we also offer certain services primarily relating to our towers and small cells predominately consisting of 1 site development services relating to existing or new tenant equipment installations including site acquisition architectural and engineering or zoning and permitting collectively 

 1 

site development services and 2 tenant equipment installation or subsequent augmentations collectively installation services the large majority of our services revenues relate to our towers segment 

strategy 

as a leading provider of shared communications infrastructure in the us our strategy is to create longterm stockholder value via a combination of 1 growing cash flows generated from our existing portfolio of communications infrastructure 2 returning a meaningful portion of our cash provided by operating activities to our common stockholders in the form of dividends and 3 investing capital efficiently to grow cash flows and longterm dividends per share our us focused strategy is based in part on our belief that the us is the most attractive market for shared communications infrastructure investment with the greatest longterm growth potential we measure our efforts to create longterm stockholder value by the combined payment of dividends to stockholders and growth in our per share results the key elements of our strategy are to 

 our strategy to create longterm stockholder value is based on our belief that additional demand for our communications infrastructure will be created by the expected continued growth in the demand for data we believe that such demand for our communications infrastructure will continue will result in growth of our cash flows due to tenant additions on our existing communications infrastructure and will create other growth opportunities for us such as demand for newlyconstructed or acquired communications infrastructure as described above 

company developments reit status and industry updates 

company developments  see item 1 business—overview item 1 business—the company item 7 mda  and our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of certain recent developments activities and results including the increase in our quarterly common stock dividend and our recent debt and equity financing activities 

reit status  we commenced operating as a reit for us federal income tax purposes effective january 1 2014 as a reit we are generally entitled to a deduction for dividends that we pay and therefore are not subject to us federal corporate income tax on our net taxable income that is currently distributed to our stockholders we may also be subject to certain federal state local and foreign taxes on our income or assets including 1 taxes on any undistributed income 2 taxes related to our taxable reit subsidiaries trss 3 franchise taxes 4 property taxes and 5 transfer taxes in addition we could in certain 

 2 

circumstances be required to pay an excise or penalty tax which could be significant in amount in order to utilize one or more relief provisions under the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended code to maintain qualification for taxation as a reit 

the tax cuts and jobs act enacted in 2018 tax reform act made substantial changes to the code among the many changes impacting corporations are a significant reduction in the corporate income tax rate the repeal of the corporate alternative minimum tax for years beginning in 2018 and limitations on the deductibility of interest expense in addition under the tax reform act qualified reit dividends within the meaning of section 199ae3 of the code constitute a part of a noncorporate taxpayers qualified business income amount and thus our noncorporate us stockholders may be eligible to take a qualified business income deduction in an amount equal to 20 of such dividends received from us without further legislative action the 20 deduction applicable to qualified reit dividends will expire on january 1 2026 the tax reform act has not had a material impact on the company 

the vast majority of our assets and revenues are in the reit see note 10  to our consolidated financial statements additionally we have included in trss certain other assets and operations those trs assets and operations will continue to be subject as applicable to federal and state corporate income taxes or to foreign taxes in the jurisdictions in which such assets and operations are located 

our foreign assets and operations including our tower operations in puerto rico most likely will be subject to foreign income taxes in the jurisdictions in which such assets and operations are located regardless of whether they are included in a trs 

to remain qualified and be taxed as a reit we will generally be required to annually distribute to our stockholders at least 90 of our reit taxable income after the utilization of our nols determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding net capital gain see notes 2  and 10  to our consolidated financial statements our quarterly common stock dividend will delay the utilization of our nols and may cause certain of the nols to expire without utilization 

industry update consumer demand for data continues to grow due to increases in data consumption and increased penetration of bandwidthintensive devices this increase in data consumption is driven by growth in factors such as 1 mobile entertainment such as mobile video mobile applications and social networking 2 mobile internet usage such as email and web browsing 3 machinetomachine applications or the internet of things such as smart city technologies and 4 the adoption of other bandwidthintensive applications such as cloud services and video communications as a result consumer wireless devices are trending toward bandwidthintensive devices including smartphones laptops tablets and other emerging devices and during the next several years us wireless carriers are expected to be among the first carriers in the world to offer commercial 5th generation 5g mobile cellular communications services to further support such growth 

we expect the following anticipated factors to contribute to potential demand for our communications infrastructure 

 the company 

virtually all of our operations are located in the us our operating segments consists of towers and fiber for more information about our operating segments see item 7 mda—general overview and note 15  to our consolidated financial statements our core business is providing access including space or capacity to our shared communications infrastructure in the us we believe our communications infrastructure is integral to our tenants networks and organizations see item 1 business—strategy 

 3 

towers segment   we believe towers are the most efficient and costeffective solution for providing coverage and capacity for wireless carrier network deployments we acquired ownership interests or exclusive rights to the majority of our towers directly or indirectly from the four largest wireless carriers or their predecessors through transactions consummated since 1999 including transactions with 1 att in 2013 att acquisition 2 tmobile in 2012 tmobile acquisition 3 global signal inc in 2007 global signal acquisition which had originally acquired the majority of its towers from sprint 4 companies now part of verizon wireless during 1999 and 2000 and 5 companies now part of att during 1999 and 2000 

we generally receive monthly rental payments from our towers tenants payable under longterm contracts we generally negotiate initial contract terms of five to 15 years with multiple renewal periods of five to 10 years each at the option of the tenant and our contracts typically include fixed escalations which generally exceed expected nonrenewals as discussed below and in some cases an additional upfront payment we continue to endeavor to negotiate with our existing tenant base for longer contractual terms which often contain fixed escalation rates 

our towers tenant contracts have historically had a high renewal rate with limited exceptions our towers tenant contracts may not be terminated prior to the end of their current term and nonrenewals have averaged approximately 25 of site rental revenues over the last five years inclusive of nonrenewals as a result of the decommissioning of the former leap wireless metropcs and clearwire networks acquired networks in general each tenant contract which is renewable will automatically renew at the end of its term unless the tenant provides prior notice of its intent not to renew see note 4  to our consolidated financial statements for a tabular presentation of the minimum rental cash payments due to us by tenants pursuant to lease agreements without consideration of tenant renewal options 

the average monthly rental payment from a new tenant added to towers can vary based on 1 aggregate tenant volume 2 the different regions in the us or 3 the physical size weight and shape of the antenna installation or related equipment when possible we seek to receive rental payment increases in connection with contract amendments pursuant to which our tenants add additional antennas or other equipment to our towers on which they already have equipment pursuant to preexisting contracts 

as of december 31 2018  the average number of tenants calculated as a unique license together with any related amendments thereto per tower is approximately 22 the following chart sets forth the number of existing tenants per tower as of december 31 2018  see item 7 mda—accounting and reporting matters—critical accounting policies and estimates  for a discussion of our impairment evaluation and our towers with no tenants 

fiber segment our fiber segment includes both small cells and fiber solutions 



 4 

 our fiber assets include those acquired from 1 nextg networks inc in 2012 nextg acquisition 2 quanta fiber networks inc in 2015 sunesys acquisition 3 fpl fibernet holdings llc and certain other subsidiaries of nextera energy inc in 2017 fibernet acquisition 4 wilcon holdings llc in 2017 wilcon acquisition and 5 lts group holdings llc in 2017 lightower acquisition the fibernet acquisition wilcon acquisition and lightower acquisition are collectively referred to herein as the 2017 acquisitions 

we generally receive monthly recurring payments from our fiber tenants and in some cases receive upfront payments payable pursuant to contracts the amount of the monthly payments can also be influenced by the amount or cost of 1 construction for initial and subsequent tenants 2 fiber strand requirements and supply 3 equipment at the site and 4 any upfront payment received 

additional site rental information for both of our towers and fiber segments we have existing master agreements with our largest tenants including att tmobile verizon wireless and sprint such agreements provide certain terms including economic terms that govern our tenants right to utilize our communications infrastructure entered into by such carriers during the term of their master agreements 

approximately half  of our site rental cost of operations consists of towers ground lease expenses and the remainder includes fiber access expenses primarily leases of fiber assets and other access agreements to facilitate our communications infrastructure property taxes repairs and maintenance employee compensation or related benefit costs and utilities assuming current leasing activity levels our cash operating expenses generally tend to escalate at approximately the rate of inflation the addition of new tenants to existing communications infrastructure assets is achieved at a low incremental operating cost delivering high incremental returns to our business once constructed our communications infrastructure portfolio requires minimal sustaining capital expenditures including maintenance or other nondiscretionary capital expenditures which are typically approximately 2  of net revenues see note 14  to our consolidated financial statements for a tabular presentation of the rental cash payments owed by us to landlords pursuant to our contractual agreements 

services   as part of our effort to provide comprehensive communications infrastructure solutions we also offer certain services primarily relating to our towers and small cells predominately consisting of 1 site development services and 2 installation services the large majority of our service revenues relate to our towers segment for 2018  approximately 60  of our services and other revenues related to installation services and the remainder predominately related to site development services we seek to grow our service revenues by capitalizing on increased volumes that may result from carrier network upgrades promoting site development services expanding the scope of our services and focusing on tenant service and deployment speed we have the capability and expertise to install with the assistance of our network of subcontractors equipment or antenna systems for our tenants we do not always provide the installation services or site development services for our tenants on our communications infrastructure as third parties also provide these services see also —competition below these activities are typically nonrecurring and highly competitive with a number of local competitors in most markets typically our installation services are billed on a costplus profit basis and site development services are billed on a fixed fee basis 

customers  our towers customers are primarily comprised of large wireless carriers that operate national networks 

our fiber customers are generally large wireless carriers and organizations with highbandwidth and multilocation demands such as enterprise government education healthcare wholesale financial legal media and entertainment content distribution and energy and utilities customers 

 5 

our four largest tenants are att tmobile verizon wireless and sprint collectively these four tenants accounted for 73  of our 2018  site rental revenues also see item 1a risk factors  and note 15  to our consolidated financial statements for 2018  our site rental revenues by tenant were as follows 

sales and marketing  our sales organization markets our communications infrastructure with the objective of contracting access with tenants to existing communications infrastructure or to new communications infrastructure prior to construction we seek to become the critical partner and preferred independent communications infrastructure provider for our tenants and increase tenant satisfaction relative to our peers by leveraging our 1 existing unique communications infrastructure footprint 2 tenant relationships 3 processcentric approach 4 technological tools and 5 construction capabilities and expertise 

our sales team is organized based on a variety of factors including tenant type such as wireless carriers and organizations and geography a team of national account directors maintains our relationships with our largest tenants these directors work to develop communications infrastructure contracts as well as to ensure that tenants communications infrastructure needs are efficiently translated into new contracts on our communications infrastructure sales personnel in our local offices develop and maintain relationships with our tenants that are expanding their networks entering new markets seeking new or additional communication infrastructure offerings bringing new technologies to market or requiring maintenance or addon business in addition to our fulltime sales or marketing staff a number of seniorlevel employees spend a significant portion of their time on sales and marketing activities and call on existing or prospective tenants 

competition  we face competition for site rental tenants from various sources including 1 other independent communications infrastructure owners or operators including competitors that own operate or manage towers rooftops broadcast towers utility poles fiber including nontraditional competitors such as cable providers or small cells 2 tenants who elect to selfperform or 3 new alternative deployment methods for communications infrastructure 

some of the larger companies with which we compete for towers segment business opportunities include american tower corporation and sba communications corporation our fiber segment business competitors can vary significantly based on geography some of the larger companies with which we compete for fiber segment business opportunities include other owners of fiber as well as recent and potential entrants into small cells and fiber solutions we believe that location existing communications infrastructure footprint deployment speed quality of service expertise reputation capacity and price have been and will continue to be the most significant competitive factors affecting our businesses see item 1a risk factors 

competitors to our services offering include site acquisition consultants zoning consultants real estate firms rightofway consulting firms construction companies tower owners or managers radio frequency engineering consultants telecommunications equipment vendors who can provide turnkey site development services through multiple subcontractors or our tenants internal staff we believe that our tenants base their decisions on the outsourcing of services on criteria such as a companys experience record of accomplishment reputation price and time for completion of a project 

employees 

at january 31 2019  we employed approximately 5000 people we are not a party to any collective bargaining agreements we have not experienced any strikes or work stoppages and management believes that our employee relations are satisfactory

regulatory and environmental matters 

we are required to comply with a variety of federal state and local regulations and laws in the us including fcc and federal aviation administration faa regulations and those discussed under —environmental  below to date we have not incurred any material fines or penalties or experienced any material adverse effects to our business as a result of any domestic or international regulations the summary below is based on regulations currently in effect and such regulations are subject to review or modification by the applicable governmental authority from time to time if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations we may be fined or even lose our rights to conduct some of our business 

federal regulations  both the fcc and the faa regulate towers used for wireless communications radio or television broadcasting such regulations control the siting lighting or marking of towers and may depending on the characteristics of particular towers require the registration of tower facilities with the fcc and the issuance of determinations confirming no hazard to air traffic wireless communications devices operating on towers are separately regulated and independently licensed based upon the particular frequency used in addition the fcc and the faa have developed standards to consider proposals for new or modified tower or antenna structures based upon the height or location including proximity to airports proposals to construct or to modify existing tower or antenna structures above certain heights are reviewed by the faa to ensure the structure will not present a hazard to aviation which determination may be conditioned upon compliance with lighting or marking requirements the fcc requires its licensees to operate communications devices only on towers that comply with faa rules and are registered with the fcc if required by its regulations where tower lighting is required by faa regulation tower owners bear the responsibility of notifying the faa of any tower lighting outage and ensuring the timely restoration of such outages failure to comply with the applicable requirements may lead to civil penalties 

local regulations  the us telecommunications act of 1996 amended the communications act of 1934 to preserve state and local zoning authorities jurisdiction over the siting of communications towers and small cells the law however limits local zoning authority by prohibiting actions by local authorities that discriminate between different service providers of wireless communications or ban altogether the provision of wireless communications additionally the law prohibits state and local restrictions based on the environmental effects of radio frequency emissions to the extent the facilities comply with fcc regulations 

local regulations include city and other local ordinances including subdivision and zoning ordinances approvals for construction modification and removal of towers and small cells and restrictive covenants imposed by community developers these regulations vary greatly but typically require us to obtain approval from local officials prior to tower construction local zoning authorities may render decisions that prevent the construction or modification of towers or place conditions on such construction or modifications that are responsive to community residents concerns regarding the height visibility or other characteristics of the towers over the last several years there have been several developments related to fcc regulations and legislation that assist in expediting and streamlining the deployment of wireless networks including establishing timeframes for reviews by local and state governments notwithstanding such legislative and fcc actions decisions of local zoning authorities may also adversely affect the timing or cost of communications infrastructure construction or modification 

certain of our fiber related subsidiaries hold authorizations to provide intrastate telecommunication services as competitive local exchange carriers clec in numerous states and to provide domestic interstate telecommunication services as authorized by the fcc these fiber subsidiaries are primarily regulated by state public service commissions clec status in certain cases helps promote access to public rightsofway which is beneficial to the deployment of our small cells on a timely basis status as a clec often allows us to deploy our small cells in locations where zoning restrictions might otherwise delay restrict or prevent building or expanding traditional wireless tower sites or traditional wireless rooftop sites see item 1a risk factors 

environmental we are required to comply with a variety of federal state and local environmental laws and regulations protecting environmental quality including air and water quality and wildlife protection to date we have not incurred any material fines or penalties or experienced any material adverse effects to our business as a result of any domestic or international environmental regulations or matters see item 1a risk factors 

the construction of new towers and small cells or in some cases the modification of existing towers in the us may be subject to environmental review under the national environmental policy act of 1969 as amended nepa which requires federal agencies to evaluate the environmental impact of major federal actions the fcc has promulgated regulations implementing nepa which require applicants to investigate the potential environmental impact of the proposed tower or small cells construction should the proposed tower or small cells construction present a significant environmental impact the fcc must prepare an environmental impact statement subject to public comment if the proposed construction or modification of a tower poses a significant impact on the environment the fccs approval of the construction or modification could be significantly delayed 

our operations are subject to federal state and local laws and regulations relating to the management use storage disposal emission or remediation of or exposure to hazardous or nonhazardous substances materials or wastes as an owner lessee or operator of real property we are subject to certain environmental laws that impose strict jointandseveral liability for the 

 7 

cleanup of onsite or offsite contamination relating to existing or historical operations or we could also be subject to personal injury or property damage claims relating to such contamination in general our tenant contracts prohibit our tenants from using or storing any hazardous substances on our communications infrastructure sites in violation of applicable environmental laws and require our tenants to provide notice of certain environmental conditions caused by them 

as licensees and communications infrastructure owners we are also subject to regulations and guidelines that impose a variety of operational requirements relating to radio frequency emissions as employers we are subject to occupational safety and health administration and similar guidelines regarding employee protection from radio frequency exposure the potential connection between radio frequency emissions and certain negative health effects including some forms of cancer has been the subject of substantial study by the scientific community in recent years 

we have compliance programs and monitoring projects to help assure that we are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations nevertheless there can be no assurance that the costs of compliance with existing or future environmental laws will not have a material adverse effect on us

 item 1a risk factors 

you should carefully consider all of the risks described below as well as the other information contained in this document when evaluating your investment in our securities 

risks relating to our business 

our business depends on the demand for our communications infrastructure driven primarily by demand for data and we may be adversely affected by any slowdown in such demand additionally a reduction in the amount or change in the mix of network investment by our tenants may materially and adversely affect our business including reducing demand for our communications infrastructure or services 

tenant demand for our communications infrastructure depends on the demand for data the willingness of our tenants to utilize our communications infrastructure or renew or extend existing contracts on our communications infrastructure is affected by numerous factors including 

 a slowdown in demand for data or our communications infrastructure may negatively impact our growth or otherwise have a material adverse effect on us if our tenants or potential tenants are unable to raise adequate capital to fund their business plans as a result of disruptions in the financial and credit markets or otherwise they may reduce their spending which could adversely affect our anticipated growth or the demand for our communications infrastructure or services 

the amount timing and mix of our tenants network investment is variable and can be significantly impacted by the various matters described in these risk factors changes in tenant network investment typically impact the demand for our communications infrastructure as a result changes in tenant plans such as delays in the implementation of new systems new and emerging technologies including small cells and fiber solutions or plans to expand coverage or capacity may reduce demand for our communications infrastructure furthermore the industries in which our tenants operate particularly those in the wireless industry could experience a slowdown or slowing growth rates as a result of numerous factors including a reduction in consumer demand including demand for wireless connectivity or general economic conditions there can be no assurances that weakness or uncertainty in the economic environment will not adversely impact our tenants or their industries which may materially and adversely affect our business including by reducing demand for our communications infrastructure or services in addition a slowdown may increase competition for site rental tenants or services such an industry slowdown or a reduction in tenant network investment may materially and adversely affect our business 

 9 

a substantial portion of our revenues is derived from a small number of tenants and the loss consolidation or financial instability of any of such tenants may materially decrease revenues or reduce demand for our communications infrastructure and services 

our four largest tenants are att tmobile verizon wireless and sprint collectively these four tenants accounted for 73  of our 2018  site rental revenues the loss of any one of our large tenants as a result of consolidation merger bankruptcy insolvency network sharing roaming joint development resale agreements by our tenants or otherwise may result in 1 a material decrease in our revenues 2 uncollectible account receivables 3 an impairment of our deferred site rental receivables communications infrastructure assets intangible assets or 4 other adverse effects to our business we cannot guarantee that contracts with our major tenants will not be terminated or that these tenants will renew their contracts with us in addition to our four largest tenants we also derive a portion of our revenues and anticipated future growth from 1 fiber solutions tenants and 2 new entrants offering or contemplating offering wireless services such tenants including those dependent on government funding may be smaller or have less financial resources than our four largest tenants may have business models which may not be successful or may require additional capital 

consolidation among our tenants will likely result in duplicate or overlapping parts of networks for example where they are coresidents on a tower which may result in the termination nonrenewal or renegotiation of tenant contracts and negatively impact revenues from our communications infrastructure due to the longterm nature of tenant contracts we expect that any termination of tenant contracts as a result of this potential consolidation would be spread over multiple years such consolidation may result in a reduction in such tenants future network investment in the aggregate because their expansion plans may be similar tenant consolidation could decrease the demand for our communications infrastructure which in turn may result in a reduction in our revenues or cash flows 

in april 2018 tmobile and sprint entered into a definitive agreement to merge subject to regulatory approval and other closing conditions this potential transaction may result in a decrease or delay in demand for our communications infrastructure and services as a result of the anticipated integration of the tmobile and sprint networks and related duplicate or overlapping parts of their networks which may lead to a reduction in our revenues or cash flows and may trigger a review for impairment of certain longlived assets for the year ended december 31 2018 tmobile and sprint represented approximately 19  and 14  respectively of the companys consolidated site rental revenues further the company derived approximately 6 of its consolidated site rental revenues from each of tmobile and sprint on communications infrastructure where both carriers currently reside inclusive of approximately 1 impact from previously disclosed expected nonrenewals from the anticipated decommissioning of portions of tmobiles metropcs and sprints clearwire networks in addition there is an average of approximately five years and six years of current term remaining on all lease agreements with tmobile and sprint respectively see also item 1 business—the company  and note 15  to our consolidated financial statements 

the expansion or development of our business including through acquisitions increased product offerings or other strategic growth opportunities may cause disruptions in our business which may have an adverse effect on our business operations or financial results 

we seek to expand and develop our business including through acquisitions increased product offerings such as small cells and fiber solutions or other strategic growth opportunities in the ordinary course of our business we review analyze and evaluate various potential transactions or other activities in which we may engage such transactions or activities could be a complex costly timeconsuming process or cause disruptions in increase risk or otherwise negatively impact our business among other things such transactions and activities may 

 

 10 

our fiber segment has expanded rapidly and the fiber business model contains certain differences from our towers business model resulting in different operational risks if we do not successfully operate our fiber business model or identify or manage the related operational risks such operations may produce results that are less than anticipated 

in recent years we have allocated a significant amount of capital to our fiber business which is a much less mature business for us than our towers business which we have operated since 1994 our fiber segment represented 34  and 21 of our site rental revenues for the years ended december 31 2018 and 2017 respectively the business model for our fiber operations contains certain differences from our business model for our towers operations including certain differences relating to tenant base competition contract terms including requirements for service level agreements regarding network performance and maintenance upfront capital requirements landlord demographics ownership of certain network assets operational oversight requirements government regulations growth rates and applicable laws 

while our fiber operations have certain risks that are similar to our towers operations they also have certain operational risks including the scalability of processes that are different from our towers business including 

 in addition the rate at which tenants adopt or prioritize small cells and fiber solutions may be lower or slower than we anticipate or may cease to exist altogether our fiber operations will also expose us to different safety or liability risks or hazards than our towers business as a result of numerous factors including the location or nature of the assets involved there may be risks and challenges associated with small cells and fiber solutions being comparatively new and emerging technologies that are continuing to evolve and there may be other risks related to small cells and fiber solutions of which we are not yet aware 

failure to timely and efficiently execute on our construction projects could adversely affect our business 

our construction projects and related contracts particularly in our fiber business can be longterm complex in nature and challenging to execute the quality of our performance on such construction projects depends in large part upon our ability to manage 1 the associated tenant relationship and 2 the project itself by timely deploying and properly managing appropriate internal and external project resources in connection with our construction projects we generally bear the risk of cost overruns labor availability and productivity and contractor pricing and performance additionally contracts with our tenants for these projects typically specify delivery dates performance criteria and penalties for our failure to perform further investments in newlyconstructed communications infrastructure may result in lower initial returns compared to returns on our existing communications infrastructure or us not being able to to realize future tenant additions at anticipated levels our failure to manage such tenant relationships project resources and project milestones in a timely and efficient manner could have a material adverse effect on our business 

our substantial level of indebtedness could adversely affect our ability to react to changes in our business and the terms of our debt instruments and our 6875 convertible preferred stock limit our ability to take a number of actions that our management might otherwise believe to be in our best interests in addition if we fail to comply with our covenants our debt could be accelerated 

we have a substantial amount of indebtedness approximately 167 billion as of february 22 2019  see item 7 mda—liquidity and capital resources  for a tabular presentation of our contractual debt maturities as a result of our substantial indebtedness 



 11 

 currently we have debt instruments in place that limit in certain circumstances our ability to incur additional indebtedness pay dividends create liens sell assets or engage in certain mergers and acquisitions among other things in addition the credit agreement governing our senior unsecured credit facility 2016 credit facility contains financial maintenance covenants our ability to comply with these covenants or to satisfy our debt obligations will depend on our future operating performance if we violate the restrictions in our debt instruments or fail to comply with our financial maintenance covenants we will be in default under those instruments which in some cases would cause the maturity of a substantial portion of our longterm indebtedness to be accelerated furthermore if the limits on our ability to pay dividends prevent us from satisfying our reit distribution requirements we could fail to remain qualified for taxation as a reit if these limits do not jeopardize our qualification for taxation as a reit but nevertheless prevent us from distributing 100 of our reit taxable income we will be subject to federal and state corporate income taxes and potentially a nondeductible excise tax on our undistributed taxable income if our operating subsidiaries were to default on their debt the trustee could seek to foreclose the collateral securing such debt in which case we could lose the communications infrastructure and the revenues associated with such communications infrastructure see item 7 mda—liquidity and capital resources—debt covenants  for a further discussion of our debt covenants 

ccic is a holding company that conducts all of its operations through its subsidiaries accordingly ccics sources of cash to pay interest or principal on its outstanding indebtedness are distributions relating to its respective ownership interests in its subsidiaries from the net earnings and cash flows generated by such subsidiaries or from proceeds of debt or equity offerings earnings and cash flows generated by ccics subsidiaries are first applied by such subsidiaries to conduct their operations including servicing their respective debt obligations after which any excess cash flows generally may be paid to such holding company in the absence of any special conditions such as a continuing event of default however ccics subsidiaries are legally distinct from the holding company and unless they guarantee such debt have no obligation to pay amounts due on their debt or to make funds available to us for such payment 

if we fail to pay scheduled dividends on our 6875 convertible preferred stock in cash common stock or any combination of cash and common stock we will be prohibited from paying dividends on our common stock which may jeopardize our status as a reit 

we have a substantial amount of indebtedness in the event we do not repay or refinance such indebtedness we could face substantial liquidity issues and might be required to issue equity securities or securities convertible into equity securities or sell some of our assets to meet our debt payment obligations 

we have a substantial amount of indebtedness which upon final maturity we will need to refinance or repay see item 7 mda—liquidity and capital resources  for a tabular presentation of our contractual debt maturities there can be no assurances we will be able to refinance our indebtedness 1 on commercially reasonable terms 2 on terms including with respect to interest rates as favorable as our current debt or 3 at all 

economic conditions and the credit markets have historically experienced and may continue to experience periods of volatility uncertainty or weakness that could impact the availability or cost of debt financing including any refinancing of the obligations described above or on our ability to draw the full amount of our 425 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility under our 2016 credit facility 2016 revolver that as of february 22 2019  has 41 billion of undrawn availability 

borrowings under our 2016 credit facility generally bear an interest rate based on the london interbank offered rate libor per annum plus a credit spread based on our senior unsecured credit rating in july 2017 the united kingdoms financial conduct authority which regulates libor announced that it will stop compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of libor after 2021 it is not possible to predict the effect of these changes other reforms or the establishment of 

 12 

alternative reference rates the discontinuation or modification of libor could result in interest rate increases on our debt which could adversely affect our cash flow and operating results 

if we are unable to repay or refinance our debt we cannot guarantee that we will be able to generate enough cash flows from operations or that we will be able to obtain enough capital to service our debt fund our planned capital expenditures or pay future dividends in such an event we could face substantial liquidity issues and might be required to issue equity securities or securities convertible into equity securities or sell some of our assets to meet our debt payment obligations failure to repay or refinance indebtedness when required could result in a default under such indebtedness if we incur additional indebtedness any such indebtedness could exacerbate the risks described above 

sales or issuances of a substantial number of shares of our common stock or securities convertible into shares of our common stock may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

future sales or issuances of common stock or other equity related securities may adversely affect the market price of our common stock including any shares of our common stock issued to finance capital expenditures finance acquisitions or repay debt our business strategy contemplates access to external financing to fund certain discretionary investments which may include issuances of common stock or other equity related securities we maintain an atthemarket stock offering program 2018 atm program through which we may from time to time issue and sell shares of our common stock having an aggregate gross sales price of up to 750 million to or through sales agents as of february 22 2019  we had approximately 750 million  of gross sales of common stock remaining under our 2018 atm program from time to time we may refresh or implement a new atthemarket stock offering program see note 11  to our consolidated financial statements as of february 22 2019  we had approximately 416  million shares of common stock outstanding 

we have reserved 10 million  and 17 million shares of common stock respectively for issuance in connection with awards granted under our various stock compensation plans and our 6875 convertible preferred stock which will automatically convert into common stock on august 1 2020 see item 7 mda—liquidity and capital resources—mandatory convertible preferred stock the dividends on our 6875 convertible preferred stock may also be paid in cash or subject to certain limitations shares of common stock or any combination of cash and shares of common stock 

further a small number of common stockholders own a significant percentage of our outstanding common stock if any one of these common stockholders or any group of our common stockholders sells a large quantity of shares of our common stock or the public market perceives that existing common stockholders might sell a large quantity of shares of our common stock the market price of our common stock may significantly decline 

as a result of competition in our industry we may find it more difficult to negotiate favorable rates on our new or renewing tenant contracts 

our growth is dependent on our entering into new tenant contracts including amendments to contracts upon modification of an existing tower fiber or small cell installation as well as renewing or renegotiating tenant contracts when existing tenant contracts terminate competition in our industry may make it more difficult for us to attract new tenants maintain or increase our gross margins or maintain or increase our market share in addition competition primarily in our fiber solutions business may in certain circumstances cause us to renegotiate certain existing tenant contracts to avoid early contract terminations we face competition for site rental tenants and associated contractual rates from various sources including 1 other independent communications infrastructure owners or operators including those that own operate or manage towers rooftops broadcast towers utility poles fiber including nontraditional competitors such as cable providers or small cells or 2 new alternative deployment methods for communications infrastructure 

our fiber operations may have different competitors than our towers business including other owners of fiber as well as new entrants into small cells and fiber solutions some of which may have larger networks or greater financial resources than we have 

new technologies may reduce demand for our communications infrastructure or negatively impact our revenues 

improvements in the efficiency architecture and design of communication networks may reduce the demand for our communications infrastructure for example new technologies that may promote network sharing joint development wireless backhaul or resale agreements by our tenants such as signal combining technologies or network functions virtualization may reduce the need for our communications infrastructure in addition other technologies such as wifi distributed antenna systems das femtocells other small cells or satellite such as low earth orbiting and mesh transmission systems may in the future serve as substitutes for or alternatives to leasing on communications infrastructure that might otherwise be anticipated or expected had such technologies not existed in addition new technologies that enhance the range efficiency and capacity of communication equipment could reduce demand for our communications infrastructure any significant reduction in demand for our 

 13 

communications infrastructure resulting from the new technologies may negatively impact our revenues or otherwise have a material adverse effect on us 

if we fail to retain rights to our communications infrastructure including the land interests under our towers and the rightofway and other agreements related to our small cells and fiber solutions our business may be adversely affected 

the property interests on which our communications infrastructure resides including the land interests under our towers consist of leasehold and subleasehold interests fee interests easements licenses and rightsofway a loss of these interests may interfere with our ability to conduct our business or generate revenues for various reasons we may not always have the ability to access analyze or verify all information regarding titles or other issues prior to acquiring communications infrastructure further we may not be able to renew ground leases or other agreements on commercially viable terms 

our ability to retain rights to the land interests on which our towers reside depends on our ability to purchase such land including fee interests and perpetual easements or renegotiate or extend the terms of the leases relating to such land approximately 10  of our towers site rental gross margin for the year ended december 31 2018  was derived from towers where the leases for the interests under such towers had final expiration dates of less than 10 years if we are unable to retain rights to the property interests on which our communications infrastructure resides our business may be adversely affected 

as of december 31 2018  approximately 53  of our towers were leased or subleased or operated and managed under master leases subleases or other agreements with att sprint and tmobile we have the option to purchase these towers at the end of their respective lease terms we have no obligation to exercise such purchase options we may not have the required available capital to exercise our right to purchase some or all of these towers at the time these options are exercisable even if we do have available capital we may choose not to exercise our right to purchase these towers or some or all of the tmobile or att towers for business or other reasons in the event that we do not exercise these purchase rights or are otherwise unable to acquire an interest that would allow us to continue to operate these towers after the applicable period we will lose the cash flows derived from such towers which may have a material adverse effect on our business in the event that we decide to exercise these purchase rights the benefits of the acquisition of these towers may not exceed the costs which could adversely affect our business additional information concerning these towers and the applicable purchase options as of december 31 2018  is as follows 

 under master lease or master prepaid lease arrangements we have with att sprint and tmobile certain of our subsidiaries lease or sublease or are otherwise granted the right to manage and operate towers from bankruptcy remote subsidiaries of such carriers if one of these bankruptcy remote subsidiaries should become a debtor in a bankruptcy proceeding and is permitted to reject the underlying ground lease our subsidiaries could lose their interest in the applicable sites if our subsidiaries were to lose their interest in the applicable sites or if the applicable ground leases were to be terminated we would lose the cash flow derived from the towers on those sites which may have a material adverse effect on our business we have similar bankruptcy risks with respect to sites that we operate under management agreements 

for our small cells and fiber solutions we must maintain rightsofway franchise pole attachment conduit use and other agreements to operate our assets for various reasons we may not always have the ability to maintain these agreements or obtain future agreements to construct maintain and operate our fiber assets access to rightsofway may depend on our clec status and we cannot be certain that jurisdictions will 1 recognize such clec status or 2 not change their laws concerning clec 

 14 

access to rightsofway if a material portion of these agreements are terminated or are not renewed we might be forced to abandon our assets which may adversely impact our business in order to operate our assets we must also maintain fiber agreements that we have with public and private entities there is no assurance that we will be able to renew those agreements on favorable terms or at all if we are unable to renew those agreements on favorable terms we may face increased costs or reduced revenues 

additionally in order to expand our communications infrastructure footprint to new locations we often need to obtain new or additional rightsofway and other agreements our failure to obtain these agreements in a prompt and costeffective manner may prevent us from expanding our footprint which may be necessary to meet our contractual obligations to our tenants and could adversely impact our business 

our services business has historically experienced significant volatility in demand which reduces the predictability of our results 

the operating results of our services business for any particular period may vary significantly and should not necessarily be considered indicative of longerterm results for this activity our services business is generally driven by demand for our communications infrastructure and may be adversely impacted by various factors including 

 new wireless technologies may not deploy or be adopted by tenants as rapidly or in the manner projected 

there can be no assurances that new wireless services or technologies will be introduced or deployed as rapidly or in the manner projected by the wireless carriers in addition demand or tenant adoption rates for such new technologies may be lower or slower than anticipated for numerous reasons as a result growth opportunities or demand for our communications infrastructure arising from such technologies may not be realized at the times or to the extent anticipated 

if we fail to comply with laws or regulations which regulate our business and which may change at any time we may be fined or even lose our right to conduct some of our business 

a variety of federal state local and foreign laws and regulations apply to our business including those discussed in item 1 business   failure to comply with applicable requirements may lead to civil or criminal penalties require us to assume indemnification obligations or breach contractual provisions we cannot guarantee that existing or future laws or regulations including federal state local or foreign tax laws will not adversely affect our business including our reit status increase delays or result in additional costs we also may incur additional costs as a result of liabilities under applicable laws and regulations such as those governing environmental and safety matters these factors may have a material adverse effect on us 

if radio frequency emissions from wireless handsets or equipment on our communications infrastructure are demonstrated to cause negative health effects potential future claims could adversely affect our operations costs or revenues 

the potential connection between radio frequency emissions and certain negative health effects including some forms of cancer has been the subject of substantial study by the scientific community in recent years we cannot guarantee that claims relating to radio frequency emissions will not arise in the future or that the results of such studies will not be adverse to us 

public perception of possible health risks associated with cellular or other wireless connectivity services may slow or diminish the growth of wireless companies which may in turn slow or diminish our growth in particular negative public perception of and regulations regarding these perceived health risks may slow or diminish the market acceptance of wireless services if a connection between radio frequency emissions and possible negative health effects were established our operations costs or revenues may be materially and adversely affected we currently do not maintain any significant insurance with respect to these matters 

 15 

certain provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation charter amended and restated bylaws bylaws and operative agreements and domestic and international competition laws may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us or for us to acquire control of a third party even if such a change in control would be beneficial to our stockholders 

we have a number of antitakeover devices in place that will hinder takeover attempts or may reduce the market value of our common stock our antitakeover provisions include 

 our bylaws permit special meetings of the stockholders to be called only upon the request of our chief executive officer or a majority of the board of directors and deny stockholders the ability to call such meetings such provisions as well as the provisions of section 203 of the delaware general corporation law may impede a merger consolidation takeover or other business combination or discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us 

in addition domestic or international competition laws may prevent or discourage us from acquiring communications infrastructure in certain geographical areas or impede a merger consolidation takeover or other business combination or discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us 

we may be vulnerable to security breaches or other unforeseen events that could adversely affect our operations business and reputation 

despite existing security measures certain of our communications infrastructure may be vulnerable to damage disruptions or shutdowns due to unauthorized access computer viruses cyberattacks and other security breaches an attack attempt or security breach such as a distributed denial of service attack could potentially result in 1 interruption or cessation of certain of our services to our tenants 2 our inability to meet expected levels of service to our tenants or 3 data transmitted over our tenants networks being compromised we cannot guarantee that our security measures will not be circumvented resulting in tenant network failures or interruptions that could impact our tenants network availability and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or operational results additionally security incidents impacting our tenants vendors and business partners could result in a material adverse effect on our business we may be required to expend significant resources to protect against or recover from such threats we maintain an insurance policy that includes coverage over cyberattacks and other security breaches however there can be no assurances that such coverage will be adequate to cover exposure for such incidents if an actual or perceived breach of our security occurs the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed and we could lose tenants further the perpetrators of cyberattacks are not restricted to particular groups or persons these attacks may be committed by our employees or external actors operating in any geography in addition our acquisitions both past and future may alter our potential exposure to the risks described aboveadditionally we could be negatively impacted by other unforeseen events such as natural disasters which could among other things damage our communication infrastructure assets or interrupt service to our tenants any such events could result in legal claims or penalties disruption in operations misappropriation of sensitive data damage to our reputation negative market perception or costly response measures which could adversely affect our business 

risks relating to our reit status 

future dividend payments to our stockholders will reduce the availability of our cash on hand available to fund future discretionary investments and may result in a need to incur indebtedness or issue equity securities to fund growth opportunities in such event the then current economic credit market or equity market conditions will impact the availability or cost of such financing which may hinder our ability to grow our per share results of operations 

during each of the first three quarters of 2018  we paid a common stock dividend of 105 per share totaling approximately 13 billion in october 2018  our board of directors declared a quarterly common stock dividend of 1125 per share which represents an increase of 7 from an annualized amount of 420 per share to an annualized amount of 450 per share from the quarterly common stock dividend declared during each of the first three quarters of 2018 we currently expect our anticipated common stock cash dividends over the next 12 months to be a cumulative amount of at least 450 per share or an aggregate amount of approximately 19 billion over time we expect to increase our dividend per share generally commensurate with our realized growth in cash flows any future dividends are subject to declaration by our board of directors see notes 11  and 18  to our consolidated financial statements 

 16 

we operate as a reit for us federal income tax purposes to remain qualified and be taxed as a reit we will generally be required to annually distribute at least 90 of our reit taxable income determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction excluding net capital gain and after the utilization of any available nols to our stockholders our quarterly cash common stock dividend will delay the utilization of our nols and may cause certain of the nols to expire without utilization see also item 7 mda—general overview—common stock dividend  and item 1 business—company developments reit status and industry update—reit status 

as discussed in item 1 mda—business—strategy  we seek to invest our available capital including the net cash provided by our operating activities and external financing sources in a manner that we believe will increase longterm stockholder value on a riskadjusted basis our historical discretionary investments have included the following in no particular order construction of communications infrastructure acquisitions of communications infrastructure acquisitions of land interests which primarily relate to land assets under towers improvements and structural enhancements to our existing communications infrastructure purchases of shares of our common stock from time to time and purchases repayments or redemptions of our debt external financing including debt equity and equityrelated issuances to fund future discretionary investments either 1 may not be available to us or 2 may not be accessible by us at terms that would result in the investment of the net proceeds raised yielding incremental growth in our per share operating results as a result future dividend payments may hinder our ability to grow our per share results of operations or otherwise adversely affect our ability to execute our business plan 

remaining qualified to be taxed as a reit involves highly technical and complex provisions of the code failure to remain qualified as a reit would result in our inability to deduct dividends to stockholders when computing our taxable income which would reduce our available cash 

we operate as a reit for us federal tax purposes as a reit we are generally entitled to a deduction for dividends that we pay and therefore are not subject to us federal corporate income tax on our net taxable income that is currently distributed to our common stockholders 

while we intend to operate so that we remain qualified as a reit given the highly complex nature of the rules governing reits the importance of ongoing factual determinations the possibility of future changes in our circumstances and the potential impact of future changes to laws and regulations impacting reits no assurance can be given that we will qualify as a reit for any particular year 

we do not expect the tax reform act to significantly affect us although we cannot predict with certainty how such legislation will affect us in the future in addition the present us federal tax treatment of reits is subject to change possibly with retroactive effect by legislative judicial or administrative action at any time and any such change might adversely affect our reit status or benefits we cannot predict the impact if any that such changes if enacted might have on our business however it is possible that such changes could adversely affect our business including our reit status 

if in any taxable year we fail to qualify for taxation as a reit and are not entitled to relief under certain provisions of the the code then 

 although we may have federal nols available to reduce any taxable income to the extent our federal nols have been utilized or are otherwise unavailable any such corporate tax liability could be substantial would reduce the amount of cash available for other purposes and might necessitate the borrowing of additional funds or the liquidation of some investments to pay any additional tax liability accordingly funds available for investment would be reduced 

under the code for taxable years beginning in or after 2018 no more than 20 of the value of the assets of a reit may be represented by securities of one or more trss these limitations may affect our ability to make additional investments in nonreit qualifying operations or assets or in any operations held through trss the net income of our trss is not required to be distributed to us and income that is not distributed to us generally will not be subject to the reit income distribution requirement however there may be limitations on our ability to accumulate earnings in our trss and the accumulation or reinvestment of significant earnings in our trss could result in adverse tax treatment in particular if the accumulation of cash in our trss causes the fair market value of our securities in our trss to exceed current or future limitations of the fair market value of our assets at the end of any quarter then we may fail to remain qualified as a reit 

 17 

if we fail to pay scheduled dividends on our 6875 convertible preferred stock in cash common stock or any combination of cash and common stock we will be prohibited from paying dividends on our common stock which may jeopardize our status as a reit 

the terms of the 6875 convertible preferred stock provide that unless accumulated dividends have been paid or set aside for payment on all outstanding 6875 convertible preferred stock for all past dividend periods no dividends may be declared or paid on our common stock if that were to occur the inability to pay dividends on our common stock might jeopardize our status as a reit for us federal income tax purposes see note 11 to our consolidated financial statements 

complying with reit requirements including the 90 distribution requirement may limit our flexibility or cause us to forgo otherwise attractive opportunities including certain discretionary investments and potential financing alternatives 

to remain qualified and be taxed as a reit we are required to satisfy the 90 distribution requirement as described above we commenced declaring regular quarterly dividends to our common stockholders beginning with the first quarter of 2014 see notes 11  and 18  to our consolidated financial statements any such dividends however are subject to the determination of and declaration by our board of directors based on thencurrent and anticipated future conditions including our earnings net cash provided by operating activities capital requirements financial condition our relative market capitalization our existing federal nols of approximately 15 billion  or other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors 

to the extent that we satisfy the 90 distribution requirement but distribute less than 100 of our reit taxable income determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction excluding net capital gain and after the utilization of any available nols we will be subject to federal corporate income tax on our undistributed taxable income in addition we will be subject to a 4 nondeductible excise tax if the actual amount that we pay out to our stockholders for a calendar year is less than a minimum amount specified under the code 

from time to time we may generate reit taxable income greater than our cash flow as a result of differences in timing between the recognition of taxable income and the actual receipt of cash or the effect of nondeductible capital expenditures the creation of reserves or required debt or amortization payments if we do not have other funds available in these situations we could be required to borrow funds on unfavorable terms sell assets at disadvantageous prices or distribute amounts that would otherwise be invested in future acquisitions to make distributions sufficient to enable us to pay out enough of our taxable income to satisfy the reit dividend requirement and to avoid corporate income tax and the 4 excise tax in a particular year these alternatives could increase our costs or reduce our equity thus compliance with the reit requirements may hinder our ability to grow which could adversely affect the value of our common stock furthermore the reit dividend requirements may increase the financing we need to fund capital expenditures future growth or expansion initiatives which would increase our total leverage 

in addition to satisfying the 90 distribution requirement to remain qualified as a reit for tax purposes we will need to continually satisfy tests concerning among other things the sources of our income the nature and diversification of our assets and the ownership of our capital stock compliance with these tests will require us to refrain from certain activities and may hinder our ability to make certain attractive investments including the purchase of nonqualifying assets the expansion of nonreal estate activities or investments in the businesses to be conducted by our trss and to that extent limit our opportunities and our flexibility to change our business strategy furthermore acquisition opportunities in domestic or international markets may be adversely affected if we need or require the target company to comply with some reit requirements prior to completing any such acquisition in addition our conversion to a reit may result in investor pressures not to pursue growth opportunities that are not immediately accretive

liquidity and capital resources 

overview 

general  our core business generates revenues under longterm contracts see item 1 business—overview and item 7 mda—general overview—overview  from the largest us wireless carriers and fiber solutions tenants as a leading provider of shared communications infrastructure in the us our strategy is to create longterm stockholder value via a combination of 1 growing cash flows generated from our portfolio of communications infrastructure 2 returning a meaningful portion of our cash provided by operating activities to our stockholders in the form of dividends and 3 investing capital efficiently to grow cash flows and longterm dividends per share our us focused strategy is based in part on our belief that the us is the most attractive market for shared communications infrastructure investment with the greatest longterm growth potential we measure our efforts to create longterm stockholder value by the combined payment of dividends to stockholders and growth in our per share results see item 1 business—strategy  for a further discussion of our strategy 

we have engaged and expect to continue to engage in discretionary investments that we believe will maximize longterm stockholder value our historical discretionary investments include in no particular order constructing communications infrastructure acquiring communications infrastructure acquiring land interests which primarily relate to land assets under towers improving and structurally enhancing our existing communications infrastructure purchasing shares of our common stock and purchasing repaying or redeeming our debt we have recently spent and expect to continue to spend a significant percentage of our discretionary investments on the construction of new small cells and fiber we seek to fund our discretionary investments with both net cash provided by operating activities and cash available from financing capacity such as the use of our undrawn availability from the 2016 revolver debt financings and issuances of equity or equity related securities including under our 2018 atm program 

we seek to maintain a capital structure that we believe drives longterm stockholder value and optimizes our weightedaverage cost of capital we target a leverage ratio of approximately four to five times adjusted ebitda and interest coverage of adjusted ebitda to interest expense of approximately three times subject to various factors such as the availability and cost of 

 31 

capital and the potential longterm return on our discretionary investments we may choose to increase or decrease our leverage or coverage from these targets for various periods of time we have no significant contractual debt maturities until 2021 other than principal payments on certain outstanding debt

 summary cash flows information   



operating activities the increase in net cash provided by operating activities for 2018  from 2017  was due primarily to growth in our core business including the lightower acquisition and wilcon acquisition offset by a net decrease from changes in working capital the increase in net cash provided by operating activities for 2017  from 2016  was due primarily to growth in our core business including the 2017 acquisitions and a net benefit from changes in working capital changes in working capital contribute to variability in net cash provided by operating activities largely due to the timing of advanced payments by us and advanced receipts from tenants we expect to grow our net cash provided by operating activities in the future exclusive of movements in working capital if we realize expected growth in our core business

accounting and reporting matters 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the following is a discussion of the accounting policies and estimates in effect for 2018 that we believe 1 are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations or 2 require our most difficult subjective or complex judgments often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain the critical accounting policies and estimates for 2018  are not intended to be a comprehensive list of our accounting policies and estimates see note 2  to our consolidated financial statements for a summary of our significant accounting policies in many cases the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically prescribed by gaap in other cases management is required to exercise judgment in the application of accounting principles with respect to particular transactions 

revenue recognition   87  of our total revenue for 2018  consists of site rental revenues which are recognized on a ratable basis over the fixed noncancelable term of the relevant contract generally ranging from five to 15 years for site rental revenues derived from wireless tenants and three to 20 years for site rental revenues derived from our fiber solutions business regardless of whether the payments from the tenant are received in equal monthly amounts during the life of a contract certain of our contracts contain fixed escalation clauses such as fixeddollar or fixedpercentage increases or inflationbased escalation clauses such as those tied to the consumer price index if the payment terms call for fixed escalations upfront payments or rent free periods the revenue is recognized on a straightline basis over the fixed noncancelable term of the contract when calculating our straightline rental revenues we consider all fixed elements of tenant contractual escalation provisions even if such escalation provisions contain a variable element such as an escalator tied to an inflationbased index in addition to a minimum to the extent we acquire belowmarket tenant leases for contractual interests with tenants on the acquired communications infrastructure for example with respect to small cells and fiber we record the fair value as deferred credits and amortize such deferred credits to site rental revenues over their estimated lease term since we recognize revenue on a straightline basis a portion of the site rental revenue in a given period represents cash collected or contractually collectible in other periods our assets related to straightline site rental revenues are included in other current assets and deferred site rental receivables amounts billed or received prior to being earned are deferred and reflected in deferred revenues and other longterm liabilities amounts to which we have an unconditional right to payment which are related to both satisfied or partially satisfied performance obligations are recorded within receivables net on the consolidated balance sheet 

as part of our effort to provide comprehensive communications infrastructure solutions we also offer certain services primarily relating to our communications infrastructure which represent 13  of our total revenues for 2018  services and other revenue consists of 1 site development services primarily relating to existing or new tenant equipment installations on our towers 

 37 

and small cells including site acquisition architectural and engineering or zoning and permitting collectively site development services and 2 tenant equipment installation or subsequent augmentations collectively installation services upon contract commencement we assess our services to tenants and identify performance obligations for each promise to provide a distinct service 

we may have multiple performance obligations for site development services which primarily include structural analysis zoning permitting and construction drawings for each of the above performance obligations services revenues are recognized at completion of the applicable performance obligation which represents the point at which we believe we have transferred goods or services to the tenant the revenue recognized is based on an allocation of the transaction price among the performance obligations in a respective contract based on estimated standalone selling price we have one performance obligation for installation services which is satisfied at the time of the respective installation or augmentation since performance obligations are typically satisfied prior to receiving payment from tenants the unconditional right to payment is recorded within receivables net on our consolidated balance sheet 

the vast majority of our services revenues relates to our towers segment and generally have a duration of one year or less see notes 2  to our consolidated financial statements 

accounting for acquisitions — general as described in  item 1 business  the majority of our communications infrastructure has been acquired directly or indirectly from the four largest wireless carriers or their predecessors through transactions consummated since 1999 we evaluate each of our acquisitions to determine if it should be accounted for as a business combination or as an acquisition of assets for our business combinations we allocate the purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair value at the date of acquisition any purchase price in excess of the net fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is allocated to goodwill see item 7 mda—accounting and reporting matters—accounting for acquisitions—valuation below and note 2  to our consolidated financial statements 

the determination of the final purchase price allocation could extend over several quarters resulting in the use of preliminary estimates that are subject to adjustment until finalized such changes could have a significant impact on our financial statements 

accounting for acquisitions — leases with respect to business combinations that include towers that we lease and operate such as the att tmobile and sprint leased and subleased towers we evaluate such agreements to determine treatment as capital or operating leases the evaluation of such agreements for capital or operating lease treatment includes consideration of each of the lease classification criteria under asc 8401025 namely 1 the transfer of ownership provisions 2 the existence of bargain purchase options 3 the length of the remaining lease term and 4 the present value of the minimum lease payments with respect to the att acquisition tmobile acquisition and the sprint towers acquired in the global signal acquisition we determined that the tower leases were capital leases and the underlying land leases were operating leases based upon the lease term criterion after considering the fragmentation criteria applicable under asc 8401025 to leases involving both land and buildings ie towers we determined that the fragmentation criteria was met and the tower leases could be accounted for as capital leases apart from the land leases which are accounted for as operating leases since 1 the fair value of the land in the aforementioned business combinations was greater than 25 of the total fair value of the leased property at inception and 2 the tower lease expirations occur beyond 75 of the estimated economic life of the tower assets 

effective january 1 2019 we adopted new lease accounting guidance on the recognition measurement presentation and disclosure of leases see note 2  to our consolidated financial statements for further information 

accounting for acquisitions — valuation  as of december 31 2018  our largest asset was property and equipment which primarily consists of communications infrastructure followed by goodwill and intangible assets our identifiable intangible assets predominately relate to the site rental contracts and tenant relationships intangible assets see note 2  to our consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the nature and composition of the site rental contracts and tenant relationships intangible assets 

the fair value of the vast majority of our assets and liabilities is determined by using either 

 the purchase price allocation requires subjective estimates that if incorrectly estimated could be material to our consolidated financial statements including the amount of depreciation amortization and accretion expense the most important estimates for measurement of tangible fixed assets are 1 the cost to replace the asset with a new asset and 2 the economic useful life after giving effect to age quality and condition the most important estimates for measurement of intangible assets are 1 discount rates and 2 timing and amount of cash flows including estimates regarding tenant renewals and cancellations the most important 

 38 

estimates for measurement of above and belowmarket leases is the determination of 1 favorability or unfavorability to the current market terms and 2 applicable lease term including whether renewals or extensions should be measured with respect to business combinations that include towers that we lease and operate such as the tmobile sprint and att leased and subleased towers we evaluate such agreements to determine treatment as capital or operating leases and identification of any bargain purchase options 

we record the fair value of obligations to perform certain asset retirement activities including requirements pursuant to our ground lease easements and leased facility agreements to remove communications infrastructure or remediate the space upon which certain of our communications infrastructure resides in determining the fair value of these asset retirement obligations we must make several subjective and highly judgmental estimates such as those related to 1 timing of cash flows 2 future costs 3 discount rates and 4 the probability of enforcement to remove the towers or small cells or remediate the land see note 2  to our consolidated financial statements 

accounting for longlived assets — useful lives  we are required to make subjective assessments as to the useful lives of our tangible and intangible assets for purposes of determining depreciation amortization and accretion expense that if incorrectly estimated could be material to our consolidated financial statements depreciation expense for our property and equipment is computed using the straightline method over the estimated useful lives of our various classes of tangible assets the substantial portion of our property and equipment represents the cost of our communications infrastructure which is depreciated with an estimated useful life equal to the shorter of 1 20 years or 2 the term of the lease including optional renewals for the land interests under the communications infrastructure 

the useful life of our intangible assets is estimated based on the period over which the intangible asset is expected to benefit us and gives consideration to the expected useful life of other assets to which the useful life may relate we review the expected useful lives of our intangible assets on an ongoing basis and adjust if necessary amortization expense for intangible assets is computed using the straightline method over the estimated useful life of each of the intangible assets the useful life of the site rental contracts and tenant relationships intangible assets is limited by the maximum depreciable life of the communications infrastructure 20 years as a result of the interdependency of the communications infrastructure and site rental contracts and tenant relationships in contrast the site rental contracts and tenant relationships are estimated to provide economic benefits for several decades because of the low rate of tenant cancellations and high rate of renewals experienced to date thus while site rental contracts and tenant relationships are valued based upon the fair value of the site rental contracts and tenant relationships which includes assumptions regarding both 1 tenants exercise of optional renewals contained in the acquired leases and 2 renewals of the acquired leases past the contractual term including exercisable options the site rental contracts are amortized over a period not to exceed 20 years as a result of the useful life being limited by the depreciable life of the communications infrastructure 

accounting for longlived assets — impairment evaluation  we review the carrying values of property and equipment intangible assets or other longlived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable we utilize the following dual grouping policy for purposes of determining the unit of account for testing impairment of the site rental contracts and tenant relationships 

 we first pool site rental contracts and tenant relationships intangible assets and property and equipment into portfolio groups for purposes of determining the unit of account for impairment testing because we view communications infrastructure as portfolios and communications infrastructure in a given portfolio and its related tenant contracts are not largely independent of the other communications infrastructure in the portfolio we reevaluate the appropriateness of the pooled groups at least annually this use of grouping is based in part on 1 our limitations regarding disposal of communications infrastructure 2 the interdependencies of communications infrastructure portfolios and 3 the manner in which communications infrastructure is traded in the marketplace the vast majority of our site rental contracts and tenant relationships intangible assets and property and equipment are pooled into the us owned communications infrastructure group secondly and separately we pool site rental contracts and tenant relationships by significant tenant or by tenant grouping for individually insignificant tenants as appropriate for purposes of determining the unit of account for impairment testing because we associate the value ascribed to site rental contracts and tenant relationships intangible assets to the underlying contracts and related tenant relationships acquired 

our determination that an adverse event or change in circumstance has occurred that indicates that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable will generally involve 1 a deterioration in an assets financial performance compared to historical results 2 a shortfall in an assets financial performance compared to forecasted results or 3 changes affecting the utility and estimated future 

 39 

demands for the asset when considering the utility of our assets we consider events that would meaningfully impact 1 our communications infrastructure or 2 our tenant relationships for example consideration would be given to events that impact 1 the structural integrity and longevity of our communications infrastructure or 2 our ability to derive benefit from our existing tenant relationships including events such as tenants bankruptcy or insolvency or loss of a significant tenant during 2018  there were no events or circumstances that caused us to review the carrying value of our intangible assets or property and equipment due in part to our assets performing consistently with or better than our expectations 

if the sum of the estimated future cash flows undiscounted from an asset or portfolio group significant tenant or tenant group for individually insignificant tenants as applicable is less than its carrying amount an impairment loss may be recognized if the carrying value were to exceed the undiscounted cash flows measurement of an impairment loss would be based on the fair value of the asset which is based on an estimate of discounted future cash flows the most important estimates for such calculations of undiscounted cash flows are 1 the expected additions of new tenants and equipment on our communications infrastructure and 2 estimates regarding tenant cancellations and renewals of contracts we could record impairments in the future if changes in longterm market conditions expected future operating results or the utility of the assets results in changes for our impairment test calculations which negatively impact the fair value of our property and equipment and intangible assets or if we changed our unit of account in the future 

approximately 2  of our total towers currently have no tenants we continue to pay operating expenses on these towers in anticipation of obtaining tenants on these towers in the future primarily because of the individual tower site demographics we estimate based on current visibility potential tenants on approximately half of these towers to the extent we do not believe there are longterm prospects of obtaining tenants on an individual asset and all other possible avenues for recovering the carrying value has been exhausted including sale of the asset we appropriately reduce the carrying value of such assets to fair value 

accounting for goodwill — impairment evaluation  we test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis regardless of whether adverse events or changes in circumstances have occurred the annual test begins with goodwill and all intangible assets being allocated to applicable reporting units we then perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount if we conclude that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount we would be required to perform the twostep goodwill impairment test otherwise the twostep goodwill impairment test is not required our reporting units are the same as our operating segments towers and fiber see note 15  we performed our most recent annual goodwill impairment test as of october 1 2018  which resulted in 1 the fair value of our reporting units substantially exceeding the carrying value and 2 no impairments 

deferred income taxes  we operate as a reit for us federal income tax purposes our reit taxable income is generally not subject to federal and state income taxes as a result of the deduction for dividends paid and any usage of our remaining nols accordingly the only provision or benefit for federal income taxes for the year ended december 31 2018  relates to trss furthermore as a result of the deduction for dividends paid some or all of our nols related to our reit may expire without utilization see  item 1 business—company developments reit status and industry update—reit status  for a discussion of the impact of our reit status 

our trss will continue to be subject as applicable to federal and state income taxes and foreign taxes in the jurisdictions in which such assets and operations are located our ability to utilize our nols is dependent in part upon us having sufficient future earnings to utilize our nols before they expire if market conditions change materially and we determine that we will be unable to generate sufficient taxable income in the future to utilize our nols we would be required to record an additional valuation allowance which would reduce our earnings such adjustments could cause a material effect on our results of operations for the period of the adjustment the change in our valuation allowance has no effect on our cash flows for a further discussion of our benefit provision for income taxes see item 7 mda—results of operations  and note 10  to our consolidated financial statements

nongaap and segment financial measures 

in addition to the nongaap financial measures used herein and as discussed in note 15  to our consolidated financial statements we also provide 1 segment site rental gross margin 2 segment services and other gross margin and 3 segment operating profit which are key measures used by management to evaluate the performance of our operating segments  these segment measures are provided pursuant to gaap requirements related to segment reporting 

 40 

we define segment site rental gross margin as segment site rental revenues less segment site rental cost of operations which excludes stockbased compensation expense and prepaid lease purchase price adjustments recorded in consolidated site rental cost of operations we define segment services and other gross margin as segment services and other revenues less segment services and other cost of operations which excludes stockbased compensation expense recorded in consolidated services and other cost of operations we define segment operating profit as segment site rental gross margin plus segment services and other gross margin less selling general and administrative expenses attributable to the respective segment all of these measurements of profit or loss are exclusive of depreciation amortization and accretion which are shown separately 

we use earnings before interest taxes depreciation amortization and accretion as adjusted adjusted ebitda which is a nongaap financial measure as an indicator of consolidated financial performance our measure of adjusted ebitda may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies including companies in the communications infrastructure sector or other reits and is not a measure of performance calculated in accordance with gaap adjusted ebitda should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for operating income loss net income loss net cash provided by used for operating investing and financing activities or other income statement or cash flow statement data prepared in accordance with gaap and should be considered only as a supplement to net income loss computed in accordance with gaap as a measure of our performance there are material limitations to using a measure such as adjusted ebitda including the difficulty associated with comparing results among more than one company including our competitors and the inability to analyze certain significant items including depreciation and interest expense that directly affect our net income or loss management compensates for these limitations by considering the economic effect of the excluded expense items independently as well as in connection with their analysis of net income loss 

we define adjusted ebitda as net income loss plus restructuring charges credits asset writedown charges acquisition and integration costs depreciation amortization and accretion amortization of prepaid lease purchase price adjustments interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs gains losses on retirement of longterm obligations net gain loss on interest rate swaps gains losses on foreign currency swaps impairment of availableforsale securities interest income other income expense benefit provision for income taxes cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle income loss from discontinued operations and stockbased compensation expense the reconciliation of adjusted ebitda to our net income loss is set forth below and excludes items in our adjusted ebitda definition which are not applicable to the periods shown 



  

 we believe adjusted ebitda is useful to investors or other interested parties in evaluating our financial performance because 



 41 

 our management uses adjusted ebitda 

 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

our primary exposures to market risks are related to changes in interest rates which may adversely affect our results of operations and financial position we seek to manage exposure to changes in interest rates where economically prudent to do so by utilizing fixed rate debt 

our interest rate risk relates primarily to the impact of interest rate movements on the following after giving effect to our february 2019 senior notes offering and the application of the net proceeds therefrom 

 potential refinancing of existing debt 

we have no debt maturities other than principal payments on amortizing debt or anticipated repayment dates over the next 12 months as of december 31 2018  and december 31 2017  we had no interest rate swaps hedging any refinancings see below for a tabular presentation of our scheduled contractual debt maturities as of december 31 2018  and a discussion of anticipated repayment dates 

floating rate debt 

we manage our exposure to market interest rates on our existing debt by controlling the mix of fixed and floating rate debt as of december 31 2018  after giving effect to our february 2019 senior notes offering and the application of the net proceeds therefrom we had 24 billion of floating rate debt none of which had libor floors as a result a hypothetical unfavorable fluctuation in market interest rates on our existing debt of 18 of a percent point over a 12month period would increase our interest expense by approximately 3 million as of december 31 2017  we had approximately 30 billion of floating rate debt none of which had libor floors 

potential future borrowings of incremental debt 

we typically do not hedge our exposure to interest rates on potential future borrowings of incremental debt for a substantial period prior to issuance see item 7 mda—liquidity and capital resources  regarding our liquidity strategy 

 42 

the following table provides information about our market risk related to changes in interest rates after giving effect to our february 2019 senior notes offering and the application of the net proceeds therefrom the future principal payments and weightedaverage interest rates are presented as of december 31 2018  these debt maturities reflect contractual maturity dates and do not consider the impact of the principal payments that will commence following the anticipated repayment dates of certain debt see footnotes b and d see notes 8  and 18  to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our debt

 item 1 business 

overview 

we own operate and lease shared communications infrastructure that is geographically dispersed throughout the us including 1 approximately 40000  towers and other structures such as rooftops collectively towers and 2 approximately 60000 route miles of fiber primarily supporting small cell networks small cells and fiber solutions our towers fiber and small cells assets are collectively referred to herein as communications infrastructure and our customers on our communications infrastructure are referred to herein as tenants our core business is providing access including space or capacity to our shared communications infrastructure via longterm contracts in various forms including lease license sublease and service agreements collectively contracts we seek to increase our site rental revenues by adding more tenants on our shared communications infrastructure which we expect to result in significant incremental cash flows due to our low incremental operating costs 

below is certain information concerning our business 

 certain information concerning our customers and site rental contracts is as follows 



 1 

 as part of our effort to provide comprehensive communications infrastructure solutions we also offer certain network services primarily relating to our towers and small cells predominately consisting of 1 site development services relating to existing or new tenant equipment installations including site acquisition architectural and engineering or zoning and permitting collectively site development services and 2 tenant equipment installation or subsequent augmentations collectively installation services the large majority of our network services and other revenues relate to our towers segment 

strategy 

as a leading provider of shared communications infrastructure in the us our strategy is to create longterm stockholder value via a combination of 1 growing cash flows generated from our portfolio of communications infrastructure 2 returning a meaningful portion of our cash provided by operating activities to our stockholders in the form of dividends and 3 investing capital efficiently to grow cash flows and longterm dividends per share our us focused strategy is based in part on our belief that the us is the most attractive market for shared communications infrastructure investment with the greatest longterm growth potential we measure our efforts to create longterm stockholder value by the combined payment of dividends to stockholders and growth in our per share results the key elements of our strategy are to 

 our strategy to create longterm stockholder value is based on our belief that additional demand for our communications infrastructure will be created by the expected continued growth in the demand for data we believe that such demand for our communications infrastructure will continue will result in growth of our cash flows due to tenant additions on our existing communications infrastructure and will create other growth opportunities for us such as demand for new communications infrastructure

company developments reit status and industry updates 

company developments  see item 1 business—overview item 1 business—the company item 7 mda  and our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of certain recent developments activities and results including 1 the increase in our quarterly common stock dividend 2 our recent debt and equity financing activities and 3 our january 2017 acquisition of fpl fibernet holdings llc and certain other subsidiaries of nextera energy inc fibernet acquisition our june 2017 acquisition of wilcon holdings llc wilcon acquisition and our november 2017 acquisition of lts group holdings llc lightower acquisition collectively 2017 acquisitions 

reit status  we commenced operating as a reit for us federal income tax purposes effective january 1 2014 as a reit we are generally entitled to a deduction for dividends that we pay and therefore are not subject to us federal corporate income tax on our net taxable income that is currently distributed to our stockholders we may also be subject to certain federal state local and foreign taxes on our income or assets including 1 alternative minimum taxes repealed effective january 1 2018 2 taxes on any undistributed income 3 taxes related to our taxable reit subsidiaries trss 4 franchise taxes 5 property taxes and 6 transfer taxes in addition we could in certain circumstances be required to pay an excise or penalty tax which could be significant in amount in order to utilize one or more relief provisions under the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended code to maintain qualification for taxation as a reit 

the recentlyenacted tax reform act makes substantial changes to the code among the many changes impacting corporations are a significant reduction in the corporate income tax rate repeal of the corporate alternative minimum tax for years beginning in 2018 and limitations on the deductibility of interest expense in addition under the tax reform act qualified reit dividends within the meaning of section 199ae3 of the code constitute a part of a noncorporate taxpayers qualified business income amount and thus our noncorporate us stockholders may be eligible to take a qualified business income deduction in an amount equal to 20 of such dividends received from us without further legislative action the 20 deduction applicable to qualified reit dividends will expire on january 1 2026 we do not expect the tax reform act to materially impact us 

the vast majority of our assets and revenues are in the reit including a substantial amount of our assets and revenues from our 2017 acquisitions see notes 4 and 11 to our consolidated financial statements additionally we have included in trss certain other assets and operations those trs assets and operations will continue to be subject as applicable to federal and state corporate income taxes or to foreign taxes in the jurisdictions in which such assets and operations are located 

our foreign assets and operations including our tower operations in puerto rico most likely will be subject to foreign income taxes in the jurisdictions in which such assets and operations are located regardless of whether they are included in a trs 

to remain qualified and be taxed as a reit we will generally be required to annually distribute to our stockholders at least 90 of our reit taxable income after the utilization of our nols determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding net capital gain see notes 2  and 11  to our consolidated financial statements our quarterly common stock dividend will delay the utilization of our nols and may cause certain of the nols to expire without utilization 

industry update during 2017  consumer demand for data continued to grow due to increases in data consumption and increased penetration of bandwidthintensive devices this increase in data consumption is driven by growth in factors such as 1 mobile entertainment such as mobile video mobile applications and social networking 2 mobile internet usage such as email and web browsing 3 machinetomachine applications or the internet of things such as smart city technologies and 4 the adoption of other bandwidthintensive applications such as cloud services and video communications as a result consumer wireless devices are trending toward bandwidthintensive devices including smartphones laptops tablets and other emerging devices 

we expect the following anticipated factors to contribute to potential demand for our communications infrastructure 



 3 

the company 

virtually all of our operations are located in the us our operating segments consist of towers and fiber for more information about our operating segments see item 7 mda—general overview and note 16  to our consolidated financial statements our core business is providing access including space or capacity to our shared communications infrastructure in the us we believe our communications infrastructure is integral to our customers networks and organizations see item 1 business—strategy 

towers segment   we believe towers are the most efficient and costeffective solution for providing coverage and capacity for wireless carrier network deployments we acquired ownership interests or exclusive rights to the majority of our towers directly or indirectly from the four largest wireless carriers or their predecessors through transactions consummated since 1999 including transactions with 1 att in 2013 att acquisition 2 tmobile in 2012 tmobile acquisition 3 global signal inc in 2007 global signal acquisition which had originally acquired the majority of its towers from sprint 4 companies now part of verizon wireless during 1999 and 2000 and 5 companies now part of att during 1999 and 2000 

we generally receive monthly rental payments from our towers tenants payable under longterm contracts we generally negotiate initial contract terms of five to 15 years with multiple renewal periods of five to 10 years each at the option of the tenant and our contracts typically include fixed escalations which generally exceed expected nonrenewals as discussed below and in some cases an additional upfront payment we continue to endeavor to negotiate with our existing customer base for longer contractual terms which often contain fixed escalation rates 

our towers tenant contracts have historically had a high renewal rate with limited exceptions our towers tenant contracts may not be terminated prior to the end of their current term and nonrenewals have averaged approximately 25 of site rental revenues over the last five years inclusive of nonrenewals as a result of the decommissioning of the former leap wireless metropcs and clearwire networks acquired networks in general each tenant contract which is renewable will automatically renew at the end of its term unless the tenant provides prior notice of its intent not to renew see note 15  to our consolidated financial statements for a tabular presentation of the minimum rental cash payments due to us by tenants pursuant to lease agreements without consideration of tenant renewal options 

the average monthly rental payment from a new tenant added to towers can vary based on 1 aggregate tenant volume 2 the different regions in the us or 3 the physical size weight and shape of the antenna installation or related equipment when possible we seek to receive rental payment increases in connection with contract amendments pursuant to which our tenants add additional antennas or other equipment to our towers on which they already have equipment pursuant to preexisting contracts 

as of december 31 2017  the average number of tenants calculated as a unique license together with any related amendments thereto per tower is approximately 22  the following chart sets forth the number of existing tenants per tower as of december 31 2017  see item 7 mda—accounting and reporting matters—critical accounting policies and estimates  for a discussion of our impairment evaluation and our towers with no tenants 

 4 

fiber segment our fiber segment includes both small cells and fiber solutions 

 our fiber assets include those acquired from 1 nextg networks inc in 2012 nextg acquisition 2 quanta fiber networks inc in 2015 sunesys acquisition and 3 the 2017 acquisitions 

we generally receive monthly recurring payments from our fiber tenants and in some cases receive upfront payments payable pursuant to contracts the amount of the monthly payments can also be influenced by the amount or cost of 1 construction for initial and subsequent tenants 2 fiber strand requirements and supply 3 equipment at the site and 4 any upfront payment received 

for both of our towers and fiber primarily small cells segments we have existing master agreements with our largest customers including att tmobile verizon wireless and sprint such agreements provide certain terms including economic terms that govern our tenants right to utilize our communications infrastructure entered into by such carriers during the term of their master agreements 

approximately 55  of our direct site operating expenses consist of towers ground lease expenses and the remainder includes fiber access expenses primarily leases of fiber assets and other access agreements to facilitate our communications infrastructure property taxes repairs and maintenance employee compensation or related benefit costs and utilities assuming current leasing activity levels our cash operating expenses generally tend to escalate at approximately the rate of inflation the addition of new tenants is achieved at a low incremental operating cost delivering high incremental returns to our business our communications infrastructure portfolio requires minimal sustaining capital expenditures including maintenance or other nondiscretionary capital expenditures which are typically approximately 2  of net revenues see note 15  to our consolidated financial statements for a tabular presentation of the rental cash payments owed by us to landlords pursuant to our contractual agreements 

network services   as part of our effort to provide comprehensive communications infrastructure solutions we also offer certain network services primarily relating to our towers and small cells predominately consisting of 1 site development services and 2 installation services the large majority of our network service and other revenues relate to our towers segment for 2017  approximately 65  of our network services and other revenues related to installation services and the remainder predominately related to site development services we seek to grow our network service and other revenues by capitalizing on increased volumes that may result from carrier network upgrades promoting site development services expanding the scope of our services and focusing on customer service and deployment speed we have the capability and expertise to install with the assistance of our network of subcontractors equipment or antenna systems for our customers we do not always provide the installation services or site development services for our customers on our communications infrastructure as third parties also provide these services see also —competition below these activities are typically nonrecurring and highly competitive with a number of local competitors in most markets typically our installation services are billed on a costplus profit basis and site development services are billed on a fixed fee basis 

customers  our towers customers are primarily comprised of large wireless carriers that operate national networks 

our fiber customers are generally large wireless carriers and organizations with highbandwidth and multilocation demands such as enterprise government education healthcare and wholesale customers 

 5 

our four largest customers are att tmobile verizon wireless and sprint collectively these four customers accounted for 83  of our 2017  site rental revenues also see item 1a risk factors  and note 16  to our consolidated financial statements for 2017  our site rental revenues by customer were as follows 

sales and marketing  our sales organization markets our towers small cells and fiber with the objective of contracting access with customers to existing communications infrastructure or to new communications infrastructure prior to construction we seek to become the critical partner and preferred independent communications infrastructure provider for our customers and increase customer satisfaction relative to our peers by leveraging our 1 existing unique communications infrastructure footprint 2 customer relationships 3 processcentric approach 4 technological tools and 5 construction capabilities and expertise 

our sales team is organized based on a variety of factors including customer type such as wireless carriers and organizations and geography a team of national account directors maintains our relationships with our largest customers these directors work to develop communications infrastructure contracts as well as to ensure that customers communications infrastructure needs are efficiently translated into new contracts on our communications infrastructure sales personnel in our local offices develop and maintain relationships with our customers that are expanding their networks entering new markets seeking new or additional communication infrastructure offerings bringing new technologies to market or requiring maintenance or addon business in addition to our fulltime sales or marketing staff a number of seniorlevel employees spend a significant portion of their time on sales and marketing activities and call on existing or prospective customers 

competition  we face competition for site rental tenants from various sources including 1 other independent communications infrastructure owners or operators including competitors that own operate or manage towers rooftops broadcast towers utility poles fiber including nontraditional competitors such as cable providers or small cells or 2 new alternative deployment methods for communications infrastructure 

some of the larger companies with which we compete for towers segment business opportunities include american tower corporation and sba communications corporation our fiber segment business competitors can vary significantly based on geography some of the larger companies with which we compete for fiber segment business opportunities include other owners of fiber as well as new entrants into small cells and fiber solutions we believe that location existing communications infrastructure footprint deployment speed quality of service expertise reputation capacity and price have been and will continue to be the most significant competitive factors affecting our businesses see item 1a risk factors 

competitors to our network services offering include site acquisition consultants zoning consultants real estate firms rightofway consulting firms construction companies tower owners or managers radio frequency engineering consultants telecommunications equipment vendors who can provide turnkey site development services through multiple subcontractors or our customers internal staff we believe that our customers base their decisions on the outsourcing of network services on criteria such as a companys experience record of accomplishment reputation price and time for completion of a project 

employees 

at january 31 2018  we employed approximately 4500 people we are not a party to any collective bargaining agreements we have not experienced any strikes or work stoppages and management believes that our employee relations are satisfactory

regulatory and environmental matters 

we are required to comply with a variety of federal state and local regulations and laws in the us including fcc and federal aviation administration faa regulations and those discussed under —environmental  below to date we have not incurred any material fines or penalties or experienced any material adverse effects to our business as a result of any domestic or international regulations the summary below is based on regulations currently in effect and such regulations are subject to review or modification by the applicable governmental authority from time to time if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations we may be fined or even lose our rights to conduct some of our business 

federal regulations  both the fcc and the faa regulate towers used for wireless communications radio or television broadcasting such regulations control the siting lighting or marking of towers and may depending on the characteristics of particular towers require the registration of tower facilities with the fcc and the issuance of determinations confirming no hazard to air traffic wireless communications devices operating on towers are separately regulated and independently licensed based upon the particular frequency used in addition the fcc and the faa have developed standards to consider proposals for new or modified tower or antenna structures based upon the height or location including proximity to airports proposals to construct or to modify existing tower or antenna structures above certain heights are reviewed by the faa to ensure the structure will not present a hazard to aviation which determination may be conditioned upon compliance with lighting or marking requirements the fcc requires its licensees to operate communications devices only on towers that comply with faa rules and are registered with the fcc if required by its regulations where tower lighting is required by faa regulation tower owners bear the responsibility of notifying the faa of any tower lighting outage and ensuring the timely restoration of such outages failure to comply with the applicable requirements may lead to civil penalties 

local regulations  the us telecommunications act of 1996 amended the communications act of 1934 to preserve state and local zoning authorities jurisdiction over the siting of communications towers and small cells the law however limits local zoning authority by prohibiting actions by local authorities that discriminate between different service providers of wireless communications or ban altogether the provision of wireless communications additionally the law prohibits state and local restrictions based on the environmental effects of radio frequency emissions to the extent the facilities comply with fcc regulations 

local regulations include city and other local ordinances including subdivision and zoning ordinances approvals for construction modification and removal of towers and small cells and restrictive covenants imposed by community developers these regulations vary greatly but typically require us to obtain approval from local officials prior to tower construction local zoning authorities may render decisions that prevent the construction or modification of towers or place conditions on such construction or modifications that are responsive to community residents concerns regarding the height visibility or other characteristics of the towers over the last several years there have been several developments related to fcc regulations and legislation that assist in expediting and streamlining the deployment of wireless networks including establishing timeframes for reviews by local and state governments notwithstanding such legislative and fcc actions decisions of local zoning authorities may also adversely affect the timing or cost of communications infrastructure construction or modification 

certain of our fiber related subsidiaries hold authorizations to provide intrastate telecommunication services as competitive local exchange carriers clec in numerous states and to provide domestic interstate telecommunication services as authorized by the fcc these fiber subsidiaries are primarily regulated by state public service commissions clec status in certain cases helps promote access to public rightsofway which is beneficial to the deployment of our small cells on a timely basis status as a clec often allows us to deploy our small cells in locations where zoning restrictions might otherwise delay restrict or prevent building or expanding traditional wireless tower sites or traditional wireless rooftop sites see item 1a risk factors 

environmental we are required to comply with a variety of federal state and local environmental laws and regulations protecting environmental quality including air and water quality and wildlife protection to date we have not incurred any material fines or penalties or experienced any material adverse effects to our business as a result of any domestic or international environmental regulations or matters see item 1a risk factors 

the construction of new towers and small cells or in some cases the modification of existing towers in the us may be subject to environmental review under the national environmental policy act of 1969 as amended nepa which requires federal agencies to evaluate the environmental impact of major federal actions the fcc has promulgated regulations implementing nepa which require applicants to investigate the potential environmental impact of the proposed tower or small cells construction should the proposed tower or small cells construction present a significant environmental impact the fcc must prepare an environmental impact statement subject to public comment if the proposed construction or modification of a tower may have a significant impact on the environment the fccs approval of the construction or modification could be significantly delayed 

our operations are subject to federal state and local laws and regulations relating to the management use storage disposal emission or remediation of or exposure to hazardous or nonhazardous substances materials or wastes as an owner lessee or operator of real property we are subject to certain environmental laws that impose strict jointandseveral liability for the 

 7 

cleanup of onsite or offsite contamination relating to existing or historical operations or we could also be subject to personal injury or property damage claims relating to such contamination in general our customer contracts prohibit our customers from using or storing any hazardous substances on our communications infrastructure sites in violation of applicable environmental laws and require our customers to provide notice of certain environmental conditions caused by them 

as licensees and communications infrastructure owners we are also subject to regulations and guidelines that impose a variety of operational requirements relating to radio frequency emissions as employers we are subject to occupational safety and health administration and similar guidelines regarding employee protection from radio frequency exposure the potential connection between radio frequency emissions and certain negative health effects including some forms of cancer has been the subject of substantial study by the scientific community in recent years 

we have compliance programs and monitoring projects to help assure that we are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations nevertheless there can be no assurance that the costs of compliance with existing or future environmental laws will not have a material adverse effect on us 

other regulations  we hold through certain of our subsidiaries licenses for common carrier microwave service which are subject to additional regulation by the fcc we also hold a nationwide fcc license relating to the 16701675 mhz spectrum 16701675 spectrum which we have leased to a third party through 2023 subject to the lessees option to purchase the 16701675 spectrum

 item 1a risk factors 

you should carefully consider all of the risks described below as well as the other information contained in this document when evaluating your investment in our securities 

risks relating to our business 

our business depends on the demand for our communications infrastructure driven primarily by demand for data and we may be adversely affected by any slowdown in such demand additionally a reduction in the amount or change in the mix of network investment by our customers may materially and adversely affect our business including reducing demand for tenant additions or network services 

customer demand for our communications infrastructure depends on the demand for data the willingness of our customers to utilize our communications infrastructure or renew or extend existing contracts on our communications infrastructure is affected by numerous factors including 

 a slowdown in demand for data or our communications infrastructure may negatively impact our growth or otherwise have a material adverse effect on us if our customers or potential customers are unable to raise adequate capital to fund their business plans as a result of disruptions in the financial and credit markets or otherwise they may reduce their spending which could adversely affect our anticipated growth or the demand for our communications infrastructure or network services 

the amount timing and mix of our customers network investment is variable and can be significantly impacted by the various matters described in these risk factors changes in customer network investment typically impact the demand for our communications infrastructure as a result changes in customer plans such as delays in the implementation of new systems new and emerging technologies including small cells and fiber solutions or plans to expand coverage or capacity may reduce demand for our communications infrastructure furthermore the industries in which our customers operate particularly those in the wireless industry could experience a slowdown or slowing growth rates as a result of numerous factors including a reduction in consumer demand including demand for wireless connectivity or general economic conditions there can be no assurances that weakness or uncertainty in the economic environment will not adversely impact our customers or their industries which may materially and adversely affect our business including by reducing demand for our communications infrastructure or network services in addition a slowdown may increase competition for site rental customers or network services such an industry slowdown or a reduction in customer network investment may materially and adversely affect our business 

 9 

a substantial portion of our revenues is derived from a small number of customers and the loss consolidation or financial instability of any of such customers may materially decrease revenues or reduce demand for our communications infrastructure and network services 

our four largest customers are att tmobile verizon wireless and sprint collectively these four customers accounted for 83  of our 2017  site rental revenues the loss of any one of our large customers as a result of consolidation merger bankruptcy insolvency network sharing roaming joint development resale agreements by our customers or otherwise may result in 1 a material decrease in our revenues 2 uncollectible account receivables 3 an impairment of our deferred site rental receivables communications infrastructure assets intangible assets or 4 other adverse effects to our business we cannot guarantee that contracts with our major customers will not be terminated or that these customers will renew their contracts with us in addition to our four largest customers we also derive a portion of our revenues and anticipated future growth from 1 fiber solutions customers and 2 new entrants offering or contemplating offering wireless services such customers including those dependent on government funding may be smaller or have less financial resources than our four largest customers may have business models which may not be successful or may require additional capital see also item 1 business—the company  and note 16  to our consolidated financial statements 

consolidation among our customers will likely result in duplicate or overlapping parts of networks for example where they are coresidents on a tower which may result in the termination or nonrenewal of tenant contracts and negatively impact revenues from our communications infrastructure due to the longterm nature of tenant contracts we expect that any termination of tenant contracts as a result of this potential consolidation would be spread over multiple years such consolidation may result in a reduction in such customers future network investment in the aggregate because their expansion plans may be similar customer consolidation could decrease the demand for our communications infrastructure which in turn may result in a reduction in our revenues or cash flows 

see note 15  to our consolidated financial statements 

the expansion or development of our business including through acquisitions increased product offerings or other strategic growth opportunities may cause disruptions in our business which may have an adverse effect on our business operations or financial results additionally we may fail to realize all of the anticipated benefits of the lightower acquisition or those benefits may take longer to realize than expected 

we seek to expand and develop our business including through acquisitions increased product offerings such as small cells and fiber solutions or other strategic growth opportunities in the ordinary course of our business we review analyze and evaluate various potential transactions or other activities in which we may engage such transactions or activities could cause disruptions in increase risk or otherwise negatively impact our business among other things such transactions and activities may 

 with respect to our recent lightower acquisition see note 4 to our consolidated financial statements we may encounter significant difficulties in integrating lightowers business our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the lightower acquisition will depend to a large extent on our ability to integrate the lightower business into ours the integration of an independent business into our business is a complex costly and timeconsuming process as a result we will be required to devote significant management attention and resources to integrate lightowers business practices and operations with ours including a larger fiber solutions business than we currently manage the integration process may disrupt the businesses and if implemented ineffectively would reduce the realization of the full expected benefits the failure to meet the challenges involved in integrating lightowers business and to realize the anticipated benefits of the transaction could cause an interruption of or a loss of momentum in the activities of our company and could adversely affect our results of operations in addition we could encounter additional 

 10 

transactionrelated costs or other factors which could delay our realization of the expected benefits of the lightower acquisition and negatively impact our business 

our fiber segment has expanded rapidly and the fiber business model contains certain differences from our towers business model resulting in different operational risks if we do not successfully operate our fiber business model or identify or manage the related operational risks such operations may produce results that are less than anticipated 

in recent years we have allocated a significant amount of capital to our fiber business which is a much less mature business for us than our towers business which we have operated since 1994 our fiber segment represented 21  and 12 of our site rental revenues for the years ended december 31 2017 and 2016 respectively the business model for our fiber operations contains certain differences from our business model for our towers operations including certain differences relating to customer base competition contract terms including requirements for service level agreements regarding network performance and maintenance upfront capital requirements landlord demographics ownership of certain network assets operational oversight requirements government regulations growth rates and applicable laws 

while our fiber operations have certain risks that are similar to our towers operations they also have certain operational risks that are different from our towers business including 

 in addition the rate at which customers adopt or prioritize small cells and fiber solutions may be lower or slower than we anticipate or may cease to exist altogether our fiber operations will also expose us to different safety or liability risks or hazards than our towers business as a result of numerous factors including the location or nature of the assets involved there may be risks and challenges associated with small cells and fiber solutions being comparatively new and emerging technologies and continuing to evolve and there may be other risks related to small cells and fiber solutions of which we are not yet aware 

failure to timely and efficiently execute on our construction projects could adversely affect our business 

our construction projects some of which are longterm and complex in nature can be challenging to execute the quality of our performance on such construction projects depends in large part upon our ability to manage 1 the associated customer relationship and 2 the project itself by timely deploying and properly managing appropriate internal and external project resources in connection with our construction projects we generally bear the risk of cost overruns labor availability and productivity and contractor pricing and performance additionally contracts with our customers for these projects typically specify delivery dates performance criteria and penalties for our failure to perform our failure to manage such customer relationships project resources and project milestones in a timely and efficient manner could have a material adverse effect on our business 

our substantial level of indebtedness could adversely affect our ability to react to changes in our business and the terms of our debt instruments and our 6875 convertible preferred stock limit our ability to take a number of actions that our management might otherwise believe to be in our best interests in addition if we fail to comply with our covenants our debt could be accelerated 

we have a substantial amount of indebtedness approximately 162 billion as of february 21 2018  see item 7 mda—liquidity and capital resources  for a tabular presentation of our contractual debt maturities as a result of our substantial indebtedness 



 11 

 currently we have debt instruments in place that limit in certain circumstances our ability to incur additional indebtedness pay dividends create liens sell assets or engage in certain mergers and acquisitions among other things in addition the credit agreement governing our senior unsecured credit facility 2016 credit facility contains financial maintenance covenants our ability to comply with these covenants or to satisfy our debt obligations will depend on our future operating performance if we violate the restrictions in our debt instruments or fail to comply with our financial maintenance covenants we will be in default under those instruments which in some cases would cause the maturity of a substantial portion of our longterm indebtedness to be accelerated furthermore if the limits on our ability to pay dividends prevent us from satisfying our reit distribution requirements we could fail to remain qualified for taxation as a reit if these limits do not jeopardize our qualification for taxation as a reit but nevertheless prevent us from distributing 100 of our reit taxable income we will be subject to federal and state corporate income taxes and potentially a nondeductible excise tax on our undistributed taxable income if our operating subsidiaries were to default on their debt the trustee could seek to foreclose the collateral securing such debt in which case we could lose the communications infrastructure and the revenues associated with such communications infrastructure see item 7 mda—liquidity and capital resources—debt covenants  for a further discussion of our debt covenants 

ccic is a holding company that conducts all of its operations through its subsidiaries accordingly ccics sources of cash to pay interest or principal on its outstanding indebtedness are distributions relating to its respective ownership interests in its subsidiaries from the net earnings and cash flows generated by such subsidiaries or from proceeds of debt or equity offerings earnings and cash flows generated by ccics subsidiaries are first applied by such subsidiaries to conduct their operations including servicing their respective debt obligations after which any excess cash flows generally may be paid to such holding company in the absence of any special conditions such as a continuing event of default however ccics subsidiaries are legally distinct from the holding company and unless they guarantee such debt have no obligation to pay amounts due on their debt or to make funds available to us for such payment 

if we fail to pay scheduled dividends on our 6875 convertible preferred stock in cash common stock or any combination of cash and common stock we will be prohibited from paying dividends on our common stock which may jeopardize our status as a reit 

we have a substantial amount of indebtedness in the event we do not repay or refinance such indebtedness we could face substantial liquidity issues and might be required to issue equity securities or securities convertible into equity securities or sell some of our assets to meet our debt payment obligations 

we have a substantial amount of indebtedness which upon final maturity we will need to refinance or repay see item 7 mda—liquidity and capital resources  for a tabular presentation of our contractual debt maturities there can be no assurances we will be able to refinance our indebtedness 1 on commercially reasonable terms 2 on terms including with respect to interest rates as favorable as our current debt or 3 at all 

economic conditions and the credit markets have historically experienced and may continue to experience periods of volatility uncertainty or weakness that could impact the availability or cost of debt financing including any refinancing of the obligations described above or on our ability to draw the full amount of our 35 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility under our 2016 credit facility 2016 revolver that as of february 21 2018  has 30 billion  of undrawn availability 

if we are unable to repay or refinance our debt we cannot guarantee that we will be able to generate enough cash flows from operations or that we will be able to obtain enough capital to service our debt fund our planned capital expenditures or pay future dividends in such an event we could face substantial liquidity issues and might be required to issue equity securities or securities convertible into equity securities or sell some of our assets to meet our debt payment obligations failure to repay or refinance 

 12 

indebtedness when required could result in a default under such indebtedness if we incur additional indebtedness any such indebtedness could exacerbate the risks described above 

sales or issuances of a substantial number of shares of our common stock or securities convertible into shares of our common stock may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

future sales or issuances of common stock or other equity related securities may adversely affect the market price of our common stock including any shares of our common stock issued to finance capital expenditures finance acquisitions or repay debt our business strategy contemplates access to external financing to fund certain discretionary investments which may include issuances of common stock or other equity related securities we maintain an atthemarket stock offering program atm program through which we may from time to time issue and sell shares of our common stock having an aggregate gross sales price of up to 5000 million to or through sales agents as of february 21 2018  we had approximately 150 million  of gross sales of common stock remaining under our atm program from time to time we may refresh or implement a new atthemarket stock offering program see note 12 to our consolidated financial statements as of february 21 2018  we had approximately 407  million shares of common stock outstanding 

we have reserved 112 million  and 172 million shares of common stock respectively for issuance in connection with awards granted under our various stock compensation plans and our 6875 convertible preferred stock which will automatically convert into common stock on august 1 2020 see item 7 mda—liquidity and capital resources—mandatory convertible preferred stock the dividends on our 6875 convertible preferred stock may also be paid in cash or subject to certain limitations shares of common stock or any combination of cash and shares of common stock 

further a small number of common stockholders own a significant percentage of our outstanding common stock if any one of these common stockholders or any group of our common stockholders sells a large quantity of shares of our common stock or the public market perceives that existing common stockholders might sell a large quantity of shares of our common stock the market price of our common stock may significantly decline 

as a result of competition in our industry we may find it more difficult to negotiate favorable rates on our new or renewing tenant contracts 

our growth is dependent on our entering into new tenant contracts including amendments to contracts upon modification of an existing tower fiber or small cell installation as well as renewing or renegotiating tenant contracts when existing tenant contracts terminate competition in our industry may make it more difficult for us to attract new customers maintain or increase our gross margins or maintain or increase our market share we face competition for site rental tenants and associated contractual rates from various sources including 1 other independent communications infrastructure owners or operators including those that own operate or manage towers rooftops broadcast towers utility poles fiber including nontraditional competitors such as cable providers or small cells or 2 new alternative deployment methods for communications infrastructure 

our fiber operations may have different competitors than our towers business including other owners of fiber as well as new entrants into small cells and fiber solutions some of which may have larger networks or greater financial resources than we have 

new technologies may reduce demand for our communications infrastructure or negatively impact our revenues 

improvements in the efficiency architecture and design of wireless networks may reduce the demand for our communications infrastructure for example new technologies that may promote network sharing joint development wireless backhaul or resale agreements by our customers such as signal combining technologies or network functions virtualization may reduce the need for our communications infrastructure in addition other technologies such as wifi distributed antenna systems das femtocells other small cells or satellite such as low earth orbiting and mesh transmission systems may in the future serve as substitutes for or alternatives to leasing on communications infrastructure that might otherwise be anticipated or expected had such technologies not existed in addition new technologies that enhance the range efficiency and capacity of wireless equipment could reduce demand for our communications infrastructure any significant reduction in demand for our communications infrastructure resulting from the new technologies may negatively impact our revenues or otherwise have a material adverse effect on us 

if we fail to retain rights to our communications infrastructure including the land interests under our towers and the rightofway and other agreements related to our small cells and fiber solutions our business may be adversely affected 

the property interests on which our communications infrastructure resides including the land interests under our towers consist of leasehold and subleasehold interests fee interests easements licenses and rightsofway a loss of these interests may interfere with our ability to conduct our business or generate revenues for various reasons we may not always have the ability 

 13 

to access analyze or verify all information regarding titles or other issues prior to acquiring communications infrastructure further we may not be able to renew ground leases on commercially viable terms our ability to retain rights to the land interests on which our towers reside depends on our ability to purchase such land including fee interests and perpetual easements or renegotiate or extend the terms of the leases relating to such land approximately 10  of our towers site rental gross margin for the year ended december 31 2017  was derived from towers where the leases for the interests under such towers had final expiration dates of less than ten years if we are unable to retain rights to the property interests on which our communications infrastructure resides our business may be adversely affected 

as of december 31 2017  approximately 53  of our towers were leased or subleased or operated and managed under master leases subleases or other agreements with att sprint and tmobile we have the option to purchase these towers at the end of their respective lease terms we have no obligation to exercise such purchase options we may not have the required available capital to exercise our right to purchase some or all of these towers at the time these options are exercisable even if we do have available capital we may choose not to exercise our right to purchase these towers or some or all of the tmobile or att towers for business or other reasons in the event that we do not exercise these purchase rights or are otherwise unable to acquire an interest that would allow us to continue to operate these towers after the applicable period we will lose the cash flows derived from such towers which may have a material adverse effect on our business in the event that we decide to exercise these purchase rights the benefits of the acquisition of these towers may not exceed the costs which could adversely affect our business additional information concerning these towers and the applicable purchase options as of december 31 2017  is as follows 

 under master lease or master prepaid lease arrangements we have with att sprint and tmobile certain of our subsidiaries lease or sublease or are otherwise granted the right to manage and operate towers from bankruptcy remote subsidiaries of such carriers if one of these bankruptcy remote subsidiaries should become a debtor in a bankruptcy proceeding and is permitted to reject the underlying ground lease our subsidiaries could lose their interest in the applicable sites if our subsidiaries were to lose their interest in the applicable sites or if the applicable ground leases were to be terminated we would lose the cash flow derived from the towers on those sites which may have a material adverse effect on our business we have similar bankruptcy risks with respect to sites that we operate under management agreements 

for our small cells and fiber solutions we must maintain rightsofway franchise pole attachment conduit use and other agreements to operate our assets for various reasons we may not always have the ability to maintain these agreements or obtain future agreements to construct maintain and operate our fiber assets access to rightsofway depends in large part on our clec status and we cannot be certain that jurisdictions will 1 recognize such clec status or 2 not change their laws concerning clec access to rightsofway if a material portion of these agreements are terminated or are not renewed we might be forced to abandon our assets which may adversely impact our business in order to operate our assets we must also maintain fiber agreements that we have with public and private entities there is no assurance that we will be able to renew those agreements on favorable terms or at all if we are unable to renew those agreements on favorable terms we may face increased costs or reduced revenues 

 14 

additionally in order to expand our communications infrastructure footprint to new locations we often need to obtain new or additional rightsofway and other agreements our failure to obtain these agreements in a prompt and costeffective manner may prevent us from expanding our footprint which may be necessary to meet our contractual obligations to our customers and could adversely impact our business 

our network services business has historically experienced significant volatility in demand which reduces the predictability of our results 

the operating results of our network services business for any particular period may vary significantly and should not necessarily be considered indicative of longerterm results for this activity our network services business is generally driven by demand for our communications infrastructure and may be adversely impacted by various factors including 

 new wireless technologies may not deploy or be adopted by customers as rapidly or in the manner projected 

there can be no assurances that new wireless services or technologies will be introduced or deployed as rapidly or in the manner projected by the wireless carriers in addition demand or customer adoption rates for such new technologies may be lower or slower than anticipated for numerous reasons as a result growth opportunities or demand for our communications infrastructure arising from such technologies may not be realized at the times or to the extent anticipated 

if we fail to comply with laws or regulations which regulate our business and which may change at any time we may be fined or even lose our right to conduct some of our business 

a variety of federal state local and foreign laws and regulations apply to our business including those discussed in item 1 business   failure to comply with applicable requirements may lead to civil or criminal penalties require us to assume indemnification obligations or breach contractual provisions we cannot guarantee that existing or future laws or regulations including federal state or local tax laws will not adversely affect our business including our reit status increase delays or result in additional costs we also may incur additional costs as a result of liabilities under applicable laws and regulations such as those governing environmental and safety matters these factors may have a material adverse effect on us 

if radio frequency emissions from wireless handsets or equipment on our communications infrastructure are demonstrated to cause negative health effects potential future claims could adversely affect our operations costs or revenues 

the potential connection between radio frequency emissions and certain negative health effects including some forms of cancer has been the subject of substantial study by the scientific community in recent years we cannot guarantee that claims relating to radio frequency emissions will not arise in the future or that the results of such studies will not be adverse to us 

public perception of possible health risks associated with cellular or other wireless connectivity services may slow or diminish the growth of wireless companies which may in turn slow or diminish our growth in particular negative public perception of and regulations regarding these perceived health risks may slow or diminish the market acceptance of wireless services if a connection between radio frequency emissions and possible negative health effects were established our operations costs or revenues may be materially and adversely affected we currently do not maintain any significant insurance with respect to these matters 

certain provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation charter amended and restated bylaws bylaws and operative agreements and domestic and international competition laws may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us or for us to acquire control of a third party even if such a change in control would be beneficial to our stockholders 

we have a number of antitakeover devices in place that will hinder takeover attempts or may reduce the market value of our common stock our antitakeover provisions include 



 15 

our bylaws permit special meetings of the stockholders to be called only upon the request of our chief executive officer or a majority of the board of directors and deny stockholders the ability to call such meetings such provisions as well as the provisions of section 203 of the delaware general corporation law may impede a merger consolidation takeover or other business combination or discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us 

in addition domestic or international competition laws may prevent or discourage us from acquiring communications infrastructure in certain geographical areas or impede a merger consolidation takeover or other business combination or discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us 

we may be vulnerable to security breaches that could adversely affect our operations business and reputation 

despite existing security measures certain of our communications infrastructure may be vulnerable to damage disruptions or shutdowns due to unauthorized access computer viruses cyberattacks and other security breaches an attack attempt or security breach such as a distributed denial of service attack could potentially result in 1 interruption or cessation of certain of our services to our customers 2 our inability to meet expected levels of service to our customers or 3 data transmitted over our customers networks being compromised we cannot guarantee that our security measures will not be circumvented resulting in customer network failures or interruptions that could impact our customers network availability and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or operational results we may be required to expend significant resources to protect against or recover from such threats we maintain an insurance policy that includes coverage over cyberattacks and other security breaches however there can be no assurances that such coverage will be adequate to cover exposure for such incidents if an actual or perceived breach of our security occurs the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed and we could lose customers further the perpetrators of cyberattacks are not restricted to particular groups or persons these attacks may be committed by our employees or external actors operating in any geography in addition our recent acquisitions including the 2017 acquisitions may alter our potential exposure to the risks described above we are currently evaluating such risks with respect to these acquisitions any such events could result in legal claims or penalties disruption in operations misappropriation of sensitive data damage to our reputation negative market perception or costly response measures which could adversely affect our business 

risks relating to our reit status 

future dividend payments to our stockholders will reduce the availability of our cash on hand available to fund future discretionary investments and may result in a need to incur indebtedness or issue equity securities to fund growth opportunities in such event the then current economic credit market or equity market conditions will impact the availability or cost of such financing which may hinder our ability to grow our per share results of operations 

during each of the first three quarters of 2017  we paid a quarterly common stock dividend of 095 per share totaling approximately 11 billion in october 2017  we increased our quarterly dividend beginning in the fourth quarter of 2017  from an annual amount of 380 per share to an annual amount of 420 per share as such we declared a quarterly dividend of 105 per share in october 2017  which represented an increase of 11 from the quarterly dividend declared during each of the first three quarters of 2017  we currently expect such dividends to result in aggregate annual cash payments of at least 17 billion during the next 12 months over time we expect to increase our dividend per share generally commensurate with our realized growth in cash flows any future dividends are subject to the approval of our board of directors see notes 12  and 19  to our consolidated financial statements 

we operate as a reit for us federal income tax purposes to remain qualified and be taxed as a reit we will generally be required to annually distribute at least 90 of our reit taxable income determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction excluding net capital gain and after the utilization of any available nols to our stockholders our quarterly cash common stock dividend will delay the utilization of our nols and may cause certain of the nols to expire without utilization see also item 7 mda—general overview—common stock dividend  and item 1 business—company developments reit status and industry update—reit status 

as discussed in item 1 mda—business—strategy  we seek to invest our capital including the net cash provided by our operating activities as well as external financing sources in a manner that we believe will increase longterm stockholder value on a riskadjusted basis our historical discretionary investments have included the following in no particular order acquiring or constructing communications infrastructure acquiring land interests under towers improving or structurally enhancing our existing communications infrastructure purchasing our common stock or purchasing repaying or redeeming our debt external financing including debt equity and equityrelated issuances to fund future discretionary investments either 1 may not be available to us or 2 may not be accessible by us at terms that would result in the investment of the net proceeds raised yielding incremental growth in our per share operating results as a result future dividend payments may hinder our ability to grow our per share results of operations or otherwise adversely affect our ability to execute our business plan 

 16 

remaining qualified to be taxed as a reit involves highly technical and complex provisions of the code failure to remain qualified as a reit would result in our inability to deduct dividends to stockholders when computing our taxable income which would reduce our available cash 

we operate as a reit for us federal tax purposes as a reit we are generally entitled to a deduction for dividends that we pay and therefore are not subject to us federal corporate income tax on our net taxable income that is currently distributed to our common stockholders 

while we intend to operate so that we remain qualified as a reit given the highly complex nature of the rules governing reits the importance of ongoing factual determinations the possibility of future changes in our circumstances and the potential impact of future changes to laws and regulations impacting reits no assurance can be given that we will qualify as a reit for any particular year 

we do not expect the recentlyenacted legislation commonly referred to as the tax reform act to significantly affect us although we cannot predict with certainty how such legislation will affect us in the future in addition the present us federal tax treatment of reits is subject to change possibly with retroactive effect by legislative judicial or administrative action at any time and any such change might adversely affect our reit status or benefits we cannot predict the impact if any that such changes if enacted might have on our business however it is possible that such changes could adversely affect our business including our reit status 

if in any taxable year we fail to qualify for taxation as a reit and are not entitled to relief under certain provisions of the the code then 

 although we may have federal nols available to reduce any taxable income to the extent our federal nols have been utilized or are otherwise unavailable any such corporate tax liability could be substantial would reduce the amount of cash available for other purposes and might necessitate the borrowing of additional funds or the liquidation of some investments to pay any additional tax liability accordingly funds available for investment would be reduced 

under the code for taxable years beginning before 2018 no more than 25 of the value of the assets of a reit may be represented by securities of one or more trss for taxable years beginning in or after 2018 no more than 20 of the value of the assets of a reit may be represented by securities of one or more trss these current or future limitations may affect our ability to make additional investments in nonreit qualifying operations or assets or in any operations held through trss the net income of our trss is not required to be distributed to us and income that is not distributed to us generally will not be subject to the reit income distribution requirement however there may be limitations on our ability to accumulate earnings in our trss and the accumulation or reinvestment of significant earnings in our trss could result in adverse tax treatment in particular if the accumulation of cash in our trss causes the fair market value of our securities in our trss to exceed current or future limitations of the fair market value of our assets at the end of any quarter then we may fail to remain qualified as a reit 

if we fail to pay scheduled dividends on our 6875 convertible preferred stock in cash common stock or any combination of cash and common stock we will be prohibited from paying dividends on our common stock which may jeopardize our status as a reit 

the terms of the 6875 convertible preferred stock provide that unless accumulated dividends have been paid or set aside for payment on all outstanding 6875 convertible preferred stock for all past dividend periods no dividends may be declared or paid on our common stock if that were to occur the inability to pay dividends on our common stock might jeopardize our status as a reit for us federal income tax purposes see note 12 to our consolidated financial statements

complying with reit requirements including the 90 distribution requirement may limit our flexibility or cause us to forgo otherwise attractive opportunities including certain discretionary investments and potential financing alternatives 

to remain qualified and be taxed as a reit we are required to satisfy the 90 distribution requirement as described above we commenced declaring regular quarterly dividends to our common stockholders beginning with the first quarter of 2014 see notes 12  and 19  to our consolidated financial statements any such dividends however are subject to the determination and approval of our board of directors based on thencurrent and anticipated future conditions including our earnings net cash provided by operating activities capital requirements financial condition our relative market capitalization our existing federal nols of approximately 15 billion  or other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors 

to the extent that we satisfy the 90 distribution requirement but distribute less than 100 of our reit taxable income determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction excluding net capital gain and after the utilization of any available nols we will be subject to federal corporate income tax on our undistributed taxable income in addition we will be subject to a 4 nondeductible excise tax if the actual amount that we pay out to our stockholders for a calendar year is less than a minimum amount specified under the code 

from time to time we may generate reit taxable income greater than our cash flow as a result of differences in timing between the recognition of taxable income and the actual receipt of cash or the effect of nondeductible capital expenditures the creation of reserves or required debt or amortization payments if we do not have other funds available in these situations we could be required to borrow funds on unfavorable terms sell assets at disadvantageous prices or distribute amounts that would otherwise be invested in future acquisitions to make distributions sufficient to enable us to pay out enough of our taxable income to satisfy the reit dividend requirement and to avoid corporate income tax and the 4 excise tax in a particular year these alternatives could increase our costs or reduce our equity thus compliance with the reit requirements may hinder our ability to grow which could adversely affect the value of our common stock furthermore the reit dividend requirements may increase the financing we need to fund capital expenditures future growth or expansion initiatives which would increase our total leverage 

in addition to satisfying the 90 distribution requirement to remain qualified as a reit for tax purposes we will need to continually satisfy tests concerning among other things the sources of our income the nature and diversification of our assets and the ownership of our capital stock compliance with these tests will require us to refrain from certain activities and may hinder our ability to make certain attractive investments including the purchase of nonqualifying assets the expansion of nonreal estate activities or investments in the businesses to be conducted by our trss and to that extent limit our opportunities and our flexibility to change our business strategy furthermore acquisition opportunities in domestic or international markets may be adversely affected if we need or require the target company to comply with some reit requirements prior to completing any such acquisition in addition our conversion to a reit may result in investor pressures not to pursue growth opportunities that are not immediately accretive 

moreover if we fail to comply with certain asset ownership tests at the end of any calendar quarter we must correct the failure within 30 days after the end of the calendar quarter or qualify for certain statutory relief provisions to avoid losing our reit qualification as a result we may be required to liquidate assets in adverse market conditions or forgo otherwise attractive investments these actions may reduce our income and amounts available for distribution to our stockholders 

reit related ownership limitations and transfer restrictions may prevent or restrict certain transfers of our capital stock 

in order for us to continue to satisfy the requirements for reit qualification our capital stock must be beneficially owned by 100 or more persons during at least 335 days of a taxable year of 12 months or during a proportionate part of a shorter taxable year also not more than 50 of the value of the outstanding shares of our capital stock may be owned directly or indirectly by five or fewer individuals as defined in the code to include certain entities such as private foundations during the last half of a taxable year in order to facilitate compliance with the reit rules our charter includes provisions that implement reitrelated ownership limitations and transfer restrictions that generally prohibit any person as defined in our charter from beneficially or constructively owning or being deemed to beneficially or constructively own by virtue of the attribution provisions of the code more than 98 by value or number of shares whichever is more restrictive of the outstanding shares of our common stock or 98 in aggregate value of the outstanding shares of all classes and series of our capital stock including our common stock and any shares of our 6875 convertible preferred stock in addition our charter provides for certain other ownership limitations and transfer restrictions under applicable constructive ownership rules any shares of capital stock owned by certain affiliated owners generally would be added together for purposes of the ownership limitations these ownership limitations and transfer restrictions could have the effect of delaying deferring or preventing a transaction or a change in control of our company that might involve a premium price for our capital stock or otherwise might be in the best interest of our stockholders

liquidity and capital resources 

overview 

general  our core business generates revenues under longterm contracts see item 1 business—overview and item 7 mda—general overview—overview  from the largest us wireless carriers and fiber solutions customers our strategy is to create longterm stockholder value via a combination of 1 growing cash flows generated from our portfolio of communications infrastructure 2 returning a meaningful portion of our cash provided by operating activities to our stockholders in the form of dividends and 3 investing capital efficiently to grow cash flows and longterm dividends per share we measure our efforts to create longterm stockholder value by the combined payment of dividends to stockholders and growth in our per share results see item 1 business—strategy  for a further discussion of our strategy 

we have engaged and expect to continue to engage in discretionary investments that we believe will maximize longterm stockholder value our historical discretionary investments include in no particular order acquiring or constructing communications infrastructure acquiring land interests under towers improving and structurally enhancing our existing communications infrastructure purchasing our common stock and purchasing repaying or redeeming our debt we have recently spent and expect to continue to spend a significant percentage of our discretionary investments on the construction of new small cells and fiber we seek to fund our discretionary investments with both net cash provided by operating activities and cash available 

 33 

from financing capacity such as the use of our undrawn availability from the 2016 revolver debt financings and issuances of equity or equity related securities including under our atm program 

we seek to maintain a capital structure that we believe drives longterm stockholder value and optimizes our weightedaverage cost of capital we target a leverage ratio of approximately four to five times adjusted ebitda and interest coverage of approximately three times adjusted ebitda subject to various factors such as the availability and cost of capital and the potential longterm return on our discretionary investments we may choose to increase or decrease our leverage or coverage from these targets for various periods of time

operating activities the increase in net cash provided by operating activities for 2017  from 2016  was due primarily to growth in our core business including a net benefit from changes in working capital the decrease in net cash provided by operating activities for 2016  from 2015  was due primarily to a net decrease in working capital partially offset by growth in our core business changes in working capital including changes in accounts receivable deferred site rental receivables deferred rental revenues prepaid ground leases restricted cash and accrued interest can have a significant impact on net cash provided by operating activities largely due to the timing of advanced payments by us and advanced receipts we expect to grow our net cash provided by operating activities in the future exclusive of movements in working capital if we realize expected growth in our core business 

investing activities historically our capital expenditures have been categorized as discretionary or sustaining as described below 

 we anticipate incurring initial capital expenditures related to integrating lightower into our existing business we anticipate that the majority of these expected capital expenditures will be incurred beginning in 2018 and will primarily relate to the integration of lightowers information technology assets into our business integration capital expenditures were 36 million and 01 million for the years ended december 31 2017 and 2016 respectively as such for periods presented prior to 2018 integration capital expenditures were included within sustaining capital expenditures for periods presented beginning january 1 2018 we will no longer reflect integration capital expenditures within sustaining capital expenditures and will consider integration capital expenditures as its own component of our capital expenditures 

we define integration capital expenditures as those capital expenditures made specifically with respect to recent acquisitions that are essential to integrating acquired companies into our business 

 35 

a summary of our capital expenditures for the last three years is as follows in thousands of dollars   

capital expenditures increased from 2016  to 2017  and were impacted by the construction of small cells and fiber including certain construction projects that may take 12 to 24 months to complete to address our customers growing demand for data partially offset by lower amounts of improvements to existing towers and lower sustaining capital expenditures in 2017 due to expansion of office facilities in 2016 our sustaining capital expenditures have historically been less than 2 of net revenues annually and were approximately 2 of net revenues in 2017  see item 7 mda—general overview—outlook highlights  for a discussion of our expectations surrounding 2018  capital expenditures

accounting and reporting matters 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the following is a discussion of the accounting policies and estimates that we believe 1 are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations or 2 require our most difficult subjective or complex judgments often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain the critical accounting policies and estimates for 2017  are not intended to be a comprehensive list of our accounting policies and estimates see note 2  to our consolidated financial statements for a summary of our significant accounting policies in many cases the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically prescribed by gaap in other cases management is required to exercise judgment in the application of accounting principles with respect to particular transactions 

revenue recognition   84  of our total revenue for 2017  consists of site rental revenues which are recognized on a monthly basis over the fixed noncancelable term of the relevant contract generally ranging from five to 15 years for site rental revenues derived from wireless customers and three to 20 years for site rental revenues derived from our fiber solutions business regardless of whether the payments from the tenant are received in equal monthly amounts if the payment terms call for fixed escalations as in fixed dollar or fixed percentage increases upfront payments or rent free periods the revenue is recognized on a straightline basis over the fixed noncancelable term of the contract when calculating our straightline rental revenues we consider all fixed elements of tenant contractual escalation provisions even if such escalation provisions contain a variable element such as an escalator tied to an inflationbased index in addition to a minimum to the extent we acquire belowmarket tenant leases for contractual interests with tenants on the acquired communications infrastructure for example with respect to small cells and fiber we record the fair value as deferred credits and amortize such deferred credits to site rental revenues over their estimated lease term since we recognize revenue on a straightline basis a portion of the site rental revenue in a given period represents cash collected or contractually collectible in other periods our assets related to straightline site rental revenues are included in other current assets and deferred site rental receivables amounts billed or received prior to being earned are deferred and reflected in deferred revenues and other longterm liabilities see notes 2  and 7  to our consolidated financial statements 

as part of our effort to provide comprehensive communications infrastructure solutions we also offer certain network services primarily relating to our towers and small cells which represent approximately 16  of our total revenues for 2017  network services and other revenue consists of 1 site development services and 2 installation services network services revenues are recognized after completion of the applicable service we account for network services separately from the customers site rental see item 1 business—the company  for a further discussion of our business 

accounting for acquisitions — general as described in  item 1 business  the majority of our communications infrastructure has been acquired directly or indirectly from the four largest wireless carriers or their predecessors through transactions consummated since 1999 we evaluate each of our acquisitions to determine if it should be accounted for as a business combination or as an acquisition of assets for our business combinations we allocate the purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair value at the date of acquisition any purchase price in excess of the net fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is allocated to goodwill see item 7 mda—accounting and reporting matters—accounting for acquisitions—valuation below and note 2 to our consolidated financial statements 

the determination of the final purchase price allocation could extend over several quarters resulting in the use of preliminary estimates that are subject to adjustment until finalized such changes could have a significant impact on our financial statements 

accounting for acquisitions — leases with respect to business combinations that include towers that we lease and operate such as the att tmobile and sprint leased and subleased towers we evaluate such agreements to determine treatment as capital or operating leases the evaluation of such agreements for capital or operating lease treatment includes consideration of each of the lease classification criteria under asc 8401025 namely 1 the transfer of ownership provisions 2 the existence of bargain purchase options 3 the length of the remaining lease term and 4 the present value of the minimum lease payments with respect to the att acquisition tmobile acquisition and the sprint towers acquired in the global signal acquisition we determined that the tower leases were capital leases and the underlying land leases were operating leases based upon the lease term criterion after considering the fragmentation criteria applicable under asc 8401025 to leases involving both land and buildings ie towers we determined that the fragmentation criteria was met and the tower leases could be accounted for as capital leases apart from the land leases which are accounted for as operating leases since 1 the fair value of the land in the aforementioned business combinations was greater than 25 of the total fair value of the leased property at inception and 2 the tower lease expirations occur beyond 75 of the estimated economic life of the tower assets 

 41 

accounting for acquisitions — valuation  as of december 31 2017  our largest asset was property and equipment which primarily consists of communications infrastructure followed by goodwill and intangible assets our identifiable intangible assets predominately relate to the site rental contracts and customer relationships intangible assets see note 2  to our consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the nature and composition of the site rental contracts and customer relationships intangible assets 

the fair value of the vast majority of our assets and liabilities is determined by using either 

 the purchase price allocation requires subjective estimates that if incorrectly estimated could be material to our consolidated financial statements including the amount of depreciation amortization and accretion expense the most important estimates for measurement of tangible fixed assets are 1 the cost to replace the asset with a new asset and 2 the economic useful life after giving effect to age quality and condition the most important estimates for measurement of intangible assets are 1 discount rates and 2 timing and amount of cash flows including estimates regarding customer renewals and cancellations the most important estimates for measurement of above and belowmarket leases is the determination of 1 favorability or unfavorability to the current market terms and 2 applicable lease term including whether renewals or extensions should be measured with respect to business combinations that include towers that we lease and operate such as the tmobile sprint and att leased and subleased towers we evaluate such agreements to determine treatment as capital or operating leases and identification of any bargain purchase options 

we record the fair value of obligations to perform certain asset retirement activities including requirements pursuant to our ground lease easements and leased facility agreements to remove communications infrastructure or remediate the space upon which our communications infrastructure resides in determining the fair value of these asset retirement obligations we must make several subjective and highly judgmental estimates such as those related to 1 timing of cash flows 2 future costs 3 discount rates and 4 the probability of enforcement to remove the towers or small cells or remediate the land see note 2  to our consolidated financial statements 

accounting for longlived assets — useful lives  we are required to make subjective assessments as to the useful lives of our tangible and intangible assets for purposes of determining depreciation amortization and accretion expense that if incorrectly estimated could be material to our consolidated financial statements depreciation expense for our property and equipment is computed using the straightline method over the estimated useful lives of our various classes of tangible assets the substantial portion of our property and equipment represents the cost of our communications infrastructure which is depreciated with an estimated useful life equal to the shorter of 1 20 years or 2 the term of the lease including optional renewals for the land interests under the communications infrastructure 

the useful life of our intangible assets is estimated based on the period over which the intangible asset is expected to benefit us and gives consideration to the expected useful life of other assets to which the useful life may relate we review the expected useful lives of our intangible assets on an ongoing basis and adjust if necessary amortization expense for intangible assets is computed using the straightline method over the estimated useful life of each of the intangible assets the useful life of the site rental contracts and customer relationships intangible assets is limited by the maximum depreciable life of the communications infrastructure 20 years as a result of the interdependency of the communications infrastructure and site rental contracts and customer relationships in contrast the site rental contracts and customer relationships are estimated to provide economic benefits for several decades because of the low rate of tenant cancellations and high rate of renewals experienced to date thus while site rental contracts and customer relationships are valued based upon the fair value of the site rental contracts and customer relationships which includes assumptions regarding both 1 tenants exercise of optional renewals contained in the acquired leases and 2 renewals of the acquired leases past the contractual term including exercisable options the site rental contracts are amortized over a period not to exceed 20 years as a result of the useful life being limited by the depreciable life of the communications infrastructure 

accounting for longlived assets — impairment evaluation  we review the carrying values of property and equipment intangible assets or other longlived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable we utilize the following dual grouping policy for purposes of determining the unit of account for testing impairment of the site rental contracts and customer relationships 



 42 

 we first pool site rental contracts and customer relationships intangible assets and property and equipment into portfolio groups for purposes of determining the unit of account for impairment testing because we view communications infrastructure as portfolios and communications infrastructure in a given portfolio and its related tenant contracts are not largely independent of the other communications infrastructure in the portfolio we reevaluate the appropriateness of the pooled groups at least annually this use of grouping is based in part on 1 our limitations regarding disposal of communications infrastructure 2 the interdependencies of communications infrastructure portfolios and 3 the manner in which communications infrastructure is traded in the marketplace the vast majority of our site rental contracts and customer relationships intangible assets and property and equipment are pooled into the us owned communications infrastructure group secondly and separately we pool site rental contracts and customer relationships by significant tenant or by tenant grouping for individually insignificant tenants as appropriate for purposes of determining the unit of account for impairment testing because we associate the value ascribed to site rental contracts and customer relationships intangible assets to the underlying contracts and related customer relationships acquired 

our determination that an adverse event or change in circumstance has occurred that indicates that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable will generally involve 1 a deterioration in an assets financial performance compared to historical results 2 a shortfall in an assets financial performance compared to forecasted results or 3 changes affecting the utility and estimated future demands for the asset when considering the utility of our assets we consider events that would meaningfully impact 1 our communications infrastructure or 2 our customer relationships for example consideration would be given to events that impact 1 the structural integrity and longevity of our communications infrastructure or 2 our ability to derive benefit from our existing customer relationships including events such as tenants bankruptcy or insolvency or loss of a significant customer during 2017  there were no events or circumstances that caused us to review the carrying value of our intangible assets or property and equipment due in part to our assets performing consistently with or better than our expectations 

if the sum of the estimated future cash flows undiscounted from an asset or portfolio group significant tenant or tenant group for individually insignificant tenants as applicable is less than its carrying amount an impairment loss may be recognized if the carrying value were to exceed the undiscounted cash flows measurement of an impairment loss would be based on the fair value of the asset which is based on an estimate of discounted future cash flows the most important estimates for such calculations of undiscounted cash flows are 1 the expected additions of new tenants and equipment on our communications infrastructure and 2 estimates regarding tenant cancellations and renewals of contracts we could record impairments in the future if changes in longterm market conditions expected future operating results or the utility of the assets results in changes for our impairment test calculations which negatively impact the fair value of our property and equipment and intangible assets or if we changed our unit of account in the future 

approximately 3  of our total towers currently have no tenants we continue to pay operating expenses on these towers in anticipation of obtaining tenants on these towers in the future primarily because of the individual tower site demographics we estimate based on current visibility potential tenants on approximately half of these towers to the extent we do not believe there are longterm prospects of obtaining tenants on an individual asset and all other possible avenues for recovering the carrying value has been exhausted including sale of the asset we appropriately reduce the carrying value of such assets to fair value 

accounting for goodwill — impairment evaluation  we test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis regardless of whether adverse events or changes in circumstances have occurred the annual test begins with goodwill and all intangible assets being allocated to applicable reporting units we then perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount if we conclude that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount we would be required to perform the twostep goodwill impairment test otherwise the twostep goodwill impairment test is not required our reporting units are the same as our operating segments towers and fiber see note 16 we performed our most recent annual goodwill impairment test as of october 1 2017  which resulted in no impairments this assessment included consideration of our market capitalization which was approximately four times the aggregate carrying amount of the reporting units as of december 31 2017  

deferred income taxes  we operate as a reit for us federal income tax purposes our reit taxable income is generally not subject to federal and state income taxes as a result of the deduction for dividends paid and any usage of our remaining nols accordingly the only provision or benefit for federal income taxes for the year ended december 31 2017  relates to trss furthermore as a result of the deduction for dividends paid some or all of our nols related to our reit may expire without utilization see  item 1 business—company developments reit status and industry update—reit status  for a discussion of the impact of our reit status 

 43 

our trss will continue to be subject as applicable to federal and state income taxes and foreign taxes in the jurisdictions in which such assets and operations are located our ability to utilize our nols is dependent in part upon us having sufficient future earnings to utilize our nols before they expire if market conditions change materially and we determine that we will be unable to generate sufficient taxable income in the future to utilize our nols we would be required to record an additional valuation allowance which would reduce our earnings such adjustments could cause a material effect on our results of operations for the period of the adjustment the change in our valuation allowance has no effect on our cash flows for a further discussion of our benefit provision for income taxes see item 7 mda—results of operations  and note 11  to our consolidated financial statements 

accounting pronouncements 

recently adopted accounting pronouncements  see note 2  to our consolidated financial statements 

recent accounting pronouncements not yet adopted see note 2  to our consolidated financial statements 

nongaap and segment financial measures 

in addition to the nongaap measures used herein and as discussed in note 16  to our consolidated financial statements we also provide 1 segment site rental gross margin 2 segment network services and other gross margin and 3 segment operating profit which are key measures used by management to evaluate our operating segments for purposes of making decisions about allocating capital and assessing performance these segment measures are provided pursuant to gaap requirements related to segment reporting 

we define segment site rental gross margin as segment site rental revenues less segment site rental cost of operations which excludes stockbased compensation expense and prepaid lease purchase price adjustments recorded in consolidated site rental cost of operations we define segment network services and other gross margin as segment network services and other revenues less segment network services and other cost of operations which excludes stockbased compensation expense recorded in consolidated network services and other cost of operations we define segment operating profit as segment revenues less segment cost of operations and segment general and administrative expenses excluding stockbased compensation recorded in cost of operations and general and administrative expenses and prepaid purchase price adjustments recorded in cost of operations 

we use earnings before interest taxes depreciation amortization and accretion as adjusted adjusted ebitda which is a nongaap financial measure as an indicator of consolidated financial performance our measure of adjusted ebitda may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies including companies in the communications infrastructure sector or other reits and is not a measure of performance calculated in accordance with gaap adjusted ebitda should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for operating income loss net income loss net cash provided by used for operating investing and financing activities or other income statement or cash flow statement data prepared in accordance with gaap and should be considered only as a supplement to net income loss computed in accordance with gaap as a measure of our performance there are material limitations to using a measure such as adjusted ebitda including the difficulty associated with comparing results among more than one company including our competitors and the inability to analyze certain significant items including depreciation and interest expense that directly affect our net income or loss management compensates for these limitations by considering the economic effect of the excluded expense items independently as well as in connection with their analysis of net income loss 

we define adjusted ebitda as net income loss plus restructuring charges credits asset writedown charges acquisition and integration costs depreciation amortization and accretion amortization of prepaid lease purchase price adjustments interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs gains losses on retirement of longterm obligations net gain loss on interest rate swaps gains losses on foreign currency swaps impairment of availableforsale securities interest income other income expense benefit provision for income taxes cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle income loss from discontinued operations and stockbased compensation expense the reconciliation of adjusted ebitda to our net income loss is set forth below and excludes items in our adjusted ebitda definition which are not applicable to the periods shown 

 44 



  

 we believe adjusted ebitda is useful to investors or other interested parties in evaluating our financial performance because 

 our management uses adjusted ebitda 

 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

our primary exposures to market risks are related to changes in interest rates which may adversely affect our results of operations and financial position we seek to manage exposure to changes in interest rates where economically prudent to do so by utilizing fixed rate debt 

 45 

our interest rate risk relates primarily to the impact of interest rate movements on the following after giving effect to our january 2018 senior notes offering and the application of the net proceeds therefrom 

 potential refinancing of existing debt 

we have no debt maturities other than principal payments on amortizing debt or anticipated repayment dates over the next 12 months as of december 31 2017  and december 31 2016  we had no interest rate swaps hedging any refinancings see below for a tabular presentation of our scheduled contractual debt maturities as of december 31 2017  and a discussion of anticipated repayment dates 

floating rate debt 

we manage our exposure to market interest rates on our existing debt by controlling the mix of fixed and floating rate debt as of december 31 2017  after giving effect to our january 2018 senior notes offering and the application of the net proceeds therefrom we had 30 billion of floating rate debt none of which had libor floors as a result a hypothetical unfavorable fluctuation in market interest rates on our existing debt of 18 of a percent point over a 12month period would increase our interest expense by approximately 4 million as of december 31 2016  we had approximately 20 billion of floating rate debt none of which had libor floors 

potential future borrowings of incremental debt 

we typically do not hedge our exposure to interest rates on potential future borrowings of incremental debt for a substantial period prior to issuance see item 7 mda—liquidity and capital resources  regarding our liquidity strategy 

 46 

the following table provides information about our market risk related to changes in interest rates the future principal payments and weightedaverage interest rates are presented as of december 31 2017  after giving effect to our january 2018 senior notes offering and the application of the net proceeds therefrom see note 19 to our consolidated financial statements these debt maturities reflect contractual maturity dates and do not consider the impact of the principal payments that will commence following the anticipated repayment dates of certain debt see footnotes b and d see note 8  to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our debt

 item 1 business 

overview 

we own operate and lease shared wireless infrastructure that is geographically dispersed throughout the united states and puerto rico us including 1 approximately 40000  towers and other structures such as rooftops collectively towers and 2 approximately 26500 route miles of fiber after giving effect to the fibernet acquisition as defined below primarily supporting small cell networks collectively small cells and together with towers wireless infrastructure our core business is providing access including space or capacity to our shared wireless infrastructure via longterm contracts in various forms including license sublease and lease agreements collectively leases we seek to increase our site rental revenues by adding more tenants on our shared wireless infrastructure which we expect to result in significant incremental cash flows due to our low incremental operating costs 

below is certain information concerning our business as of december 31 2016  

 certain information concerning our customers and site rental leases as of and for the year ended december 31 2016  is as follows 

 as part of our effort to provide comprehensive wireless infrastructure solutions we also offer certain network services relating to our wireless infrastructure consisting of 1 site development services relating to existing or new tenant equipment installations on our wireless infrastructure including site acquisition architectural and engineering or zoning and permitting collectively site development services and 2 tenant equipment installation or subsequent augmentations collectively installation services 

 1 

strategy 

our strategy is to create longterm stockholder value via a combination of 1 growing cash flows generated from our portfolio of wireless infrastructure 2 returning a meaningful portion of our cash provided by operating activities to our stockholders in the form of dividends and 3 investing capital efficiently to grow cash flows and longterm dividends per share we measure our efforts to create longterm stockholder value by the combined payment of dividends to stockholders and growth in our per share results the key elements of our strategy are to 

 our strategy to create longterm stockholder value is based on our belief that additional demand for our wireless infrastructure will be created by the expected continued growth in the demand for wireless connectivity we believe that such demand for our wireless infrastructure will continue will result in growth of our cash flows due to tenant additions on our existing wireless infrastructure and will create other growth opportunities for us such as demand for new wireless infrastructure 

2016  industry highlights and company developments 

see item 1 business—overview item 1 business—the company item 7 mda  and our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of certain recent developments and activities including 1 the increase in our quarterly common stock dividend 2 our recent debt and equity financing activities and 3 our change in operating segments during 2016 

fibernet acquisition on november 1 2016 we announced a definitive agreement to acquire fpl fibernet holdings llc and certain other subsidiaries of nextera energy inc collectively fibernet for approximately 15 billion in cash subject to certain limited adjustments fibernet acquisition fibernet is a fiber services provider in florida and texas that owns or has rights to approximately 11500 route miles of fiber installed and under construction inclusive of approximately 6000 route miles in top metro markets we believe that the fibernet assets will further support the demand for our wireless infrastructure on january 17 2017 we closed on the fibernet acquisition which was financed using proceeds from our november 2016 common stock offering november 2016 equity offering and borrowings under our revolving credit facility 2016 revolver 

reit status  we commenced operating as a reit for us federal income tax purposes effective january 1 2014 as a reit we are generally entitled to a deduction for dividends that we pay and therefore are not subject to us federal corporate income tax on our net taxable income that is currently distributed to our stockholders we also may be subject to certain federal state local and foreign taxes on our income or assets including 1 alternative minimum taxes 2 taxes on any undistributed income 3 taxes related to our taxable reit subsidiaries trss 4 certain state local or foreign income taxes 5 franchise taxes 6 property taxes and 7 transfer taxes in addition we could in certain circumstances be required to pay an excise or 

 2 

penalty tax which could be significant in amount in order to utilize one or more relief provisions under the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended code to maintain qualification for taxation as a reit 

in august 2014 we received a favorable private letter ruling from the internal revenue service irs which provides that the real property portion of our small cells business and the related rents qualify as real property and rents from real property respectively under the rules governing reits during the fourth quarter of 2015 we completed the necessary steps to include our small cells that were previously included in one or more whollyowned trss in the reit effective january 2016 

substantially all of our revenues are in the reit additionally we have included in trss certain other assets and operations those trs assets and operations will continue to be subject as applicable to federal and state corporate income taxes or to foreign taxes in the jurisdictions in which such assets and operations are located our foreign assets and operations including our tower operations in puerto rico most likely will be subject to foreign income taxes in the jurisdictions in which such assets and operations are located regardless of whether they are included in a trs or not 

to remain qualified and be taxed as a reit we will generally be required to distribute at least 90 of our reit taxable income after the utilization of our nols determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding net capital gain each year to our stockholders see notes 2  and 11  to our consolidated financial statements our quarterly common stock dividend will delay the utilization of our nols and may cause certain of the nols to expire without utilization 

industry update during 2016  consumer demand for wireless connectivity continued to grow due to increases in wireless data consumption and increased penetration of bandwidth intensive devices this growth in wireless consumption is driven by the increased usage of wireless applications including 1 mobile entertainment such as mobile video mobile applications and social networking 2 mobile internet usage such as email and web browsing and 3 machinetomachine applications also known as the internet of things as a result consumer wireless devices are trending toward bandwidthintensive devices including smartphones laptops tablets and other emerging devices 

we expect the following anticipated factors to contribute to potential demand for our wireless infrastructure 

 the company 

virtually all of our operations are located in the us our operating segments consist of towers and small cells for more information about our operating segments see note 16  to our consolidated financial statements and item 7 mda—change in operating segments  

our core business is providing access including space or capacity to our shared wireless infrastructure in the us which predominately consists of towers and small cells we predominately provide access to wireless carriers under longterm leases for their antennas which transmit a variety of signals related to wireless connectivity we believe our wireless infrastructure is integral to our customers networks and their ability to serve their customers see item 1 business—strategy 

we believe towers are the most efficient and costeffective solution for wireless carrier network deployments we acquired ownership interests or exclusive rights to the majority of our towers from the four largest wireless carriers or their predecessors through transactions consummated since 1999 including transactions with 1 att in 2013 att acquisition 2 tmobile in 2012 tmobile acquisition 3 global signal inc in 2007 global signal acquisition which had originally acquired the majority of its towers from sprint 4 companies now part of verizon wireless during 1999 and 2000 and 5 companies now part of att during 1999 and 2000 

more recently wireless carriers have been utilizing small cell networks to augment the capacity provided by towers and add capacity to their networks our small cells are typically located outdoors and are often attached to public rightofway infrastructure including utility poles or street lights we also offer fiber based solutions to businesses with high bandwidth demands such as enterprise government education and wholesale customers 

 3 

our small cells assets include those acquired from 1 nextg networks inc in 2012 nextg acquisition 2 the sunesys acquisition in 2015 sunesys acquisition and 3 the fibernet acquisition in january 2017 

we generally receive monthly rental payments from our towers and small cells tenants payable under longterm leases we have existing master lease agreements with most wireless carriers including att tmobile verizon wireless and sprint such agreements provide certain terms including economic terms that govern leases on our wireless infrastructure entered into by such carriers during the term of their master lease agreements we generally negotiate initial contract terms of five to 15 years with multiple renewal periods at the option of the tenant of five to ten years each and our leases typically include fixed escalations we continue to endeavor to negotiate with our existing customer base for longer contractual terms which often contain fixed escalation rates 

our tenant leases have historically had a high renewal rate with limited exceptions our tenant leases may not be terminated prior to the end of their current term and nonrenewals have averaged approximately 2 of site rental revenues over the last five years see item 1a risk factors  regarding future anticipated nonrenewals as a result of the decommissioning at least in part of the former leap wireless metropcs and clearwire networks acquired networks in general each tenant lease which is renewable will automatically renew at the end of its term unless the tenant provides prior notice of its intent not to renew see note 15  to our consolidated financial statements for a tabular presentation of the minimum rental cash payments due to us by tenants pursuant to tenant agreements without consideration of tenant renewal options 

the average monthly rental payment of a new tenant added to wireless infrastructure can vary based on 1 aggregate tenant volume 2 the different regions in the us or 3 the physical size weight and shape of the antenna installation or related equipment with respect to our small cells the amount of the monthly payments can also be influenced by the amount or cost of 1 construction for initial and subsequent tenants 2 fiber strands 3 equipment at the site or 4 any upfront payments received we also routinely receive rental payment increases in connection with lease amendments pursuant to which our tenants add additional antennas or other equipment to wireless infrastructure on which they already have equipment pursuant to preexisting leases 

approximately twothirds  of our direct site operating expenses consist of lease expenses and the remainder includes property taxes repairs and maintenance employee compensation or related benefit costs and utilities assuming current leasing activity levels our cash operating expenses generally tend to escalate at approximately the rate of inflation the addition of new tenants is achieved at a low incremental operating cost delivering high incremental returns to our business our wireless infrastructure portfolio requires minimal sustaining capital expenditures including maintenance or other nondiscretionary capital expenditures and are typically approximately 2  of net revenues see note 15  to our consolidated financial statements for a tabular presentation of the rental cash payments owed by us to landlords pursuant to our contractual agreements 

as part of our effort to provide comprehensive wireless infrastructure solutions we also offer certain network services relating to our wireless infrastructure predominately consisting of 1 site development services and 2 installation services the vast majority of our network service and other revenues relate to our towers segment for 2016  approximately 60  of our network services and other revenues related to installation services and the remainder predominately related to site development services we seek to grow our network service and other revenues by capitalizing on increased volumes that may result from carrier network upgrades promoting site development services expanding the scope of our services and focusing on customer service and deployment speed we have the capability and expertise to install with the assistance of our network of subcontractors equipment or antenna systems for our customers we do not always provide the installation services or site development services for our customers on our wireless infrastructure as third parties also provide these services see also —competition below these activities are typically nonrecurring and highly competitive with a number of local competitors in most markets typically our installation services are billed on a costplus profit basis and site development services are billed on a fixed fee basis 

customers  our towers customers are primarily comprised of large wireless carriers that operate national networks from whom we derive the vast majority of our towers segment revenues 

our small cells customers are generally large wireless carriers and businesses with high bandwidth demands such as enterprise government education and wholesale customers 

our four largest customers for both towers and small cells are att tmobile verizon wireless and sprint collectively these four customers accounted for 90  of our 2016  site rental revenues see item 1a risk factors  and note 16  to our consolidated financial statements 

sales and marketing  our sales organization markets both our towers and small cells with the objective of providing access to existing wireless infrastructure or to new wireless infrastructure prior to construction we seek to become the critical partner and preferred independent wireless infrastructure provider for our customers and increase customer satisfaction relative to our 

 4 

peers by leveraging our 1 existing wireless infrastructure footprint 2 customer relationships 3 processcentric approach 4 technological tools and 5 construction capabilities and expertise 

a team of national account directors maintains our relationships with our largest customers these directors work to develop wireless infrastructure leasing as well as to ensure that customers wireless infrastructure needs are efficiently translated into new leases on our wireless infrastructure sales personnel in our area offices develop and maintain local relationships with our customers that are expanding their networks entering new markets bringing new technologies to market or requiring maintenance or addon business in addition to our fulltime sales or marketing staff a number of senior managers and officers spend a significant portion of their time on sales and marketing activities and call on existing or prospective customers 

competition  we face competition for site rental tenants from various sources including 1 other independent wireless infrastructure owners or operators including competitors that own operate or manage towers rooftops broadcast towers utility poles fiber or small cells or 2 new alternative deployment methods in the wireless industry 

some of the larger companies with which we compete for towers business include american tower corporation and sba communications corporation some of the larger companies with which we compete for small cells business include other owners of fiber as well as new entrants into small cells we believe that location deployment speed quality of service capacity and price have been and will continue to be the most significant competitive factors affecting the leasing of wireless infrastructure see item 1a risk factors 

competitors to our network services offering include site acquisition consultants zoning consultants real estate firms rightofway consulting firms construction companies tower owners or managers radio frequency engineering consultants telecommunications equipment vendors who can provide turnkey site development services through multiple subcontractors or our customers internal staff we believe that our customers base their decisions on the outsourcing of network services on criteria such as a companys experience track record local reputation price or time for completion of a project 

employees 

at january 31 2017  we employed approximately 3200 people we are not a party to any collective bargaining agreements we have not experienced any strikes or work stoppages and management believes that our employee relations are satisfactory 

regulatory and environmental matters 

we are required to comply with a variety of federal state and local regulations and laws in the us including fcc and federal aviation administration faa regulations and those discussed under —environmental  below to date we have not incurred any material fines or penalties or experienced any material adverse effects to our business as a result of any domestic or international regulations the summary below is based on regulations currently in effect and such regulations are subject to review or modification by the applicable governmental authority from time to time if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations we may be fined or even lose our rights to conduct some of our business 

federal regulations  both the fcc and the faa regulate towers used for wireless communications radio or television broadcasting such regulations control the siting lighting or marking of towers and may depending on the characteristics of particular towers require the registration of tower facilities with the fcc and the issuance of determinations confirming no hazard to air traffic wireless communications devices operating on towers are separately regulated and independently licensed based upon the particular frequency used in addition the fcc and the faa have developed standards to consider proposals for new or modified tower or antenna structures based upon the height or location including proximity to airports proposals to construct or to modify existing tower or antenna structures above certain heights are reviewed by the faa to ensure the structure will not present a hazard to aviation which determination may be conditioned upon compliance with lighting or marking requirements the fcc requires its licensees to operate communications devices only on towers that comply with faa rules and are registered with the fcc if required by its regulations where tower lighting is required by faa regulation tower owners bear the responsibility of notifying the faa of any tower lighting outage and ensuring the timely restoration of such outages failure to comply with the applicable requirements may lead to civil penalties 

local regulations  the us telecommunications act of 1996 amended the communications act of 1934 to preserve state and local zoning authorities jurisdiction over the siting of communications towers and small cells the law however limits local zoning authority by prohibiting actions by local authorities that discriminate between different service providers of wireless communications or ban altogether the provision of wireless communications additionally the law prohibits state and local restrictions based on the environmental effects of radio frequency emissions to the extent the facilities comply with fcc regulations 

local regulations include city and other local ordinances including subdivision and zoning ordinances approvals for construction modification and removal of towers and small cells and restrictive covenants imposed by community developers 

 5 

these regulations vary greatly but typically require us to obtain approval from local officials prior to tower construction local zoning authorities may render decisions that prevent the construction or modification of towers or place conditions on such construction or modifications that are responsive to community residents concerns regarding the height visibility or other characteristics of the towers over the last several years there have been several developments related to fcc regulations and legislation that assist in expediting and streamlining the deployment of wireless networks including establishing timeframes for reviews by local and state governments notwithstanding such legislative and fcc actions decisions of local zoning authorities may also adversely affect the timing or cost of wireless infrastructure construction or modification 

certain of our small cells related subsidiaries hold authorizations to provide intrastate telecommunication services as competitive local exchange carriers clec in numerous states and to provide domestic interstate telecommunication services as authorized by the fcc these small cells subsidiaries are primarily regulated by state public service commissions clec status in certain cases helps promote access to public rightsofway which is beneficial to the deployment of our small cells on a timely basis status as a clec often allows us to deploy our small cells in locations where zoning restrictions might otherwise delay restrict or prevent building or expanding traditional wireless tower sites or traditional wireless rooftop sites see item 1a risk factors 

environmental we are required to comply with a variety of federal state and local environmental laws and regulations protecting environmental quality including air and water quality and wildlife protection to date we have not incurred any material fines or penalties or experienced any material adverse effects to our business as a result of any domestic or international environmental regulations or matters see item 1a risk factors 

the construction of new towers or in some cases the modification of existing towers in the us may be subject to environmental review under the national environmental policy act of 1969 as amended nepa which requires federal agencies to evaluate the environmental impact of major federal actions the fcc has promulgated regulations implementing nepa which require applicants to investigate the potential environmental impact of the proposed tower construction should the proposed tower construction present a significant environmental impact the fcc must prepare an environmental impact statement subject to public comment if the proposed construction or modification of a tower may have a significant impact on the environment the fccs approval of the construction or modification could be significantly delayed 

our operations are subject to federal state and local laws and regulations relating to the management use storage disposal emission or remediation of or exposure to hazardous or nonhazardous substances materials or wastes as an owner lessee or operator of real property we are subject to certain environmental laws that impose strict jointandseveral liability for the cleanup of onsite or offsite contamination relating to existing or historical operations or we could also be subject to personal injury or property damage claims relating to such contamination in general our customer contracts prohibit our customers from using or storing any hazardous substances on our tower sites in violation of applicable environmental laws and require our customers to provide notice of certain environmental conditions caused by them 

as licensees and wireless infrastructure owners we are also subject to regulations and guidelines that impose a variety of operational requirements relating to radio frequency emissions as employers we are subject to occupational safety and health administration and similar guidelines regarding employee protection from radio frequency exposure the potential connection between radio frequency emissions and certain negative health effects including some forms of cancer has been the subject of substantial study by the scientific community in recent years 

we have compliance programs and monitoring projects to help assure that we are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws nevertheless there can be no assurance that the costs of compliance with existing or future environmental laws will not have a material adverse effect on us 

other regulations  we hold through certain of our subsidiaries licenses for common carrier microwave service which are subject to additional regulation by the fcc we also hold a nationwide fcc license relating to the 16701675 mhz spectrum spectrum which we have leased to a third party through 2023 subject to the lessees option to purchase the spectrum

 item 1a risk factors 

you should carefully consider all of the risks described below as well as the other information contained in this document when evaluating your investment in our securities 

risks relating to our business 

our business depends on the demand for our wireless infrastructure driven primarily by demand for wireless connectivity and we may be adversely affected by any slowdown in such demand additionally a reduction in the amount or change in the mix of carrier network investment may materially and adversely affect our business including reducing demand for tenant additions or network services 

demand for our wireless infrastructure from our customers depends on the demand for wireless connectivity from their customers the willingness of our customers to utilize our wireless infrastructure or renew or extend existing leases on our wireless infrastructure is affected by numerous factors including 

 a slowdown in demand for wireless connectivity or our wireless infrastructure may negatively impact our growth or otherwise have a material adverse effect on us if our customers or potential customers are unable to raise adequate capital to fund their business plans as a result of disruptions in the financial and credit markets or otherwise they may reduce their spending which could adversely affect our anticipated growth or the demand for our wireless infrastructure or network services 

the amount timing and mix of our customers network investment is variable and can be significantly impacted by the various matters described in these risk factors changes in carrier network investment typically impact the demand for our wireless infrastructure as a result changes in carrier plans such as delays in the implementation of new systems new technologies including small cells or plans to expand coverage or capacity may reduce demand for our wireless infrastructure furthermore the wireless industry could experience a slowdown or slowing growth rates as a result of numerous factors including a reduction in consumer demand for wireless connectivity or general economic conditions there can be no assurances that weakness or uncertainty in the economic environment will not adversely impact the wireless industry which may materially and adversely affect our business including by reducing demand for our wireless infrastructure or network services in addition a slowdown may increase competition for site rental customers or network services a wireless industry slowdown or a reduction in carrier network investment may materially and adversely affect our business for a further discussion of our risks relating to network services see  —our network services business has historically experienced significant volatility in demand which reduces the predictability of our results below 

 7 

a substantial portion of our revenues is derived from a small number of customers and the loss consolidation or financial instability of any of our limited number of customers may materially decrease revenues or reduce demand for our wireless infrastructure and network services 

for 2016  our site rental revenues by customer were as follows 

the loss of any one of our large customers as a result of consolidation merger bankruptcy insolvency network sharing roaming joint development resale agreements by our customers or otherwise may result in 1 a material decrease in our revenues 2 uncollectible account receivables 3 an impairment of our deferred site rental receivables wireless infrastructure assets intangible assets or 4 other adverse effects to our business we cannot guarantee that leases with our major customers will not be terminated or that these customers will renew their leases with us in addition to our four largest customers we also derive a portion of our revenues and anticipated future growth from new entrants offering or contemplating offering wireless services such customers may be smaller or have less financial resources than our four largest customers have business models which may not be successful or may require additional capital see also item 1 business—the company  and note 16  to our consolidated financial statements 

consolidation among our customers will likely result in duplicate or overlapping parts of networks for example where they are coresidents on a tower which may result in the termination or nonrenewal of tenant leases and impact revenues from our wireless infrastructure we expect that any termination of tenant leases as a result of this potential consolidation would be spread over multiple years such consolidation may result in a reduction in such customers future network investment in the aggregate because their expansion plans may be similar wireless carrier consolidation could decrease the demand for our wireless infrastructure which in turn may result in a reduction in our revenues or cash flows 

in recent years att tmobile and sprint acquired leap wireless metropcs and clearwire respectively during 2017  we expect site rental revenues to be impacted by nonrenewals of 50 million to 60 million as a result of the decommissioning of the acquired networks the acquired networks represented approximately 9  of our net revenues for the year ended december 31 2016  we currently expect potential nonrenewals from the decommissioning of the acquired networks to be approximately 60 of current runrate site rental revenues related to the acquired networks with the majority of such nonrenewals to occur through the end of 2018 depending on the eventual network deployment and decommissioning plans of att tmobile and sprint the impact and timing of such nonrenewals may vary from our expectations 

see note 15  to our consolidated financial statements for a tabular presentation of the minimum rental cash payments due to us by tenants pursuant to tenant agreements without consideration of tenant renewal options 

the business model for small cells contains certain differences from our traditional site rental business resulting in different operational risks if we do not successfully operate that business model or identify or manage those operational risks such operations may produce results that are less than anticipated 

the business model for our small cells operations contains certain differences from our traditional towers operations including differences relating to customer contract terms landlord demographics ownership of certain network assets operational oversight requirements including requirements for service level agreements regarding network performance and maintenance growth rates and applicable laws while our small cells operations have certain risks that are similar to our towers operations they also have certain operational risks that are different from our traditional site rental business including the 1 use of competitive local 

 8 

exchange carrier which we refer to as clec status 2 use of public rightsofways and franchise agreements 3 use of poles owned solely by or jointly with third parties 4 risks relating to overbuilding 5 risks relating to construction management 6 risks relating to network data security or 7 potential damage to our overall reputation as a wireless infrastructure provider we cannot be certain that we will be successful in maintaining rightofway agreements obtaining future agreements on acceptable terms or that our clec status will be recognized in addition the rate at which wireless carriers adopt or prioritize small cells may be lower or slower than we anticipate or may cease to exist altogether our small cells operations will also expose us to different safety or liability risks or hazards than our traditional site rental business as a result of numerous factors including the location or nature of the assets involved there may be risks and challenges associated with small cells being comparatively new technologies and continuing to evolve and there may be other risks related to small cells of which we are not yet aware 

our substantial level of indebtedness could adversely affect our ability to react to changes in our business and the terms of our debt instruments limit our ability to take a number of actions that our management might otherwise believe to be in our best interests in addition if we fail to comply with our covenants our debt could be accelerated 

as a result of our substantial indebtedness 

 currently we have debt instruments in place that limit in certain circumstances our ability to incur additional indebtedness pay dividends create liens sell assets or engage in certain mergers and acquisitions among other things in addition the credit agreement governing our senior unsecured credit facility agreement 2016 credit facility contains financial maintenance covenants our ability to comply with these covenants or to satisfy our debt obligations will depend on our future operating performance if we violate the restrictions in our debt instruments or fail to comply with our financial maintenance covenants we will be in default under those instruments which in some cases would cause the maturity of a substantial portion of our longterm indebtedness to be accelerated furthermore if the limits on our ability to pay dividends prevent us from satisfying our reit distribution requirements we could fail to remain qualified for taxation as a reit if these limits do not jeopardize our qualification for taxation as a reit but nevertheless prevent us from distributing 100 of our reit taxable income we will be subject to federal and state corporate income taxes and potentially a nondeductible excise tax on our undistributed taxable income if our operating subsidiaries were to default on their debt the trustee could seek to foreclose the collateral securing such debt in which case we could lose the wireless infrastructure and the revenues associated with the wireless infrastructure see item 7 mda—liquidity and capital resources—debt covenants  for a further discussion of our debt covenants 

ccic is a holding company that conducts all of its operations through its subsidiaries accordingly ccics sources of cash to pay interest or principal on its outstanding indebtedness are distributions relating to its respective ownership interests in its subsidiaries from the net earnings and cash flows generated by such subsidiaries or from proceeds of debt or equity offerings earnings and cash flows generated by ccics subsidiaries are first applied by such subsidiaries to conduct their operations including servicing their respective debt obligations after which any excess cash flows generally may be paid to such holding company in the absence of any special conditions such as a continuing event of default however ccics subsidiaries are legally distinct from the holding company and unless they guarantee such debt have no obligation to pay amounts due on their debt or to make funds available to us for such payment 

 9 

we have a substantial amount of indebtedness in the event we do not repay or refinance such indebtedness we could face substantial liquidity issues and might be required to issue equity securities or securities convertible into equity securities or sell some of our assets to meet our debt payment obligations 

we have a substantial amount of indebtedness approximately 132 billion as of february 15 2017  which upon final maturity we will need to refinance or repay see item 7 mda—liquidity and capital resources  for a tabular presentation of our contractual debt maturities there can be no assurances we will be able to refinance our indebtedness 1 on commercially reasonable terms 2 on terms including with respect to interest rates as favorable as our current debt or 3 at all 

economic conditions and the credit markets have historically experienced and may continue to experience periods of volatility uncertainty or weakness that could impact the availability or cost of debt financing including any refinancing of the obligations described above or on our ability to draw the full amount of our 25 billion 2016 revolver that as of february 15 2017  has 24 billion  of undrawn availability 

if we are unable to repay or refinance our debt we cannot guarantee that we will be able to generate enough cash flows from operations or that we will be able to obtain enough capital to service our debt fund our planned capital expenditures or pay future dividends in such an event we could face substantial liquidity issues and might be required to issue equity securities or securities convertible into equity securities or sell some of our assets to meet our debt payment obligations failure to repay or refinance indebtedness when required could result in a default under such indebtedness if we incur additional indebtedness any such indebtedness could exacerbate the risks described above 

sales or issuances of a substantial number of shares of our common stock may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

future sales or issuances of common stock or other equity related securities may adversely affect the market price of our common stock including any shares of our common stock issued to finance capital expenditures finance acquisitions or repay debt our business strategy contemplates access to external financing to fund certain discretionary investments which may include issuances of common stock or other equity related securities in august 2015 we established an atthemarket stock offering program atm program through which we may from time to time issue and sell shares of our common stock having an aggregate gross sales price of up to 5000 million to or through sales agents as of february 15 2017  we had approximately 173 million of gross sales of common stock remaining on our atm program see note 12 to our consolidated financial statements as of february 15 2017  we had 361  million shares of common stock outstanding 

we have reserved 120 million  shares of common stock for issuance in connection with awards granted under our various stock compensation plans 

further a small number of common stockholders own a significant percentage of our outstanding common stock if any one of these common stockholders or any group of our common stockholders sells a large quantity of shares of our common stock or the public market perceives that existing common stockholders might sell a large quantity of shares of our common stock the market price of our common stock may significantly decline 

as a result of competition in our industry we may find it more difficult to achieve favorable rental rates on our new or renewing tenant leases 

our growth is dependent on our entering into new tenant leases including amendments to leases upon modification of an existing installation as well as renewing or renegotiating tenant leases when existing tenant leases terminate competition in our industry may make it more difficult for us to attract new customers maintain or increase our gross margins or maintain or increase our market share we face competition for site rental tenants and associated rental rates from various sources including 1 other independent wireless infrastructure owners or operators including those that own operate or manage towers rooftops broadcast towers utility poles fiber including nontraditional competitors such as cable providers or small cells or 2 new alternative deployment methods in the wireless industry 

our small cell operations may have different competitors than our traditional site rental business including other owners of fiber as well as new entrants into small cells some of which may have larger networks or greater financial resources than we have 

new technologies may reduce demand for our wireless infrastructure or negatively impact our revenues 

improvements in the efficiency architecture and design of wireless networks may reduce the demand for our wireless infrastructure for example new technologies that may promote network sharing joint development wireless backhaul or resale agreements by our customers such as signal combining technologies or network functions virtualization may reduce the need for our wireless infrastructure in addition other technologies such as wifi distributed antenna systems das femtocells other

small cells or satellite such as low earth orbiting and mesh transmission systems may in the future serve as substitutes for or alternatives to leasing that might otherwise be anticipated or expected on wireless infrastructure had such technologies not existed in addition new technologies that enhance the range efficiency and capacity of wireless equipment could reduce demand for our wireless infrastructure any significant reduction in demand for our wireless infrastructure resulting from the new technologies may negatively impact our revenues or otherwise have a material adverse effect on us 

the expansion or development of our business including through acquisitions increased product offerings or other strategic growth opportunities may cause disruptions in our business which may have an adverse effect on our business operations or financial results 

we seek to expand and develop our business including through acquisitions such as the fibernet acquisition increased product offerings such as small cells and fiber or other strategic growth opportunities in the ordinary course of our business we review analyze and evaluate various potential transactions or other activities in which we may engage such transactions or activities could cause disruptions in increase risk or otherwise negatively impact our business among other things such transactions and activities may 

 if we fail to retain rights to our wireless infrastructure including the land interests under our towers our business may be adversely affected 

the property interests on which our wireless infrastructure resides including the land interests under our towers consist of leasehold and subleasehold interests fee interests easements licenses and rightsofway a loss of these interests may interfere with our ability to conduct our business or generate revenues for various reasons we may not always have the ability to access analyze or verify all information regarding titles or other issues prior to purchasing wireless infrastructure further we may not be able to renew ground leases on commercially viable terms our ability to retain rights to the land interests on which our towers reside depends on our ability to purchase such land including fee interests and perpetual easements or renegotiate or extend the terms of the leases relating to such land approximately 11  of our towers site rental gross margins for the year ended december 31 2016  was derived from towers where the leases for the interests under such towers had final expiration dates of less than ten years if we are unable to retain rights to the property interests on which our wireless infrastructure resides our business may be adversely affected 

as of december 31 2016  approximately 53  of our towers were leased or subleased or operated and managed under master leases subleases or other agreements with att sprint and tmobile we have the option to purchase these towers at the end of their respective lease terms we have no obligation to exercise such purchase options we may not have the required available capital to exercise our right to purchase some or all of these towers at the time these options are exercisable even if we do have available capital we may choose not to exercise our right to purchase these towers or some or all of the tmobile or att towers for business or other reasons in the event that we do not exercise these purchase rights or are otherwise unable to acquire an interest that would allow us to continue to operate these towers after the applicable period we will lose the cash flows derived from such towers which may have a material adverse effect on our business in the event that we decide to exercise these purchase rights the benefits of the acquisition of these towers may not exceed the costs which could adversely affect our business additional information concerning these towers and the applicable purchase options as of december 31 2016  is as follows 



 11 

 under master lease or master prepaid lease arrangements we have with att sprint and tmobile certain of our subsidiaries lease or sublease or are otherwise granted the right to manage and operate towers from bankruptcy remote subsidiaries of such carriers if one of these bankruptcy remote subsidiaries should become a debtor in a bankruptcy proceeding and is permitted to reject the underlying ground lease our subsidiaries could lose their interest in the applicable sites if our subsidiaries were to lose their interest in the applicable sites or if the applicable ground leases were to be terminated we would lose the cash flow derived from the towers on those sites which may have a material adverse effect on our business we have similar bankruptcy risks with respect to sites that we operate under management agreements 

our network services business has historically experienced significant volatility in demand which reduces the predictability of our results 

the operating results of our network services business for any particular period may vary significantly and should not necessarily be considered indicative of longerterm results for this activity our network services business is generally driven by demand for our wireless infrastructure and may be adversely impacted by various factors including 

 new wireless technologies may not deploy or be adopted by customers as rapidly or in the manner projected 

there can be no assurances that new wireless services or technologies will be introduced or deployed as rapidly or in the manner projected by the wireless carriers in addition demand or customer adoption rates for such new technologies may be lower or slower than anticipated for numerous reasons as a result growth opportunities or demand for our wireless infrastructure arising from such technologies may not be realized at the times or to the extent anticipated 

if we fail to comply with laws or regulations which regulate our business and which may change at any time we may be fined or even lose our right to conduct some of our business 

a variety of federal state local and foreign laws and regulations apply to our business including those discussed in item 1 business   failure to comply with applicable requirements may lead to civil penalties or require us to assume indemnification obligations or breach contractual provisions we cannot guarantee that existing or future laws or regulations including federal state or local tax laws will not adversely affect our business including our reit status increase delays or result in additional costs these factors may have a material adverse effect on us 

if radio frequency emissions from wireless handsets or equipment on our wireless infrastructure are demonstrated to cause negative health effects potential future claims could adversely affect our operations costs or revenues 

the potential connection between radio frequency emissions and certain negative health effects including some forms of cancer has been the subject of substantial study by the scientific community in recent years we cannot guarantee that claims relating to radio frequency emissions will not arise in the future or that the results of such studies will not be adverse to us 

public perception of possible health risks associated with cellular or other wireless connectivity services may slow or diminish the growth of wireless companies which may in turn slow or diminish our growth in particular negative public perception of 

 12 

and regulations regarding these perceived health risks may slow or diminish the market acceptance of wireless services if a connection between radio frequency emissions and possible negative health effects were established our operations costs or revenues may be materially and adversely affected we currently do not maintain any significant insurance with respect to these matters 

certain provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation charter amended and restated bylaws bylaws and operative agreements and domestic and international competition laws may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us or for us to acquire control of a third party even if such a change in control would be beneficial to our stockholders 

we have a number of antitakeover devices in place that will hinder takeover attempts or may reduce the market value of our common stock our antitakeover provisions include 

 our bylaws permit special meetings of the stockholders to be called only upon the request of our chief executive officer or a majority of the board of directors and deny stockholders the ability to call such meetings such provisions as well as the provisions of section 203 of the delaware general corporation law may impede a merger consolidation takeover or other business combination or discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us 

in addition domestic or international competition laws may prevent or discourage us from acquiring wireless infrastructure in certain geographical areas or impede a merger consolidation takeover or other business combination or discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us 

we may be vulnerable to security breaches that could adversely affect our operations business and reputation 

despite existing security measures certain of our wireless infrastructure may be vulnerable to damage disruptions or shutdowns due to unauthorized access computer viruses cyberattacks and other security breaches an attack attempt or security breach such as a distributed denial of service attack could potentially result in 1 interruption or cessation of certain of our services to our customers 2 our inability to meet expected levels of service or 3 data transmitted over our customers networks being compromised we cannot guarantee that our security measures will not be circumvented resulting in customer network failures or interruptions that could impact our customers network availability and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or operational results we may be required to expend significant resources to protect against or recover from such threats if an actual or perceived breach of our security occurs the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed and we could lose customers further the perpetrators of cyberattacks are not restricted to particular groups or persons these attacks may be committed by our employees or external actors operating in any geography any such events could result in legal claims or penalties disruption in operations misappropriation of sensitive data damage to our reputation negative market perception or costly response measures which could adversely affect our business 

risks relating to our reit status 

future dividend payments to our stockholders will reduce the availability of our cash on hand available to fund future discretionary investments and may result in a need to incur indebtedness or issue equity securities to fund growth opportunities in such event the then current economic credit market or equity market conditions will impact the availability or cost of such financing which may hinder our ability to grow our per share results of operations 

during each of the first three quarters of 2016 we paid a quarterly common stock dividend of 0885 per share totaling approximately 8966 million in october 2016 we increased our quarterly dividend beginning in the fourth quarter of 2016 from an annual amount of 354 per share to an annual amount of 380 per share as such we declared a quarterly dividend of 095 per share in october 2016 which represented an increase of 7 from the quarterly dividend declared during each of the first three quarters of 2016 we currently expect such dividends to result in aggregate annual cash payments of approximately 13 billion during the next 12 months over time we expect to increase our dividend per share generally commensurate with our realized growth in cash flows future dividends are subject to the approval of our board of directors see notes 12  and 19  to our consolidated financial statements 

we operate as a reit for us federal income tax purposes to remain qualified and be taxed as a reit we will generally be required to distribute at least 90 of our reit taxable income after the utilization of any available nols determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding net capital gain each year to our stockholders our quarterly cash common stock dividend will delay the utilization of our nols and may cause certain of the nols to expire without utilization see also

item 7 mda—general overview—common stock dividend  and item 1 business—2016 industry highlights and company developments—reit status 

as discussed in item 1 mda—business—strategy  we seek to invest our capital including the net cash provided by our operating activities as well as external financing sources in a manner that we believe will increase longterm stockholder value on a riskadjusted basis our historical discretionary investments have included the following in no particular order purchasing our common stock acquiring or constructing wireless infrastructure acquiring land interests under towers improving or structurally enhancing our existing wireless infrastructure or purchasing repaying or redeeming our debt external financing including debt equity and equityrelated issuances to fund future discretionary investments either 1 may not be available to us or 2 may not be accessible by us at terms that would result in the investment of the net proceeds raised yielding incremental growth in our per share operating results as a result future dividend payments may hinder our ability to grow our per share results of operations or otherwise adversely affect our ability to execute our business plan 

remaining qualified to be taxed as a reit involves highly technical and complex provisions of the us internal revenue code failure to remain qualified as a reit would result in our inability to deduct dividends to stockholders when computing our taxable income which would reduce our available cash 

we operate as a reit for us federal tax purposes as a reit we are generally entitled to a deduction for dividends that we pay and therefore are not subject to us federal corporate income tax on our net taxable income that is currently distributed to our common stockholders 

while we intend to operate so that we remain qualified as a reit given the highly complex nature of the rules governing reits the ongoing importance of factual determinations the possibility of future changes in our circumstances and the potential impact of future changes to laws and regulations impacting reits no assurance can be given that we will qualify as a reit for any particular year 

certain government officials including members of the us congress and executive branch have called for substantial changes to fiscal and tax policies which may include comprehensive tax reform we cannot predict the impact if any that these changes if enacted might have on our business however it is possible that such changes could adversely affect our business including our reit status 

if in any taxable year we fail to qualify for taxation as a reit and are not entitled to relief under the code then 

 although we may have federal nols available to reduce any taxable income to the extent our federal nols have been utilized or are otherwise unavailable any such corporate tax liability could be substantial would reduce the amount of cash available for other purposes and might necessitate the borrowing of additional funds or the liquidation of some investments to pay any additional tax liability accordingly funds available for investment would be reduced 

under the code for taxable years beginning before 2018 no more than 25 of the value of the assets of a reit may be represented by securities of one or more trss or other nonqualifying assets for taxable years beginning in 2018 the limit on the value of assets of a reit that may be represented by securities of one or more trss or other nonqualifying assets will reduce to 20 these current or future limitations may affect our ability to make additional investments in nonreit qualifying operations or assets or in any operations held through trss the net income of our trss is not required to be distributed to us and income that is not distributed to us generally will not be subject to the reit income distribution requirement however there may be limitations on our ability to accumulate earnings in our trss and the accumulation or reinvestment of significant earnings in our trss could result in adverse tax treatment in particular if the accumulation of cash in our trss causes the fair market value of our securities in our trss or certain other nonqualifying assets to exceed current or future limitations of the fair market value of our assets at the end of any quarter then we may fail to remain qualified as a reit 

 14 

complying with reit requirements including the 90 distribution requirement may limit our flexibility or cause us to forgo otherwise attractive opportunities including certain discretionary investments and potential financing alternatives 

to remain qualified and be taxed as a reit we will generally be required to distribute at least 90 of our reit taxable income after the utilization of any available nols determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding net capital gain each year to our stockholders we commenced declaring regular quarterly dividends to our common stockholders beginning with the first quarter of 2014 see notes 12  and 19  to our consolidated financial statements any such dividends however are subject to the determination and approval of our board of directors based on thencurrent and anticipated future conditions including our earnings net cash provided by operating activities capital requirements financial condition our relative market capitalization our existing federal nols of approximately 13 billion  of which substantially all are available to offset reit taxable income or other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors 

to the extent that we satisfy the 90 distribution requirement but distribute less than 100 of our reit taxable income after the application of available nols if any we will be subject to federal corporate income tax on our undistributed taxable income in addition we will be subject to a 4 nondeductible excise tax if the actual amount that we pay out to our stockholders for a calendar year is less than a minimum amount specified under the code 

from time to time we may generate reit taxable income greater than our cash flow as a result of differences in timing between the recognition of taxable income and the actual receipt of cash or the effect of nondeductible capital expenditures the creation of reserves or required debt or amortization payments if we do not have other funds available in these situations we could be required to borrow funds on unfavorable terms sell assets at disadvantageous prices or distribute amounts that would otherwise be invested in future acquisitions to make distributions sufficient to enable us to pay out enough of our taxable income to satisfy the reit dividend requirement and to avoid corporate income tax and the 4 excise tax in a particular year these alternatives could increase our costs or reduce our equity thus compliance with the reit requirements may hinder our ability to grow which could adversely affect the value of our common stock furthermore the reit dividend requirements may increase the financing we need to fund capital expenditures future growth or expansion initiatives which would increase our total leverage 

in addition to satisfying the distribution test to remain qualified as a reit for tax purposes we will need to continually satisfy tests concerning among other things the sources of our income the nature and diversification of our assets and the ownership of our capital stock compliance with these tests will require us to refrain from certain activities and may hinder our ability to make certain attractive investments including the purchase of nonqualifying assets the expansion of nonreal estate activities or investments in the businesses to be conducted by our trss and to that extent limit our opportunities and our flexibility to change our business strategy furthermore acquisition opportunities in domestic or international markets may be adversely affected if we need or require the target company to comply with some reit requirements prior to completing any such acquisition in addition our conversion to a reit may result in investor pressures not to pursue growth opportunities that are not immediately accretive 

moreover if we fail to comply with certain asset ownership tests at the end of any calendar quarter we must correct the failure within 30 days after the end of the calendar quarter or qualify for certain statutory relief provisions to avoid losing our reit qualification as a result we may be required to liquidate assets in adverse market conditions or forgo otherwise attractive investments these actions may reduce our income and amounts available for distribution to our stockholders 

reit related ownership limitations and transfer restrictions may prevent or restrict certain transfers of our capital stock 

in order for us to continue to satisfy the requirements for reit qualification our capital stock must be beneficially owned by 100 or more persons during at least 335 days of a taxable year of 12 months or during a proportionate part of a shorter taxable year other than the first year for which an election to be a reit has been made also not more than 50 of the value of the outstanding shares of our capital stock may be owned directly or indirectly by five or fewer “individuals” as defined in the code to include certain entities such as private foundations during the last half of a taxable year other than the first taxable year for which an election to be a reit has been made in order to facilitate compliance with the reit rules our charter includes provisions that implement reitrelated ownership limitations and transfer restrictions that generally prohibit any person as defined in our charter from beneficially or constructively owning or being deemed to beneficially or constructively own by virtue of the attribution provisions of the code more than 98 by value or number of shares whichever is more restrictive of the outstanding shares of our common stock or 98 in aggregate value of the outstanding shares of all classes and series of our capital stock in addition our charter provides for certain other ownership limitations and transfer restrictions under applicable constructive ownership rules any shares of capital stock owned by certain affiliated owners generally would be added together for purposes of the ownership limitations these ownership limitations and transfer restrictions could have the effect of delaying deferring or preventing a transaction or a change in control of our company that might involve a premium price for our capital stock or otherwise might be in the best interest of our stockholders

business fundamentals and results 

the following are certain highlights of our business fundamentals and results   as of and for the year ended december 31 2016  



 24 

 change in operating segments 

during the first quarter of 2016 we changed our operating segments to consist of towers and small cells this change was a result of growth in small cells from a combination of organic growth capital expenditures and acquisitions as well as the continued progression of the integration of sunesys which led to changes in how our chief operating decision maker codm reviews financial information 

our operating segment change aligns with how the codm views and evaluates our operations including how the codm allocates capital and assesses segment performance we have recast our prior period presentation to conform to our current reporting presentation 

towers our towers segment which represented 88  of our revenues during 2016  provides access including space or capacity to our approximately 40000 towers geographically dispersed throughout the us our towers have a significant presence in the top 100 btas the towers segment also reflects certain network services relating to our towers consisting of site development services and installation services 

we acquired ownership interests or exclusive rights to the majority of our towers from the four largest wireless carriers or their predecessors through transactions consummated since 1999 including transactions with 1 att in 2013 2 tmobile in 2012 3 global signal inc in 2007 which had originally acquired the majority of its towers from sprint 4 companies now part of verizon wireless during 1999 and 2000 and 5 companies now part of att during 1999 and 2000 

small cells our small cells segment which represented 12  of our revenues during 2016  provides access including space or capacity to our approximately 26500 route miles of fiber after giving effect to the fibernet acquisition primarily supporting small cell networks to a lesser extent the small cells segment also offers fiber based solutions our small cells assets include those acquired from nextg networks inc in 2012 sunesys in 2015 and fibernet in 2017 our customers in small cells generally are large wireless carriers and businesses with high bandwidth demands such as enterprise government education and wholesale customers see also  item 1 business   

 25 

common stock dividend 

in aggregate we paid approximately 12 billion in common stock dividends in 2016 during each of the first three quarters of 2016 we paid a quarterly common stock dividend of 0885 per share totaling approximately 8966 million in october 2016 we increased our quarterly dividend beginning in the fourth quarter of 2016 from an annual amount of 354 per share to an annual amount of 380 per share as such we declared a quarterly dividend of 095 per share in october 2016 which represented an increase of 7 from the quarterly dividend declared during each of the first three quarters of 2016 we currently expect such dividends to result in aggregate annual cash payments of at least 13 billion during the next 12 months or an annualized amount of 380 per share over time we expect to increase our dividend per share generally commensurate with our realized growth in cash flows future dividends are subject to the approval of our board of directors see notes 12  and 19  to our consolidated financial statements 

fibernet acquisition 

on november 1 2016 we announced a definitive agreement to acquire fibernet for approximately 15 billion in cash subject to certain limited adjustments fibernet is a fiber services provider in florida and texas that owns or has rights to approximately 11500 route miles of fiber installed and under construction inclusive of approximately 6000 route miles in top metro markets we believe that the fibernet assets will further support demand for our wireless infrastructure on january 17 2017 we closed on the fibernet acquisition which was financed using proceeds from our november 2016 equity offering and borrowings under the 2016 revolver

2016  and 2015    

site rental revenues for 2016  grew approximately 2149 million  or 7  from 2015  this increase  was predominately comprised of the factors depicted in the chart below 

  

 towers site rental revenues for 2016  were approximately 28 billion  and increased  by approximately 967 million  or 4  from approximately 27 billion  during 2015  the increase  in towers site rental revenues was impacted by the following items inclusive of straightline accounting in no particular order tenant additions across our entire portfolio renewals or extensions of tenant leases escalations acquisitions including the tdc acquisition in april 2016 and nonrenewals of tenant leases predominately arising from our customers decommissioning of the acquired networks tenant additions were influenced by our customers ongoing efforts to improve network quality and capacity 

small cells site rental revenues for 2016  were approximately 4026 million  and increased  by approximately 1182 million  or 42  from approximately 2844 million  from 2015  the increase  in small cells site rental revenues was predominately 1 impacted by the sunesys acquisition completed in august 2015 and 2 due to the leasing of newly constructed small cells increased demand for small cells was influenced by our customers growing adoption of small cells as an important component of their network strategy to provide capacity and relieve network congestion 

the increase  in towers site rental gross margins from 2015  to 2016  was related to the previously mentioned 4   increase  in towers site rental revenues and relatively fixed costs to operate our towers the increase  in small cells site rental gross margins was predominately related to the previously mentioned 42   increase  in small cells site rental revenues 

towers network services and other gross margin was approximately 2591 million  for 2016  and decreased  by approximately 235 million  or 8  from approximately 2826 million  in 2015  which is a reflection of 1 the volume of activity from carrier network enhancements and 2 the volume and mix of network services and other work our network services and other offerings are of a variable nature as these revenues are not under longterm contracts 

general and administrative expenses for 2016  were approximately 3710 million  and increased  by approximately 601 million  or approximately 19  from approximately 3109 million  during 2015  general and administrative expenses are inclusive of stockbased compensation charges which increased  approximately 294 million  from 2015  to 2016  the increase  in general 

 28 

and administrative expenses was primarily related to the growth in our small cell business as a result of activities such as 1 the sunesys acquisition and 2 the continued expansion in size of our small cell portfolio 

towers operating profit for 2016   increased  by approximately   591 million  or 3  from 2015  towers operating profit was primarily impacted by the growth in our towers site rental revenues and relatively fixed costs to operate our towers 

small cells operating profit for 2016   increased  by approximately 644 million  or 43  from 2015  small cells operating profit was positively impacted by the previously mentioned sunesys acquisition and the leasing of newly constructed small cells 

adjusted ebitda increased  approximately   1083 million  or 5  from 2015  to 2016  adjusted ebitda was 1 positively impacted by the growth in our site rental activities in both towers and small cells and 2 negatively impacted by a decrease in tower network services and other gross margin 

depreciation amortization and accretion was approximately 11 billion  for the 2016  and increased  by approximately 724 million  or 7  from approximately 10 billion  during 2015  this increase predominately resulted from a corresponding increase in our gross property and equipment due to capital expenditures and acquisitions including the sunesys acquisition 

interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs were approximately 5150 million  for 2016  and decreased  by approximately 121 million  or 2  from approximately 5271 million  during 2015  this decrease is predominately the result of a 187 million decrease in the amortization of interest rate swaps 

as a result of repaying certain of our debt in conjunction with our refinancing activities we incurred losses of approximately 523 million  and approximately 42 million  during 2016  and 2015  respectively for a further discussion of the debt refinancings see note 8  to our consolidated financial statements item 7 mda—liquidity and capital resources  and item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

other income expense for 2016  was expenses of approximately 88 million  compared to income of approximately 570 million  for 2015  this change was predominately a result of gains recorded during 2015 on foreign currency swaps that we entered into to manage and reduce our foreign currency risk related to our may 2015 sale of ccal see note 9  to our consolidated financial statements 

the benefit provision for income taxes for 2016  was a provision of approximately 169 million  compared to a benefit of approximately 515 million  for 2015  for 2016  the effective tax rate differs from the federal statutory rate predominately due to our reit status including the dividends paid deduction for 2015  the effective tax rate differed from the federal statutory rate predominately due to 1 our reit status including the dividends paid deduction and 2 the derecognition of net deferred tax liabilities related to the inclusion of small cells in the reit in january 2016 which resulted in a noncash income tax benefit of approximately 338 million  see item 7 mda—accounting and reporting matters—critical accounting policies and estimates  and note 11  to our consolidated financial statements 

income from discontinued operations net of tax decreased from 2015  to 2016  due to the sale of ccal occurring on may 28 2015 in addition during 2015  we recorded a gain on the sale of discontinued operations net of tax of approximately 10 billion 

net income loss attributable to ccic stockholders was income of approximately 3570 million  during 2016  compared to income of approximately 15 billion  during 2015  the decrease  in net income was predominately due to the gain recorded on the sale of ccal in 2015  of approximately 10 billion 

 29 

2015  and 2014    

site rental revenues for 2015  grew approximately 1518 million  or 5  from 2014  this increase  was predominately comprised of the factors depicted in the chart below 

  

 towers site rental revenues for 2015  were approximately 27 billion  and increased  by approximately 561 million  or 2  from 2014  the increase  in towers site rental revenues was impacted by the following items inclusive of straightline accounting in no particular order tenant additions across our entire portfolio renewals or extensions of tenant leases escalations and nonrenewals of tenant leases predominately sprints decommissioning of its legacy nextel iden network tenant additions were influenced by our customers ongoing efforts to improve network quality and capacity 

small cells site rental revenues for 2015  were approximately 2844 million  and increased  by approximately 957 million  or 51  from approximately 1887 million  in 2014  the increase  in small cells site rental revenues was predominately 1 due to the leasing of newly constructed small cells and 2 impacted by the sunesys acquisition demand for small cells was influenced by our customers growing adoption of small cells as an important component of their network strategy to provide capacity and relieve network congestion 

the increase  in towers site rental gross margins from 2014  to 2015  was related to the previously mentioned 2   increase  in towers site rental revenues and relatively fixed costs to operate our towers the increase  in small cells site rental gross margins was predominately related to the previously mentioned 51   increase  in small cells site rental revenues 

towers network services and other gross margin was approximately 2826 million  for 2015  and increased  by approximately 107 million  or 4  from approximately 2719 million  in 2014  which is a reflection of 1 the volume of activity from carrier network enhancements and 2 the volume and mix of network services and other work our network services and other offerings are of a variable nature as these revenues are not under longterm contracts 

general and administrative expenses for 2015   increased  by approximately 536 million  or approximately 21  from 2014  and represented 8  of net revenues in 2015  and 7  of net revenues in 2014  general and administrative expenses are inclusive of stockbased compensation charges the increase  in general and administrative expenses was primarily related to the growth 

 30 

in our business including the expansion in size of our wireless infrastructure portfolio primarily due to acquisitions and growth in small cells 

towers operating profit for 2015   increased  by approximately 406 million  or 2  from 2014  towers operating profit was primarily impacted by the growth in our towers site rental revenues and relatively fixed costs to operate our towers 

small cells operating profit for 2015   increased  by approximately 472 million  or 46  from 2014  small cells operating profit was positively impacted by the previously mentioned sunesys acquisition and due to the leasing of newly constructed small cells 

adjusted ebitda increased by approximately 679 million  or 3 from 2014  to 2015  adjusted ebitda was positively impacted by the growth in our site rental activities partially offset by the aforementioned increase in general and administrative expenses 

depreciation amortization and accretion for 2015   increased  by approximately 504 million  or 5  from 2014  this increase  predominately resulted from capital expenditures and acquisitions including the sunesys acquisition 

interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs decreased  by approximately 462 million  or 8  from 2014  to 2015  primarily as a result of a 444 million decrease in the amortization of previously settled interest rate swaps 

as a result of repaying and redeeming certain of our debt we incurred net losses of approximately 42 million  and approximately 446 million  for 2015  and 2014  respectively for a further discussion of the debt refinancings see note 8  to our consolidated financial statements item 7 mda—liquidity and capital resources  and item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

our acquisition and integration expenses for 2014  were approximately 341 million  and were related to our 2012 and 2013 acquisitions see note 4  to our consolidated financial statements 

other income expense for 2015  was income of approximately 570 million  compared to income of approximately 120 million  for 2014  this change was predominately a result of gains recorded during 2015 on foreign currency swaps that we entered into to manage and reduce our foreign currency risk related to our may 2015 sale of ccal see note 9  to our consolidated financial statements 

the benefit provision for income taxes for 2015  was a benefit of approximately 515 million  compared to a benefit of approximately 112 million  for 2014  for 2015  the effective tax rate differed from the federal statutory rate predominately due to 1 our reit status including the dividends paid deduction and 2 the derecognition of net deferred tax liabilities related to the inclusion of small cells in the reit in january 2016 which resulted in a noncash income tax benefit of approximately 338 million  for 2014  the effective tax rate differed from the federal statutory rate predominately due to our reit status including the dividends paid deduction see item 7 mda—accounting and reporting matters—critical accounting policies and estimates  and note 11  to our consolidated financial statements 

income from discontinued operations net of tax decreased from 2014  to 2015  due to the sale of ccal occurring midperiod on may 28 2015 in addition during 2015  we recorded a gain on the sale of discontinued operations net of tax of approximately 10 billion 

net income loss attributable to ccic stockholders for 2015  was income of approximately 15 billion  compared to income of approximately 3905 million  for 2014  the increase  in net income was predominately due to the gain recorded on the sale of ccal of approximately 10 billion 

liquidity and capital resources 

overview 

general  our core business generates revenues under longterm leases see item 7 mda—general overview—overview  predominately from the largest us wireless carriers our strategy is to create longterm stockholder value via a combination of 1 growing cash flows generated from our portfolio of wireless infrastructure 2 returning a meaningful portion of our cash provided by operating activities to our stockholders in the form of dividends and 3 investing capital efficiently to grow cash flows and longterm dividends per share we measure our efforts to create longterm stockholder value by the combined payment of dividends to stockholders and growth in our per share results see item 1 business—strategy  for a further discussion of our strategy 

 31 

we have and expect to continue to engage in discretionary investments that we believe will maximize longterm stockholder value our historical discretionary investments include in no particular order purchasing our common stock acquiring or constructing wireless infrastructure acquiring land interests under towers improving and structurally enhancing our existing wireless infrastructure and purchasing repaying or redeeming our debt we have recently spent and expect to continue to spend a significant percentage of our discretionary investments on the construction of new small cell networks we seek to fund our discretionary investments with both net cash provided by operating activities and cash available from financing capacity such as the use of our undrawn availability from the 2016 revolver debt financings and issuances of equity or equity related securities including under our atm program 

we seek to maintain a capital structure that we believe drives longterm stockholder value and optimizes our weightedaverage cost of capital we target a leverage ratio of approximately four to five times adjusted ebitda and interest coverage of approximately three times adjusted ebitda subject to various factors such as the availability and cost of capital and the potential longterm return on our discretionary investments we may choose to increase or decrease our leverage or coverage from these targets for various periods of time 

we operate as a reit for us federal income tax purposes we expect to continue to pay minimal cash income taxes as a result of our reit status and our nols see item 1 business—2016 industry highlights and company developments—reit status item 7 mda—general overview  and note 11  to our consolidated financial statements

summary cash flows information   



operating activities 

the decrease in net cash provided by operating activities for 2016  from 2015  was due primarily to a net decrease in working capital partially offset by growth in our core business the increase in net cash provided by operating activities for 2015  from 2014  was due primarily to growth in our core business including a net benefit from changes in working capital changes in working capital including changes in accounts receivable deferred site rental receivables deferred rental revenues prepaid ground leases restricted cash and accrued interest can have a significant impact on net cash provided by operating activities largely due to the timing of prepayments and receipts we expect to grow our net cash provided by operating activities in the future exclusive of movements in working capital if we realize expected growth in our core business 

investing activities 

capital expenditures 

our capital expenditures are categorized as discretionary or sustaining as described below 



 33 

a summary of our capital expenditures for the last three years is as follows in thousands of dollars   

capital expenditures decreased from 2015 to 2016  and were impacted by 1 the construction of small cell networks to address our customers growing demand for small cell networks 2 lower amounts of improvements to existing towers and 3 lower sustaining capital expenditures in 2016 due to expansion of office facilities in 2015 our sustaining capital expenditures have historically been less than 2 of net revenues annually and were approximately 3 of net revenues in 2015 due to expansion of our office facilities see item 7 mda—general overview—outlook highlights  for a discussion of our expectations surrounding 2017  capital expenditures

 the following chart summarizes our rights to the land interests under our towers including renewal terms at our option as of december 31 2016  as of december 31 2016  the leases for land interests under our towers had an average remaining life in excess of 30  years weighted based on towers site rental gross margin see item 1a risk factors   

  



 37 

debt covenants 

the credit agreement governing the 2016 credit facility contains financial maintenance covenants we are currently in compliance with these financial maintenance covenants and based upon our current expectations we believe we will continue to comply with these financial maintenance covenants in addition certain of our debt agreements also contain restrictive covenants that place restrictions on us and may limit our ability to among other things incur additional debt and liens purchase our securities make capital expenditures dispose of assets undertake transactions with affiliates make other investments pay dividends or distribute excess cash flow see note 8  to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our debt covenants see item 1a risk factors the following are ratios applicable to the financial maintenance covenants under the credit agreement governing our 2016 credit facility as of december 31 2016

accounting and reporting matters 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the following is a discussion of the accounting policies and estimates that we believe 1 are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations or 2 require our most difficult subjective or complex judgments often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain the critical accounting policies and estimates for 2016  are not intended to be a comprehensive list of our accounting policies and estimates see note 2  to our consolidated financial statements for a summary of our significant accounting policies in many cases the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by gaap in other cases management is required to exercise judgment in the application of accounting principles with respect to particular transactions 

revenue recognition   82  of our total revenue for 2016  consists of site rental revenues which are recognized on a monthly basis over the fixed noncancelable term of the relevant lease generally ranging from five to 15 years regardless of whether the payments from the tenant are received in equal monthly amounts if the payment terms call for fixed escalations as in fixed dollar or fixed percentage increases upfront payments or rent free periods the revenue is recognized on a straightline basis over the fixed noncancelable term of the lease when calculating our straightline rental revenues we consider all fixed elements of tenant contractual escalation provisions even if such escalation provisions contain a variable element such as an escalator tied to an inflationbased index in addition to a minimum to the extent we acquire belowmarket tenant leases for contractual interests with tenants on the acquired wireless infrastructure for example with respect to small cells we record deferred credits and amortize such deferred credits to site rental revenues over their estimated lease term since we recognize revenue on a straightline basis a portion of the site rental revenue in a given period represents cash collected or contractually collectible in other periods our assets related to straightline site rental revenues are included in other current assets and deferred site rental receivables net amounts billed or received prior to being earned are deferred and reflected in deferred revenues and other longterm liabilities see notes 2  and 7  to our consolidated financial statements 

as part of our effort to provide comprehensive wireless infrastructure solutions we also offer certain network services relating to our wireless infrastructure which represent approximately 18  of our total revenues for 2016  network services and other revenue consists of 1 site development services and 2 installation services network services revenues are recognized after completion of the applicable service we account for network services separately from the customers site rental see item 1 business—the company  for a further discussion of our business 

 38 

accounting for acquisitions — general as described in  item 1 business  much of our wireless infrastructure has been acquired in various transactions from the four largest wireless carriers or their predecessors through transactions consummated since 1999 we evaluate each of our acquisitions to determine if it should be accounted for as a business combination or as an acquisition of assets for our business combinations we allocate the purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair value at the date of acquisition any purchase price in excess of the net fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is allocated to goodwill see item 7 mda—accounting and reporting matters—accounting for acquisitions—valuation below 

the determination of the final purchase price allocation could extend over several quarters resulting in the use of preliminary estimates that are subject to adjustment until finalized such changes could have a significant impact on our financial statements 

accounting for acquisitions — leases with respect to business combinations that include towers that we lease and operate such as the att tmobile and sprint leased and subleased towers we evaluate such agreements to determine treatment as capital or operating leases the evaluation of such agreements for capital or operating lease treatment includes consideration of each of the lease classification criteria under asc 8401025 namely 1 the transfer of ownership provisions 2 the existence of bargain purchase options 3 the length of the remaining lease term and 4 the present value of the minimum lease payments with respect to the att acquisition tmobile acquisition and the sprint towers acquired in the global signal acquisition we determined that the tower leases were capital leases and the underlying land leases were operating leases based upon the lease term criterion after considering the fragmentation criteria applicable under asc 8401025 to leases involving both land and buildings ie towers we determined that the fragmentation criteria was met and the tower leases could be accounted for as capital leases apart from the land leases which are accounted for as operating leases since 1 the fair value of the land in the aforementioned business combinations was greater than 25 of the total fair value of the leased property at inception and 2 the tower lease expirations occur beyond 75 of the estimated economic life of the tower assets 

accounting for acquisitions — valuation  as of december 31 2016  our largest asset was property and equipment which primarily consists of wireless infrastructure followed by goodwill and intangible assets our identifiable intangible assets predominately relate to the site rental contracts and customer relationships intangible assets see note 2  to our consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the nature and composition of the site rental contracts and customer relationships intangible assets 

the fair value of the vast majority of our assets and liabilities is determined by using either 

 the purchase price allocation requires subjective estimates that if incorrectly estimated could be material to our consolidated financial statements including the amount of depreciation amortization and accretion expense the most important estimates for measurement of tangible fixed assets are 1 the cost to replace the asset with a new asset and 2 the economic useful life after giving effect to age quality and condition the most important estimates for measurement of intangible assets are 1 discount rates and 2 timing and amount of cash flows including estimates regarding customer renewals and cancellations the most important estimates for measurement of above and belowmarket leases is the determination of 1 favorability or unfavorability to the current market terms and 2 applicable lease term including whether renewals or extensions should be measured with respect to business combinations that include towers that we lease and operate such as the tmobile sprint and att leased and subleased towers we evaluate such agreements to determine treatment as capital or operating leases and identification of any bargain purchase options 

we record the fair value of obligations to perform certain asset retirement activities including requirements pursuant to our ground leases or easements to remove wireless infrastructure or remediate the land upon which our wireless infrastructure resides in determining the fair value of these asset retirement obligations we must make several subjective and highly judgmental estimates such as those related to 1 timing of cash flows 2 future costs 3 discount rates and 4 the probability of enforcement to remove the towers or small cells or remediate the land see note 2  to our consolidated financial statements 

accounting for longlived assets — useful lives  we are required to make subjective assessments as to the useful lives of our tangible and intangible assets for purposes of determining depreciation amortization and accretion expense that if incorrectly estimated could be material to our consolidated financial statements depreciation expense for our property and equipment is computed using the straightline method over the estimated useful lives of our various classes of tangible assets the substantial portion of our property and equipment represents the cost of our wireless infrastructure which is depreciated with an estimated useful life equal to the shorter of 1 20 years or 2 the term of the lease including optional renewals for the land interests under the wireless infrastructure 

 39 

the useful life of our intangible assets is estimated based on the period over which the intangible asset is expected to benefit us and gives consideration to the expected useful life of other assets to which the useful life may relate we review the expected useful lives of our intangible assets on an ongoing basis and adjust if necessary amortization expense for intangible assets is computed using the straightline method over the estimated useful life of each of the intangible assets the useful life of the site rental contracts and customer relationships intangible assets is limited by the maximum depreciable life of the wireless infrastructure 20 years as a result of the interdependency of the wireless infrastructure and site rental contracts and customer relationships in contrast the site rental contracts and customer relationships are estimated to provide economic benefits for several decades because of the low rate of tenant cancellations and high rate of renewals experienced to date thus while site rental contracts and customer relationships are valued based upon the fair value of the site rental contracts and customer relationships which includes assumptions regarding both 1 tenants exercise of optional renewals contained in the acquired leases and 2 renewals of the acquired leases past the contractual term including exercisable options the site rental contracts are amortized over a period not to exceed 20 years as a result of the useful life being limited by the depreciable life of the wireless infrastructure 

accounting for longlived assets — impairment evaluation — intangibles  we review the carrying values of property and equipment intangible assets or other longlived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable we utilize the following dual grouping policy for purposes of determining the unit of account for testing impairment of the site rental contracts and customer relationships 

 we first pool site rental contracts and customer relationships intangible assets and property and equipment into portfolio groups for purposes of determining the unit of account for impairment testing because we view wireless infrastructure as portfolios and wireless infrastructure in a given portfolio and its related tenant leases are not largely independent of the other wireless infrastructure in the portfolio we reevaluate the appropriateness of the pooled groups at least annually this use of grouping is based in part on 1 our limitations regarding disposal of wireless infrastructure 2 the interdependencies of wireless infrastructure portfolios and 3 the manner in which wireless infrastructure is traded in the marketplace the vast majority of our site rental contracts and customer relationships intangible assets and property and equipment are pooled into the us owned wireless infrastructure group secondly and separately we pool site rental contracts and customer relationships by significant tenant or by tenant grouping for individually insignificant tenants as appropriate for purposes of determining the unit of account for impairment testing because we associate the value ascribed to site rental contracts and customer relationships intangible assets to the underlying contracts and related customer relationships acquired 

our determination that an adverse event or change in circumstance has occurred that indicates that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable will generally involve 1 a deterioration in an assets financial performance compared to historical results 2 a shortfall in an assets financial performance compared to forecasted results or 3 changes affecting the utility and estimated future demands for the asset when considering the utility of our assets we consider events that would meaningfully impact 1 our wireless infrastructure or 2 our customer relationships for example consideration would be given to events that impact 1 the structural integrity and longevity of our wireless infrastructure or 2 our ability to derive benefit from our existing customer relationships including events such as bankruptcy or insolvency or loss of a significant customer during 2016  there were no events or circumstances that caused us to review the carrying value of our intangible assets or property and equipment due in part to our assets performing consistently with or better than our expectations 

if the sum of the estimated future cash flows undiscounted from an asset or portfolio group significant tenant or tenant group for individually insignificant tenants as applicable is less than its carrying amount an impairment loss may be recognized if the carrying value were to exceed the undiscounted cash flows measurement of an impairment loss would be based on the fair value of the asset which is based on an estimate of discounted future cash flows the most important estimates for such calculations of undiscounted cash flows are 1 the expected additions of new tenants and equipment on our wireless infrastructure and 2 estimates regarding tenant cancellations and renewals of leases we could record impairments in the future if changes in longterm market conditions expected future operating results or the utility of the assets results in changes for our impairment test calculations which negatively impact the fair value of our property and equipment and intangible assets or if we changed our unit of account in the future

when grouping assets into pools for purposes of impairment evaluation we also consider individual towers nodes and third party land interests within a grouping for which we currently have no tenants approximately 3  of our total towers currently have no tenants we continue to pay operating expenses on these towers in anticipation of obtaining tenants on these towers in the future primarily because of the individual tower site demographics we estimate based on current visibility potential tenants on approximately half of these towers to the extent we do not believe there are longterm prospects of obtaining tenants on an individual tower node or third party land interest and all other possible avenues for recovering the carrying value has been exhausted including sale of the asset we appropriately reduce the carrying value of such assets to fair value 

accounting for longlived assets — impairment evaluation — goodwill  we test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis regardless of whether adverse events or changes in circumstances have occurred the annual test begins with goodwill and all intangible assets being allocated to applicable reporting units we then perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount if it is concluded that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount it is necessary to perform the twostep goodwill impairment test otherwise the twostep goodwill impairment test is not required our reporting units are the same as our operating segments towers and small cells see note 16 we performed our most recent annual goodwill impairment test as of october 1 2016  which resulted in no impairments this assessment included consideration of our market capitalization which was approximately four times the aggregate carrying amount of the reporting units as of december 31 2016  

deferred income taxes  we operate as a reit for us federal income tax purposes our reit taxable income is generally not subject to federal and state income taxes as a result of the deduction for dividends paid and any usage of our remaining nols accordingly the only provision or benefit for federal income taxes for the year ended december 31 2016  relates to trss furthermore as a result of the deduction for dividends paid some or all of our nols related to our reit may expire without utilization see  item 1 business— 2016  industry highlights and company developments—reit status  for a discussion of the impact of our reit status 

our trss will continue to be subject as applicable to federal and state income taxes and foreign taxes in the jurisdictions in which such assets and operations are located see  item 1 business— 2016  industry highlights and company developments—reit status  for a discussion of our inclusion of small cells in the reit effective january 4 2016 our ability to utilize our nols is dependent in part upon our having sufficient future earnings to utilize our nols before they expire if market conditions change materially and we determine that we will be unable to generate sufficient taxable income in the future to utilize our nols we would be required to record an additional valuation allowance which would reduce our earnings such adjustments could cause a material effect on our results of operations for the period of the adjustment the change in our valuation allowance has no effect on our cash flows for a further discussion of our benefit provision for income taxes and our reit conversion see item 7 mda—results of operations  and note 11  to our consolidated financial statements

nongaap and segment financial measures 

in addition to the nongaap measures used herein and as discussed in note 16  to our consolidated financial statements we also provide 1 segment site rental gross margin 2 segment network services and other gross margin and 3 segment operating profit which are key measures used by management to evaluate our operating segments for purposes of making decisions about allocating capital and assessing performance these segment measures are provided pursuant to gaap requirements related to segment reporting 

we define segment site rental gross margin as segment site rental revenues less segment site rental cost of operations which excludes stockbased compensation expense and prepaid lease purchase price adjustments recorded in consolidated cost of operations we define segment network services and other gross margin as segment network services and other revenues less segment network services and other cost of operations which excludes stockbased compensation expense recorded in consolidated cost of operations we define segment operating profit as segment site rental gross margin plus segment network services and other gross margin less general and administrative expenses attributable to the respective segment 

we use earnings before interest taxes depreciation amortization and accretion as adjusted adjusted ebitda which is a nongaap measure as an indicator of consolidated financial performance our measure of adjusted ebitda may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies including companies in the wireless infrastructure sector or other reits and is not a measure of performance calculated in accordance with gaap adjusted ebitda should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for operating income or loss net income or loss net cash provided by used for operating investing 

 41 

and financing activities or other income statement or cash flow statement data prepared in accordance with gaap and should be considered only as a supplement to net income or loss computed in accordance with gaap as a measure of our performance there are material limitations to using a measure such as adjusted ebitda including the difficulty associated with comparing results among more than one company including our competitors and the inability to analyze certain significant items including depreciation and interest expense that directly affect our net income or loss management compensates for these limitations by considering the economic effect of the excluded expense items independently as well as in connection with their analysis of net income loss 

we define adjusted ebitda as net income loss plus restructuring charges credits asset writedown charges acquisition and integration costs depreciation amortization and accretion amortization of prepaid lease purchase price adjustments interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs gains losses on retirement of longterm obligations net gain loss on interest rate swaps gains losses on foreign currency swaps impairment of availableforsale securities interest income other income expense benefit provision for income taxes cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle income loss from discontinued operations and stockbased compensation expense the reconciliation of adjusted ebitda to our net income loss is set forth below and excludes items in the companys adjusted ebitda definition which are not applicable to the periods shown 



  

 we believe adjusted ebitda is useful to investors or other interested parties in evaluating our financial performance because 

 our management uses adjusted ebitda

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

our primary exposures to market risks are related to changes in interest rates which may adversely affect our results of operations and financial position we seek to manage exposure to changes in interest rates where economically prudent to do so by utilizing fixed rate debt 

our interest rate risk relates primarily to the impact of interest rate movements on the following after giving effect to 1 the fibernet acquisition and 2 the 2017 refinancings 

 potential refinancing of existing debt 

over the next 12 months we have no debt maturities other than principal payments on amortizing debt we have no debt maturities that have anticipated repayment dates during 2017  as of december 31 2016  and december 31 2015  we had no interest rate swaps hedging any refinancings see below for a tabular presentation of our scheduled contractual debt maturities as of december 31 2016  after giving effect to 1 the fibernet acquisition and 2 the 2017 refinancings and a discussion of anticipated repayment dates 

floating rate debt 

we manage our exposure to market interest rates on our existing debt by controlling the mix of fixed and floating rate debt as of december 31 2016  after giving effect to 1 the fibernet acquisition and 2 the 2017 refinancings we had 25 billion of floating rate debt none of which had libor floors as a result a hypothetical unfavorable fluctuation in market interest rates on our existing debt of 18 of a percent point over a 12month period would increase our interest expense by approximately 31 million as of december 31 2015  we had approximately 40 billion of floating rate debt none of which had libor floors 

potential future borrowings of incremental debt 

we typically do not hedge our exposure to interest rates on potential future borrowings of incremental debt for a substantial period prior to issuance see item 7 mda—liquidity and capital resources  regarding our liquidity strategy 

 43 

the following table provides information about our market risk related to changes in interest rates the future principal payments and weightedaverage interest rates are presented as of december 31 2016  after giving effect to 1 the fibernet acquisition and 2 the 2017 refinancings see note 19 to our consolidated financial statements these debt maturities reflect contractual maturity dates and do not consider the impact of the principal payments that will commence following the anticipated repayment dates of certain notes see footnotes c and d see note 8  to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our debt

 item 1 business 

overview 

we own operate and lease shared wireless infrastructure including 1 towers and other structures such as rooftops collectively towers and 2 small cell networks supported by fiber collectively small cells and together with towers wireless infrastructure our core business is providing access including space or capacity to our shared wireless infrastructure via longterm contracts in various forms including license sublease and lease agreements collectively leases we seek to increase our site rental revenues by adding more tenants on our shared wireless infrastructure which we expect to result in significant incremental cash flows due to our relatively fixed operating costs 

effective january 1 2014 we commenced operating as a reit for us federal income tax purposes see item 1 business— industry highlights and company developments —reit election 

certain information concerning our business as of december 31 2015  is as follows 

 certain information concerning our customers and site rental leases as of and for the year ended december 31 2015  is as follows 

 as part of our effort to provide comprehensive wireless infrastructure solutions we offer certain network services relating to our wireless infrastructure consisting of 1 the following site development services relating to existing or new tenant equipment installations on our wireless infrastructure site acquisition architectural and engineering or zoning and permitting collectively site development services and 2 tenant equipment installation or subsequent augmentations collectively installation services 

strategy 

our strategy is to create longterm stockholder value via a combination of 1 growing cash flows generated from our portfolio of wireless infrastructure 2 returning a meaningful portion of our cash provided by operating activities to our stockholders in the form of dividends and 3 investing capital efficiently to grow cash flows and longterm dividends per share we measure our efforts to create longterm stockholder value by the combined payment of dividends to stockholders and growth in our per share results the key elements of our strategy are to 

 1 

 our strategy to create longterm stockholder value is based on our belief that additional demand for our wireless infrastructure will be created by the expected continued growth in demand for wireless connectivity we believe that such demand for our wireless infrastructure will continue will result in growth of our cash flows due to tenant additions on our existing wireless infrastructure and will create other growth opportunities for us such as demand for new wireless infrastructure 

2015  industry highlights and company developments 

see item 1 business—overview item 1 business—the company item 7 mda  and our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of certain recent developments and activities including 1 the increase in our quarterly common stock dividend 2 our may 2015 sale of our formerly 776 owned australian subsidiary ccal 3 our august 2015 acquisition of quanta fiber networks inc sunesys acquisition and 4 our recent financing activities 

reit election  we commenced operating as a reit for us federal income tax purposes effective january 1 2014 as a reit we are generally entitled to a deduction for dividends that we pay and therefore are not subject to us federal corporate income tax on our net taxable income that is currently distributed to our stockholders we also may be subject to certain federal state local and foreign taxes on our income or assets including 1 alternative minimum taxes 2 taxes on any undistributed income 3 taxes related to our  taxable reit subsidiaries  trss 4 certain state local or foreign income taxes 5 franchise taxes 6 property taxes and 7 transfer taxes in addition we could in certain circumstances be required to pay an excise or penalty tax which could be significant in amount in order to utilize one or more relief provisions under the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended code to maintain qualification for taxation as a reit 

in august 2014 we received a favorable private letter ruling from the internal revenue service irs which provides that the real property portion of our small cells and the related rents qualify as real property and rents from real property respectively under the rules governing reits during the fourth quarter of 2015 we completed the necessary steps to include our small cells that were previously included in one or more whollyowned trss in the reit effective january 2016  

substantially all of our revenues are in the reit additionally we have included in trss certain other assets and operations those trs assets and operations will continue to be subject as applicable to federal and state corporate income taxes or to foreign taxes in the jurisdictions in which such assets and operations are located our foreign assets and operations including our tower operations in puerto rico most likely will be subject to foreign income taxes in the jurisdictions in which such assets and operations are located regardless of whether they are included in a trs or not 

 2 

to remain qualified and be taxed as a reit we will generally be required to distribute at least 90 of our reit taxable income after the utilization of our nols determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding net capital gain each year to our stockholders see notes 2  and 11  to our consolidated financial statements our quarterly common stock dividend will delay the utilization of our nols and may cause certain of the nols to expire without utilization 

wireless industry update during 2015  consumer demand for wireless connectivity continued to grow due to increases in wireless data consumption and increased penetration of bandwidth intensive devices this growth in wireless consumption is driven by the increased usage of wireless applications including 1 mobile entertainment such as mobile video mobile applications and social networking 2 mobile internet usage such as email and web browsing and 3 machinetomachine applications also known as the internet of things as a result consumer wireless devices are trending toward bandwidthintensive devices such as smartphones laptops tablets and other emerging devices 

the major wireless carriers continue to upgrade and enhance their networks which has translated into additional demand for our wireless infrastructure we expect that consumers growing wireless consumption will likely result in wireless carriers continuing to invest in their networks and focus on improving network quality and capacity by adding additional antennas or other equipment for the transmission of their services to wireless infrastructure in an effort to improve customer retention or satisfaction additionally spectrum licensed by the federal communications commission fcc has enabled continued wireless carrier network development we expect this development and the potential availability of additional spectrum through government auctions to enable continued future carrier network development and potential demand for our wireless infrastructure 

the company 

following the sale of ccal in may 2015 virtually all of our operations are located in the us we conduct substantially all of our operations through subsidiaries of crown castle operating company ccoc for more information about our operating segment see note 16  to our consolidated financial statements and item 7 mda    

site rental  our core business is providing access including space or capacity to our shared wireless infrastructure in the us which predominately consists of towers and small cells we predominately provide access to wireless carriers under longterm leases for their antennas which transmit a variety of signals related to wireless connectivity our small cells are primarily located outdoors to a lesser extent we offer fiber solutions including dark fiber and lit fiber we believe our wireless infrastructure is integral to our customers networks and their ability to serve their customers 

we acquired ownership interests or exclusive rights to the majority of our towers from the four largest wireless carriers or their predecessors through transactions consummated since 1999 including transactions with 1 att in 2013 att acquisition 2 tmobile in 2012 tmobile acquisition 3 global signal inc in 2007 global signal acquisition  which had originally acquired the majority of its towers from sprint 4 companies now part of verizon wireless during 1999 and 2000 and 5 companies now part of att during 1999 and 2000 our small cell assets include those acquired from nextg networks inc in 2012 nextg acquisition and the sunesys acquisition in 2015 

we generally receive monthly rental payments from tenants payable under longterm leases we have existing master lease agreements with most wireless carriers including att tmobile verizon wireless and sprint such agreements provide certain terms including economic terms that govern leases on our wireless infrastructure entered into by such carriers during the term of their master lease agreements we generally negotiate initial contract terms of five to 15 years with multiple renewal periods at the option of the tenant of five to ten years each and our leases typically include fixed escalations we continue to endeavor to negotiate with our existing customer base for longer contractual terms which often contain fixed escalation rates 

our tenant leases have historically had a high renewal rate with limited exceptions our tenant leases may not be terminated prior to the end of their current term and nonrenewals have averaged approximately 2 of site rental revenues over the last five years see item 1a risk factors  regarding future anticipated nonrenewals as a result of the decommissioning at least in part of the former leap wireless metropcs and clearwire networks acquired networks in general each tenant lease which is renewable will automatically renew at the end of its term unless the tenant provides prior notice of its intent not to renew see note 15  to our consolidated financial statements for a tabular presentation of the minimum rental cash payments due to us by tenants pursuant to tenant agreements without consideration of tenant renewal options 

the average monthly rental payment of a new tenant added to wireless infrastructure can vary based on 1 aggregate tenant volume 2 the different regions in the us or 3 the physical size weight and shape of the antenna installation and related equipment with respect to our small cells the amount of the monthly payments can also be influenced by similar factors as well as the amount or cost of 1 construction for initial and subsequent tenants 2 fiber strands 3 equipment at the site or 4 any upfront payments received we also routinely receive rental payment increases in connection with lease amendments pursuant to which our tenants add additional antennas or other equipment to wireless infrastructure on which they already have equipment pursuant to preexisting leases 

 3 

in excess of twothirds  of our direct site operating expenses consist of lease expenses and the remainder includes property taxes repairs and maintenance employee compensation or related benefit costs or utilities our cash operating expenses tend to escalate at approximately the rate of inflation partially offset by reductions in cash lease expenses from our purchases of land interests as a result of the relatively fixed nature of these expenditures the addition of new tenants is achieved at a low incremental operating cost resulting in high incremental operating cash flows our wireless infrastructure portfolio requires minimal sustaining capital expenditures including maintenance or other nondiscretionary capital expenditures and are typically approximately 2  of net revenues see note 15  to our consolidated financial statements for a tabular presentation of the rental cash payments owed by us to landlords pursuant to our contractual agreements 

network services  as part of our effort to provide comprehensive solutions we offer certain network services relating to our wireless infrastructure predominately consisting of 1 site development services and 2 installation services for 2015  65  of our network services and other revenues related to installation services and the remainder predominately related to site development services we have grown our network service revenues over the last several years as a result of increased volumes resulting from carrier network upgrades promoting site development services expanding the scope of our services and our focus on customer service and deployment speed we have the capability and expertise to install with the assistance of our network of subcontractors equipment or antenna systems for our customers we do not always provide the installation services or site development services for our customers on our wireless infrastructure as third parties also provide these services see also —competition below these activities are typically nonrecurring and highly competitive with a number of local competitors in most markets typically our installation services are billed on a costplus profit basis and site development services are billed on a fixed fee basis 

customers  we work extensively with large national wireless carriers and in general our customers are primarily comprised of providers of wireless connectivity that operate national or regional networks our four largest customers att tmobile verizon wireless and sprint collectively accounted for 90  of our 2015  site rental revenues see item 1a risk factors  and note 16  to our consolidated financial statements 

sales and marketing  our sales organization markets our wireless infrastructure within the wireless industry with the objective of providing access to existing wireless infrastructure or to new wireless infrastructure prior to construction we seek to become the critical partner and preferred independent wireless infrastructure provider for our customers and increase customer satisfaction relative to our peers by leveraging our 1 customer relationships 2 processcentric approach and 3 technological tools 

a team of national account directors maintains our relationships with our largest customers these directors work to develop wireless infrastructure leasing as well as to ensure that customers wireless infrastructure needs are efficiently translated into new leases on our wireless infrastructure sales personnel in our area offices develop and maintain local relationships with our customers that are expanding their networks entering new markets bringing new technologies to market or requiring maintenance or addon business in addition to our fulltime sales or marketing staff a number of senior managers and officers spend a significant portion of their time on sales and marketing activities and call on existing or prospective customers 

competition  we face competition for site rental tenants from various sources including 1 other independent wireless infrastructure owners or operators including towers rooftops broadcast towers utility poles fiber providers distributed antenna systems das or other small cells or 2 new alternative deployment methods in the wireless industry 

some of the larger independent tower companies with which we compete include american tower corporation and sba communications corporation we believe that tower location deployment speed quality of service capacity and price have been and will continue to be the most significant competitive factors affecting the leasing of wireless infrastructure see item 1a risk factors 

competitors in our network services offering include site acquisition consultants zoning consultants real estate firms rightofway consulting firms construction companies tower owners or managers radio frequency engineering consultants telecommunications equipment vendors who can provide turnkey site development services through multiple subcontractors or our customers internal staff we believe that our customers base their decisions on the outsourcing of network services on criteria such as a companys experience track record local reputation price or time for completion of a project 

sale of ccal on may 28 2015 we completed the sale of our formerly 776 owned australian subsidiary ccal to a consortium of investors led by macquarie infrastructure and real assets at closing we received net proceeds of approximately 11 billion after accounting for our ownership interest repayment of intercompany debt owed to us by ccal and estimated transaction fees and expenses exclusive of the impact of foreign currency swaps related to the ccal sale 

ccal had historically been a separate operating segment the sale of our ccal operating segment is treated as discontinued operations for all periods presented and represents a strategic shift for us to focus on us operations see note 3  to our consolidated financial statements

employees 

at january 31 2016  we employed approximately 2700 people we are not a party to any collective bargaining agreements we have not experienced any strikes or work stoppages and management believes that our employee relations are satisfactory 

regulatory and environmental matters 

we are required to comply with a variety of federal state and local regulations and laws in the us including fcc and federal aviation administration faa regulations and those discussed under —environmental  below to date we have not incurred any material fines or penalties or experienced any material adverse effects to our business as a result of any domestic or international regulations the summary below is based on regulations currently in effect and such regulations are subject to review or modification by the applicable governmental authority from time to time if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations we may be fined or even lose our rights to conduct some of our business 

federal regulations  both the fcc and the faa regulate towers used for wireless communications radio or television broadcasting such regulations control the siting lighting or marking of towers and may depending on the characteristics of particular towers require the registration of tower facilities with the fcc and the issuance of determinations confirming no hazard to air traffic wireless communications devices operating on towers are separately regulated and independently licensed based upon the particular frequency used in addition the fcc and the faa have developed standards to consider proposals for new or modified tower or antenna structures based upon the height or location including proximity to airports proposals to construct or to modify existing tower or antenna structures above certain heights are reviewed by the faa to ensure the structure will not present a hazard to aviation which determination may be conditioned upon compliance with lighting or marking requirements the fcc requires its licensees to operate communications devices only on towers that comply with faa rules and are registered with the fcc if required by its regulations where tower lighting is required by faa regulation tower owners bear the responsibility of notifying the faa of any tower lighting outage and ensuring the timely restoration of such outages failure to comply with the applicable requirements may lead to civil penalties 

local regulations  the us telecommunications act of 1996 amended the communications act of 1934 to preserve state and local zoning authorities jurisdiction over the siting of communications towers and small cells the law however limits local zoning authority by prohibiting actions by local authorities that discriminate between different service providers of wireless communications or ban altogether the provision of wireless communications additionally the law prohibits state and local restrictions based on the environmental effects of radio frequency emissions to the extent the facilities comply with fcc regulations 

local regulations include city and other local ordinances including subdivision and zoning ordinances approvals for construction modification and removal of towers and small cells and restrictive covenants imposed by community developers these regulations vary greatly but typically require us to obtain approval from local officials prior to tower construction local zoning authorities may render decisions that prevent the construction or modification of towers or place conditions on such construction or modifications that are responsive to community residents concerns regarding the height visibility or other characteristics of the towers over the last several years there have been several developments related to fcc regulations and legislation that assist in expediting and streamlining the deployment of wireless networks including establishing timeframes for reviews by local and state governments notwithstanding such legislative and fcc actions decisions of local zoning authorities may also adversely affect the timing or cost of wireless infrastructure construction or modification 

some of our small cell related subsidiaries hold authorization to provide intrastate telecommunication services as competitive local exchange carriers clec in numerous states and to provide domestic interstate telecommunication services as authorized by the fcc these small cell subsidiaries are primarily regulated by state public service commissions which have jurisdiction over public rightsofway clec status in certain cases helps promote access to such public rightsofway which is beneficial to the deployment of our small cells on a timely basis status as a clec often allows us to deploy our small cells in locations where zoning restrictions might otherwise delay restrict or prevent building or expanding traditional wireless tower sites or traditional wireless rooftop sites see item 1a risk factors 

environmental we are required to comply with a variety of federal state and local environmental laws and regulations protecting environmental quality including air and water quality and wildlife protection to date we have not incurred any material fines or penalties or experienced any material adverse effects to our business as a result of any domestic or international environmental regulations or matters see item 1a risk factors 

the construction of new towers or in some cases the modification of existing towers in the us may be subject to environmental review under the national environmental policy act of 1969 as amended nepa which requires federal agencies to evaluate the environmental impact of major federal actions the fcc has promulgated regulations implementing nepa which require applicants to investigate the potential environmental impact of the proposed tower construction should the proposed tower construction present a significant environmental impact the fcc must prepare an environmental impact statement subject 

 5 

to public comment if the proposed construction or modification of a tower may have a significant impact on the environment the fccs approval of the construction or modification could be significantly delayed 

our operations are subject to federal state and local laws and regulations relating to the management use storage disposal emission or remediation of or exposure to hazardous or nonhazardous substances materials or wastes as an owner lessee or operator of real property we are subject to certain environmental laws that impose strict jointandseveral liability for the cleanup of onsite or offsite contamination relating to existing or historical operations or we could also be subject to personal injury or property damage claims relating to such contamination in general our customer contracts prohibit our customers from using or storing any hazardous substances on our tower sites in violation of applicable environmental laws and require our customers to provide notice of certain environmental conditions caused by them 

as licensees and wireless infrastructure owners we are also subject to regulations and guidelines that impose a variety of operational requirements relating to radio frequency emissions as employers we are subject to occupational safety and health administration and similar guidelines regarding employee protection from radio frequency exposure the potential connection between radio frequency emissions and certain negative health effects including some forms of cancer has been the subject of substantial study by the scientific community in recent years 

we have compliance programs and monitoring projects to help assure that we are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws nevertheless there can be no assurance that the costs of compliance with existing or future environmental laws will not have a material adverse effect on us 

other regulations  we hold through certain of our subsidiaries licenses for common carrier microwave service which are subject to additional regulation by the fcc we also have an fcc license relating to our 16701675 mhz us nationwide spectrum license spectrum which we have leased to a third party through 2023 subject to the lessees option to purchase the spectrum 




 item 1a risk factors 

you should carefully consider all of the risks described below as well as the other information contained in this document when evaluating your investment in our securities 

risks relating to our business 

our business depends on the demand for our wireless infrastructure driven primarily by demand for wireless connectivity and we may be adversely affected by any slowdown in such demand additionally a reduction in carrier network investment may materially and adversely affect our business including reducing demand for tenant additions or network services 

demand for our wireless infrastructure depends on the demand for antenna space from our customers which in turn depends on the demand for wireless connectivity by their customers the willingness of our customers to utilize our wireless infrastructure or renew or extend existing leases on our wireless infrastructure is affected by numerous factors including 

  6 

a slowdown in demand for wireless connectivity or our wireless infrastructure may negatively impact our growth or otherwise have a material adverse effect on us if our customers or potential customers are unable to raise adequate capital to fund their business plans as a result of disruptions in the financial and credit markets or otherwise they may reduce their spending which could adversely affect our anticipated growth or the demand for our wireless infrastructure or network services 

the amount timing and mix of our customers network investment is variable and can be significantly impacted by the various matters described in these risk factors changes in carrier network investment typically impact the demand for our wireless infrastructure as a result changes in carrier plans such as delays in the implementation of new systems new technologies including small cells or plans to expand coverage or capacity may reduce demand for our wireless infrastructure furthermore the wireless industry could experience a slowdown or slowing growth rates as a result of numerous factors including a reduction in consumer demand for wireless connectivity or general economic conditions there can be no assurances that weakness or uncertainty in the economic environment will not adversely impact the wireless industry which may materially and adversely affect our business including by reducing demand for our wireless infrastructure or network services in addition a slowdown may increase competition for site rental customers or network services a wireless industry slowdown or a reduction in carrier network investment may materially and adversely affect our business for a further discussion of our risks relating to network services see  —our network services business has historically experienced significant volatility in demand which reduces the predictability of our results below 

a substantial portion of our revenues is derived from a small number of customers and the loss consolidation or financial instability of any of our limited number of customers may materially decrease revenues or reduce demand for our wireless infrastructure and network services 

for 2015  our site rental revenues by customer were as follows 

the loss of any one of our large customers as a result of consolidation merger bankruptcy insolvency network sharing roaming joint development resale agreements by our customers or otherwise may result in 1 a material decrease in our revenues 2 uncollectible account receivables 3 an impairment of our deferred site rental receivables wireless infrastructure assets intangible assets or 4 other adverse effects to our business we cannot guarantee that leases with our major customers will not be terminated or that these customers will renew their leases with us in addition to our four largest customers we also derive a portion of our revenues and anticipated future growth from new entrants offering or contemplating offering wireless services such customers may be smaller or have less financial resources than our four largest customers have business models which may not be successful or may require additional capital see also item 1 business—the company  and note 16  to our consolidated financial statements 

consolidation among our customers will likely result in duplicate or overlapping parts of networks for example where they are coresidents on a tower which may result in the termination or nonrenewal of tenant leases and impact revenues from our wireless infrastructure we expect that any termination of tenant leases as a result of this potential consolidation would be spread over multiple years such consolidation may result in a reduction in such customers future network investment in the aggregate because their expansion plans may be similar wireless carrier consolidation could decrease the demand for our wireless infrastructure which in turn may result in a reduction in our revenues or cash flows

in recent years att tmobile and sprint acquired leap wireless metropcs and clearwire respectively during 2016  we expect site rental revenues to be impacted by nonrenewals of 70 million to 80 million as a result of the decommissioning of the acquired networks the acquired networks represented approximately 10  of our net revenues for the year ended december 31 2015  we currently expect potential nonrenewals from the decommissioning of the acquired networks to be approximately 60 of current runrate site rental revenues related to the acquired networks with the majority of such nonrenewals to occur predominately from 2016 through 2018 depending on the eventual network deployment and decommissioning plans of att tmobile and sprint the impact and timing of such nonrenewals may vary from our expectations 

see note 15  to our consolidated financial statements for a tabular presentation of the minimum rental cash payments due to us by tenants pursuant to tenant agreements without consideration of tenant renewal options 

the business model for our small cell operations contains certain differences from our traditional site rental business resulting in different operational risks if we do not successfully operate that business model or identify or manage those operational risks such operations may produce results that are less than anticipated 

the business model for our small cell operations contains certain differences from our traditional tower operations including differences relating to customer contract terms landlord demographics ownership of certain network assets operational oversight requirements including requirements for service level agreements regarding network performance and maintenance and applicable laws while our small cell operations have certain risks that are similar to our tower operations they also have certain operational risks that are different from our traditional site rental business including the 1 use of competitive local exchange carrier which we refer to as clec status 2 use of public rightsofways and franchise agreements 3 use of poles owned solely by or jointly with third parties or 4 risks relating to overbuilding we cannot be certain that we will be successful in maintaining rightofway agreements obtaining future agreements on acceptable terms or that our clec status will be recognized in addition the rate at which wireless carriers adopt or prioritize small cells may be lower or slower than we anticipate our small cell operations will also expose us to different safety or liability risks or hazards than our traditional site rental business as a result of numerous factors including the location or nature of the assets involved because small cells are comparatively new technologies and are continuing to evolve there may be other risks related to small cells of which we are not yet aware 

our substantial level of indebtedness could adversely affect our ability to react to changes in our business and the terms of our debt instruments and convertible preferred stock limit our ability to take a number of actions that our management might otherwise believe to be in our best interests in addition if we fail to comply with our covenants our debt could be accelerated 

as a result of our substantial indebtedness 

 currently we have debt instruments in place that limit in certain circumstances our ability to incur additional indebtedness pay dividends create liens sell assets or engage in certain mergers and acquisitions among other things in addition the credit agreement governing our senior unsecured credit facility agreement 2016 credit facility contains financial maintenance covenants our ability to comply with these covenants or to satisfy our debt obligations will depend on our future operating performance if we violate the restrictions in our debt instruments or fail to comply with our financial maintenance covenants we will be in default under those instruments which in some cases would cause the maturity of a substantial portion of our longterm indebtedness to be accelerated furthermore if the limits on our ability to pay dividends prevent us from satisfying our reit distribution requirements we could fail to remain qualified for taxation as a reit if these limits do not jeopardize our qualification for taxation as a reit but nevertheless prevent us from distributing 100 of our reit taxable income we will be subject to 

 8 

federal and state corporate income taxes and potentially a nondeductible excise tax on our undistributed taxable income if our operating subsidiaries were to default on their debt the trustee could seek to foreclose the collateral securing such debt in which case we could lose the wireless infrastructure and the revenues associated with the wireless infrastructure see item 7 mda—liquidity and capital resources—debt covenants  for a further discussion of our debt covenants 

ccic is a holding company that conducts all of its operations through its subsidiaries accordingly ccics sources of cash to pay interest or principal on its outstanding indebtedness are distributions relating to its respective ownership interests in its subsidiaries from the net earnings and cash flows generated by such subsidiaries or from proceeds of debt or equity offerings earnings and cash flows generated by ccics subsidiaries are first applied by such subsidiaries to conduct their operations including servicing their respective debt obligations after which any excess cash flows generally may be paid to such holding company in the absence of any special conditions such as a continuing event of default however ccics subsidiaries are legally distinct from the holding company and unless they guarantee such debt have no obligation to pay amounts due on their debt or to make funds available to us for such payment 

if we fail to pay scheduled dividends on the convertible preferred stock in cash common stock or any combination of cash and common stock we will be prohibited from paying dividends on our common stock which may jeopardize our status as a reit 

we have a substantial amount of indebtedness in the event we do not repay or refinance such indebtedness we could face substantial liquidity issues and might be required to issue equity securities or securities convertible into equity securities or sell some of our assets to meet our debt payment obligations 

we have a substantial amount of indebtedness approximately 121 billion  as of february 15 2016  which we will need to refinance or repay see item 7 mda—liquidity and capital resources  for a tabular presentation of our contractual debt maturities there can be no assurances we will be able to refinance our indebtedness 1 on commercially reasonable terms 2 on terms including with respect to interest rates as favorable as our current debt or 3 at all 

economic conditions and the credit markets have historically experienced and may continue to experience periods of volatility uncertainty or weakness that could impact the availability or cost of debt financing including any refinancing of the obligations described above or on our ability to draw the full amount of our 25 billion revolving credit facility 2016 revolver that as of february 15 2016  has 21 billion  of undrawn availability 

if we are unable to repay or refinance our debt we cannot guarantee that we will be able to generate enough cash flows from operations or that we will be able to obtain enough capital to service our debt fund our planned capital expenditures or pay future dividends in such an event we could face substantial liquidity issues and might be required to issue equity securities or securities convertible into equity securities or sell some of our assets to meet our debt payment obligations failure to repay or refinance indebtedness when required could result in a default under such indebtedness if we incur additional indebtedness any such indebtedness could exacerbate the risks described above 

sales or issuances of a substantial number of shares of our common stock may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

future sales or issuances of common stock or other equity related securities may adversely affect the market price of our common stock including any shares of our common stock issued to finance capital expenditures finance acquisitions or repay debt our business strategy contemplates access to external financing to fund certain discretionary investments which may include issuances of common stock or other equity related securities in august 2015 we established an atthemarket stock offering program atm program through which we may from time to time issue and sell shares of our common stock having an aggregate gross sales price of up to 5000 million to or through sales agents as of february 15 2016  we had 3338  shares of common stock outstanding 

we have reserved 123 million and 145 million of shares of common stock respectively for issuance in connection with awards granted under our various stock compensation plans and our convertible preferred stock which will automatically convert into common stock on november 1 2016 see item 7 mda—liquidity and capital resources—preferred stock the dividends on our convertible preferred stock may also be paid in cash or subject to certain limitations shares of common stock or any combination of cash and shares of common stock 

further a small number of common stockholders own a significant percentage of our outstanding common stock if any one of these common stockholders or any group of our common stockholders sells a large quantity of shares of our common stock or the public market perceives that existing common stockholders might sell a large quantity of shares of our common stock the market price of our common stock may significantly decline

as a result of competition in our industry we may find it more difficult to achieve favorable rental rates on our new or renewing tenant leases 

our growth is dependent on our entering into new tenant leases including amendments to leases upon modification of an existing installation as well as renewing or renegotiating tenant leases when existing tenant leases terminate competition in our industry may make it more difficult for us to attract new customers maintain or increase our gross margins or maintain or increase our market share we face competition for site rental tenants from various sources including 1 other independent wireless infrastructure owners or operators including towers rooftops broadcast towers utility poles fiber providers das or other small cells or 2 new alternative deployment methods in the wireless industry 

our small cell operations may have different competitors than our traditional site rental business including other owners of small cells or fiber as well as new entrants into small cells some of which may have larger networks or greater financial resources than we have 

new technologies may reduce demand for our wireless infrastructure or negatively impact our revenues 

improvements in the efficiency architecture and design of wireless networks may reduce the demand for our wireless infrastructure for example new technologies that may promote network sharing joint development or resale agreements by our customers such as signal combining technologies or network functions virtualization may reduce the need for our wireless infrastructure in addition other technologies such as wifi das femtocells other small cells or satellite such as low earth orbiting and mesh transmission systems may in the future serve as substitutes for or alternatives to leasing that might otherwise be anticipated or expected on wireless infrastructure had such technologies not existed in addition new technologies that enhance the range efficiency and capacity of wireless equipment could reduce demand for our wireless infrastructure any significant reduction in demand for our wireless infrastructure resulting from the new technologies may negatively impact our revenues or otherwise have a material adverse effect on us 

the expansion or development of our business including through acquisitions increased product offerings or other strategic growth opportunities may cause disruptions in our business which may have an adverse effect on our business operations or financial results 

we seek to expand and develop our business including through acquisitions increased product offerings such as small cells and fiber or other strategic growth opportunities in the ordinary course of our business we review analyze and evaluate various potential transactions or other activities in which we may engage such transactions or activities could cause disruptions in increase risk or otherwise negatively impact our business among other things such transactions and activities may 

 if we fail to retain rights to our wireless infrastructure including the land interests under our towers our business may be adversely affected 

the property interests on which our wireless infrastructure resides including the land interests under our towers consist of leasehold and subleasehold interests fee interests easements licenses and rightsofway a loss of these interests may interfere with our ability to conduct our business or generate revenues for various reasons we may not always have the ability to access analyze or verify all information regarding titles or other issues prior to purchasing wireless infrastructure further we may not be able to renew ground leases on commercially viable terms our ability to retain rights to the land interests on which our towers reside depends on our ability to purchase such land including fee interests and perpetual easements or renegotiate or extend the terms of the leases relating to such land approximately 11  of our site rental gross margins for the year ended december 31 2015  were derived from towers where the leases for the interests under such towers had final expiration dates of less than ten years if we are unable to retain rights to the property interests on which our wireless infrastructure resides our business may be adversely affected 

as of december 31 2015  approximately 54  of our towers were leased or subleased or operated and managed under master leases subleases or other agreements with att sprint and tmobile we have the option to purchase these towers at the end of their respective lease terms we have no obligation to exercise such purchase options we may not have the required available capital to exercise our right to purchase some or all of these towers at the time these options are exercisable even if we do have 

 10 

available capital we may choose not to exercise our right to purchase these towers or some or all of the tmobile or att towers for business or other reasons in the event that we do not exercise these purchase rights or are otherwise unable to acquire an interest that would allow us to continue to operate these towers after the applicable period we will lose the cash flows derived from such towers which may have a material adverse effect on our business in the event that we decide to exercise these purchase rights the benefits of the acquisition of these towers may not exceed the costs which could adversely affect our business additional information concerning these towers and the applicable purchase options as of december 31 2015  is as follows 

 under master lease or master prepaid lease arrangements we have with att sprint and tmobile certain of our subsidiaries lease or sublease or are otherwise granted the right to manage and operate towers from bankruptcy remote subsidiaries of such carriers if one of these bankruptcy remote subsidiaries should become a debtor in a bankruptcy proceeding and is permitted to reject the underlying ground lease our subsidiaries could lose their interest in the applicable sites if our subsidiaries were to lose their interest in the applicable sites or if the applicable ground leases were to be terminated we would lose the cash flow derived from the towers on those sites which may have a material adverse effect on our business we have similar bankruptcy risks with respect to sites that we operate under management agreements 

our network services business has historically experienced significant volatility in demand which reduces the predictability of our results 

the operating results of our network services business for any particular period may vary significantly and should not necessarily be considered indicative of longerterm results for this activity our network services business is generally driven by demand for our wireless infrastructure and may be adversely impacted by various factors including 

 new wireless technologies may not deploy or be adopted by customers as rapidly or in the manner projected 

there can be no assurances that new wireless services or technologies will be introduced or deployed as rapidly or in the manner projected by the wireless carriers in addition demand or customer adoption rates for such new technologies may be lower or slower than anticipated for numerous reasons as a result growth opportunities or demand for our wireless infrastructure arising from such technologies may not be realized at the times or to the extent anticipated 

 11 

if we fail to comply with laws or regulations which regulate our business and which may change at any time we may be fined or even lose our right to conduct some of our business 

a variety of federal state local and foreign laws and regulations apply to our business including those discussed in item 1 business   failure to comply with applicable requirements may lead to civil penalties or require us to assume indemnification obligations or breach contractual provisions we cannot guarantee that existing or future laws or regulations including state and local tax laws will not adversely affect our business increase delays or result in additional costs these factors may have a material adverse effect on us 

if radio frequency emissions from wireless handsets or equipment on our wireless infrastructure are demonstrated to cause negative health effects potential future claims could adversely affect our operations costs or revenues 

the potential connection between radio frequency emissions and certain negative health effects including some forms of cancer has been the subject of substantial study by the scientific community in recent years we cannot guarantee that claims relating to radio frequency emissions will not arise in the future or that the results of such studies will not be adverse to us 

public perception of possible health risks associated with cellular or other wireless connectivity services may slow or diminish the growth of wireless companies which may in turn slow or diminish our growth in particular negative public perception of and regulations regarding these perceived health risks may slow or diminish the market acceptance of wireless services if a connection between radio frequency emissions and possible negative health effects were established our operations costs or revenues may be materially and adversely affected we currently do not maintain any significant insurance with respect to these matters 

certain provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation charter amended and restated bylaws bylaws and operative agreements and domestic and international competition laws may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us or for us to acquire control of a third party even if such a change in control would be beneficial to our stockholders 

we have a number of antitakeover devices in place that will hinder takeover attempts or may reduce the market value of our common stock our antitakeover provisions include 

 our bylaws permit special meetings of the stockholders to be called only upon the request of our chief executive officer or a majority of the board of directors and deny stockholders the ability to call such meetings such provisions as well as the provisions of section 203 of the delaware general corporation law may impede a merger consolidation takeover or other business combination or discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us 

in addition domestic or international competition laws may prevent or discourage us from acquiring wireless infrastructure in certain geographical areas or impede a merger consolidation takeover or other business combination or discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us 

we may be vulnerable to security breaches that could adversely affect our operations business operations and reputation 

despite existing security measures certain of our wireless infrastructure may be vulnerable to damage disruptions or shutdowns due to unauthorized access computer viruses cyberattacks and other security breaches an attack attempt or security breach could potentially result in 1 interruption or cessation of certain of our services to our customers 2 our inability to meet expected levels of service or 3 data transmitted over our customers networks being compromised we cannot guarantee that our security measures will not be circumvented resulting in customer network failures or interruptions that could impact our customers network availability and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or operational results we may be required to expend significant resources to protect against or recover from such threats if an actual or perceived breach of our security occurs the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed and we could lose customers further the perpetrators of cyberattacks are not restricted to particular groups or persons these attacks may be committed by our employees or external actors operating in any geography any such events could result in legal claims or penalties disruption in operations misappropriation of sensitive data damage to our reputation negative market perception or costly response measures which could adversely affect our business

future dividend payments to our stockholders will reduce the availability of our cash on hand available to fund future discretionary investments and may result in a need to incur indebtedness or issue equity securities to fund growth opportunities in such event the then current economic credit market or equity market conditions will impact the availability or cost of such financing which may hinder our ability to grow our per share results of operations 

during each of the first three quarters of 2015 we paid a quarterly common stock dividend of 082 per share totaling approximately 8211 million in october 2015 we increased our quarterly dividend beginning in the fourth quarter of 2015 from an annual amount of 328 per share to an annual amount of 354 per share as such we declared a quarterly dividend of 0885 per share in october 2015 which represented an increase of 8 from the quarterly dividend declared during each of the first three quarters of 2015 we currently expect such dividends to result in aggregate annual cash payments of approximately 12 billion during the next 12 months over time we expect to increase our dividend per share generally commensurate with our realized growth in cash flows future dividends are subject to the approval of our board of directors see notes 12  and 19  to our consolidated financial statements 

effective january 1 2014 we commenced operating as a reit for us federal income tax purposes to remain qualified and be taxed as a reit we will generally be required to distribute at least 90 of our reit taxable income after the utilization of any available nols determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding net capital gain each year to our stockholders our quarterly cash common stock dividend will delay the utilization of our nols and may cause certain of the nols to expire without utilization see also item 7 mda—general overview—common stock dividend  and item 1 business—2015 industry highlights and company developments—reit election 

as discussed in item 1 mda—business—strategy  we seek to invest our capital including the net cash provided by our operating activities as well as external financing sources in a manner that we believe will increase longterm stockholder value on a riskadjusted basis our historical discretionary investments have included the following in no particular order purchasing our common stock acquiring or constructing wireless infrastructure acquiring land interests under towers improving or structurally enhancing our existing wireless infrastructure or purchasing repaying or redeeming our debt external financing including debt equity and equityrelated issuances to fund future discretionary investments either 1 may not be available to us or 2 may not be accessible by us at terms that would result in the investment of the net proceeds raised yielding incremental growth in our per share operating results as a result future dividend payments may hinder our ability to grow our per share results of operations or otherwise adversely affect our ability to execute our business plan 

see also — if we fail to pay scheduled dividends on the convertible preferred stock in cash common stock or any combination of cash and common stock we will be prohibited from paying dividends on our common stock which may jeopardize our status as a reit  below  

remaining qualified to be taxed as a reit involves highly technical and complex provisions of the us internal revenue code failure to remain qualified as a reit would result in our inability to deduct dividends to stockholders when computing our taxable income which would reduce our available cash 

effective january 1 2014 we commenced operating as a reit for us federal tax purposes as a reit we are generally entitled to a deduction for dividends that we pay and therefore are not subject to us federal corporate income tax on our net taxable income that is currently distributed to our common stockholders 

while we intend to operate so that we remain qualified as a reit given the highly complex nature of the rules governing reits the ongoing importance of factual determinations and the possibility of future changes in our circumstances no assurance can be given that we will qualify as a reit for any particular year 

if in any taxable year we fail to qualify for taxation as a reit and are not entitled to relief under the code  then 

 although we may have federal nols available to reduce any taxable income to the extent our federal nols have been utilized or are otherwise unavailable any such corporate tax liability could be substantial would reduce the amount of cash available for other purposes and might necessitate the borrowing of additional funds or the liquidation of some investments to pay any additional tax liability accordingly funds available for investment would be reduced 

 13 

under the code for taxable years beginning before 2018 no more than 25 of the value of the assets of a reit may be represented by securities of one or more trss or other nonqualifying assets for taxable years beginning in 2018 the limit on the value of assets of a reit that may be represented by securities of one or more trss or other nonqualifying assets will reduce to 20 these current or future limitations may affect our ability to make additional investments in nonreit qualifying operations or assets or in any operations held through trss the net income of our trss is not required to be distributed to us and income that is not distributed to us generally will not be subject to the reit income distribution requirement however there may be limitations on our ability to accumulate earnings in our trss and the accumulation or reinvestment of significant earnings in our trss could result in adverse tax treatment in particular if the accumulation of cash in our trss causes the fair market value of our securities in our trss or certain other nonqualifying assets to exceed current or future limitations of the fair market value of our assets at the end of any quarter then we may fail to remain qualified as a reit 

complying with reit requirements including the 90 distribution requirement may limit our flexibility or cause us to forgo otherwise attractive opportunities including certain discretionary investments and potential financing alternatives 

to remain qualified and be taxed as a reit we will generally be required to distribute at least 90 of our reit taxable income after the utilization of any available nols determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding net capital gain each year to our stockholders we commenced declaring regular quarterly dividends to our common stockholders beginning with the first quarter of 2014   see notes 12  and 19  to our consolidated financial statements any such dividends however are subject to the determination and approval of our board of directors based on thencurrent and anticipated future conditions including our earnings net cash provided by operating activities capital requirements financial condition our relative market capitalization our existing federal nols of approximately 13 billion  of which substantially all are available to offset reit taxable income or other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors 

to the extent that we satisfy the 90 distribution requirement but distribute less than 100 of our reit taxable income after the application of available nols if any we will be subject to federal corporate income tax on our undistributed taxable income in addition we will be subject to a 4 nondeductible excise tax if the actual amount that we pay out to our stockholders for a calendar year is less than a minimum amount specified under the code 

from time to time we may generate reit taxable income greater than our cash flow as a result of differences in timing between the recognition of taxable income and the actual receipt of cash or the effect of nondeductible capital expenditures the creation of reserves or required debt or amortization payments if we do not have other funds available in these situations we could be required to borrow funds on unfavorable terms sell assets at disadvantageous prices or distribute amounts that would otherwise be invested in future acquisitions to make distributions sufficient to enable us to pay out enough of our taxable income to satisfy the reit dividend requirement and to avoid corporate income tax and the 4 excise tax in a particular year these alternatives could increase our costs or reduce our equity thus compliance with the reit requirements may hinder our ability to grow which could adversely affect the value of our common stock furthermore the reit dividend requirements may increase the financing we need to fund capital expenditures future growth or expansion initiatives which would increase our total leverage 

in addition to satisfying the distribution test to remain qualified as a reit for tax purposes we will need to continually satisfy tests concerning among other things the sources of our income the nature and diversification of our assets and the ownership of our capital stock compliance with these tests will require us to refrain from certain activities and may hinder our ability to make certain attractive investments including the purchase of nonqualifying assets the expansion of nonreal estate activities or investments in the businesses to be conducted by our trss and to that extent limit our opportunities and our flexibility to change our business strategy furthermore acquisition opportunities in domestic or international markets may be adversely affected if we need or require the target company to comply with some reit requirements prior to completing any such acquisition in addition our conversion to a reit may result in investor pressures not to pursue growth opportunities that are not immediately accretive 

moreover if we fail to comply with certain asset ownership tests at the end of any calendar quarter we must correct the failure within 30 days after the end of the calendar quarter or qualify for certain statutory relief provisions to avoid losing our reit qualification as a result we may be required to liquidate assets in adverse market conditions or forgo otherwise attractive investments these actions may reduce our income and amounts available for distribution to our stockholders 

if we fail to pay scheduled dividends on the convertible preferred stock in cash common stock or any combination of cash and common stock we will be prohibited from paying dividends on our common stock which may jeopardize our status as a reit 

the terms of the convertible preferred stock provide that unless accumulated dividends have been paid or set aside for payment on all outstanding convertible preferred stock for all past dividend periods no dividends may be declared or paid on our common stock if that were to occur the inability to pay dividends on our common stock might jeopardize our status as a reit for us federal income tax purposes see note 12  to our consolidated financial statements 

 14 

we have limited experience operating as a reit our failure to successfully operate as a reit may adversely affect our financial condition cash flow the per share trading price of our common stock or our ability to satisfy debt service obligations 

we have limited operating history as a reit in addition our senior management team has limited experience operating a reit we cannot assure you that our past experience will be sufficient to operate our company successfully as a reit including our ability to remain qualified as a reit failure to maintain reit status could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations cash flow or ability to satisfy debt service obligations 

reit related ownership limitations and transfer restrictions may prevent or restrict certain transfers of our capital stock 

in order for us to continue to satisfy the requirements for reit qualification our capital stock must be beneficially owned by 100 or more persons during at least 335 days of a taxable year of 12 months or during a proportionate part of a shorter taxable year other than the first year for which an election to be a reit has been made also not more than 50 of the value of the outstanding shares of our capital stock may be owned directly or indirectly by five or fewer “individuals” as defined in the code to include certain entities such as private foundations during the last half of a taxable year other than the first taxable year for which an election to be a reit has been made in order to facilitate compliance with the reit rules our charter includes provisions that implement reitrelated ownership limitations and transfer restrictions that generally prohibit any person as defined in our charter from beneficially or constructively owning or being deemed to beneficially or constructively own by virtue of the attribution provisions of the code more than 98 by value or number of shares whichever is more restrictive of the outstanding shares of our common stock or 98 in aggregate value of the outstanding shares of all classes and series of our capital stock including our common stock and any shares of our convertible preferred stock in addition our charter provides for certain other ownership limitations and transfer restrictions under applicable constructive ownership rules any shares of capital stock owned by certain affiliated owners generally would be added together for purposes of the ownership limitations these ownership limitations and transfer restrictions could have the effect of delaying deferring or preventing a transaction or a change in control of our company that might involve a premium price for our capital stock or otherwise might be in the best interest of our stockholders

offices 

our principal corporate headquarters is owned and located in houston texas in addition we have offices throughout the us in locations convenient for the management and operation of our wireless infrastructure with significant consideration being given to the amount of our wireless infrastructure located in a particular area 

wireless infrastructure 

we own lease or manage approximately 40000  towers geographically dispersed throughout the us towers are vertical metal structures generally ranging in height from 50 to 300 feet in addition our customers wireless equipment may also be placed on building rooftops and other structures our towers are located on tracts of land with an average size of approximately 15000 square feet these tracts of land support the towers equipment shelters and where applicable guywires to stabilize the structure 

additionally we own approximately 16000  miles of fiber supporting our small cells designed to facilitate wireless connectivity the majority of our fiber are located in major metropolitan areas our small cells are typically located in areas in which zoning restrictions or other barriers may prevent or delay the deployment of a tower and often are attached to public rightofway infrastructure including utility poles or street lights 

see item 1 business—overview  for information regarding our wireless infrastructure portfolio including our land interests and for a discussion of the location of our towers including the percentage of our towers in the top 50 and 100 btas see item 7 mda—liquidity and capital resources—contractual cash obligations  for a tabular presentation of the remaining terms to final expiration of the leases for the land interests which we do not own and on which our towers are located as of december 31 2015  

as of february 15 2016  approximately 48  of our debt is secured certain of our wireless infrastructure is held in subsidiaries whose equity interests have been pledged directly or indirectly along with other collateral to secure such indebtedness see note 8  to our consolidated financial statements 

approximately 54  of our towers are leased or subleased or operated and managed under master leases subleases or other agreements with att sprint and tmobile we have the option to purchase these towers at the end of their respective lease terms we have no obligation to exercise such purchase options see note 1  to our consolidated financial statements and item 1a risk factors  for a further discussion 

substantially all of our wireless infrastructure can accommodate additional tenancy either as currently constructed or with appropriate modifications to the structure which may include extensions or structural reinforcement additionally if so inclined as a result of a customer request for a tenant addition we could generally replace an existing tower with another tower in its place providing additional capacity subject to certain restrictions 

 16 

as of december 31 2015  the average number of tenants defined as a unique license or any related amendments thereto for count purposes per tower is approximately 22  on our towers the following chart sets forth the number of existing tenants per tower as of december 31 2015  see item 7 mda—accounting and reporting matters—critical accounting policies and estimates  for a discussion of our impairment evaluation and our towers with no tenants 




 item 3 legal proceedings 

we are periodically involved in legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business most of these proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business involve disputes with landlords vendors collection matters involving bankrupt customers zoning or variance matters condemnation tax employment or wrongful termination matters while the outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty management does not expect any pending matters to have a material adverse effect on us

results of operations 

we have determined that presently following the sale of ccal we have one reportable operating segment consisting of our us operations which is consistent with our current operational and financial reporting structure our financial results are currently reported to the chief operating decision maker and the board of directors in this manner

our measurement of profit or loss currently used to evaluate our operating performance and operating segments is earnings before interest taxes depreciation amortization and accretion as adjusted adjusted ebitda our measure of adjusted ebitda may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies including companies in the tower sector or other similar providers of wireless infrastructure and is not a measure of performance calculated in accordance with us gaap see item 2 mda—accounting and reporting matters—nongaap financial measures  for a discussion of our use of adjusted ebitda including its definition and a reconciliation to net income loss

accounting and reporting matters 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the following is a discussion of the accounting policies and estimates that we believe 1 are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations or 2 require our most difficult subjective or complex judgments often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain the critical accounting policies and estimates for 2015  are not intended to be a comprehensive list of our accounting policies and estimates see note 2  to our consolidated financial statements for a summary of our significant accounting policies in many cases the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by gaap in other cases management is required to exercise judgment in the application of accounting principles with respect to particular transactions 

revenue recognition   82  of our total revenue for 2015  consists of site rental revenues which are recognized on a monthly basis over the fixed noncancelable term of the relevant lease generally ranging from five to 15 years regardless of whether the payments from the tenant are received in equal monthly amounts if the payment terms call for fixed escalations as in fixed dollar or fixed percentage increases upfront payments or rent free periods the revenue is recognized on a straightline basis over the fixed noncancelable term of the lease when calculating our straightline rental revenues we consider all fixed elements of tenant contractual escalation provisions even if such escalation provisions contain a variable element such as an escalator tied to an inflationbased index in addition to a minimum to the extent we acquire belowmarket tenant leases for contractual interests with tenants on the acquired wireless infrastructure for example with respect to small cells we record deferred credits and amortize such deferred credits to site rental revenues over their estimated lease term since we recognize revenue on a straightline basis a portion of the site rental revenue in a given period represents cash collected or contractually collectible in other periods our assets related to straightline site rental revenues are included in other current assets and deferred site rental receivables net amounts billed or received prior to being earned are deferred and reflected in deferred revenues and other longterm liabilities see notes 2  and 7  to our consolidated financial statements 

as part of our effort to provide comprehensive wireless infrastructure solutions we offer certain network services relating to our wireless infrastructure which represent approximately 18  of our total revenues for 2015  network services and other revenue consists of 1 site development services and 2 installation services network services revenues are recognized after completion of the applicable service we account for network services separately from the customers site rental see item 1 business—the company  for a further discussion of our business 

 35 

accounting for acquisitions — general as described in  item 1 business  much of our wireless infrastructure has been acquired in various transactions from the four largest wireless carriers or their predecessors through transactions consummated since 1999 we evaluate each of our acquisitions to determine if it should be accounted for as a business combination or as an acquisition of assets for our business combinations we allocate the purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair value at the date of acquisition any purchase price in excess of the net fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is allocated to goodwill see item 7 mda—accounting and reporting matters—accounting for acquisitions—valuation below 

the determination of the final purchase price allocation could extend over several quarters resulting in the use of preliminary estimates that are subject to adjustment until finalized such changes could have a significant impact on our financial statements 

accounting for acquisitions — leases with respect to business combinations that include towers that we lease and operate such as the att tmobile and sprint leased and subleased towers we evaluate such agreements to determine treatment as capital or operating leases the evaluation of such agreements for capital or operating lease treatment includes consideration of each of the lease classification criteria under asc 8401025 namely 1 the transfer of ownership provisions 2 the existence of bargain purchase options 3 the length of the remaining lease term and 4 the present value of the minimum lease payments with respect to the att acquisition tmobile acquisition and the sprint towers acquired in the global signal acquisition we determined that the tower leases were capital leases and the underlying land leases were operating leases based upon the lease term criterion after considering the fragmentation criteria applicable under asc 8401025 to leases involving both land and buildings ie towers we determined that the fragmentation criteria was met and the tower leases could be accounted for as capital leases apart from the land leases which are accounted for as operating leases since 1 the fair value of the land in the aforementioned business combinations was greater than 25 of the total fair value of the leased property at inception and 2 the tower lease expirations occur beyond 75 of the estimated economic life of the tower assets 

accounting for acquisitions — valuation  as of december 31 2015  our largest asset was property and equipment which primarily consists of wireless infrastructure followed by goodwill and intangible assets our identifiable intangible assets predominately relate to the site rental contracts and customer relationships intangible assets see note 2  to our consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the nature and composition of the site rental contracts and customer relationships intangible assets 

the fair value of the vast majority of our assets and liabilities is determined by using either 

 the purchase price allocation requires subjective estimates that if incorrectly estimated could be material to our consolidated financial statements including the amount of depreciation amortization and accretion expense the most important estimates for measurement of tangible fixed assets are 1 the cost to replace the asset with a new asset and 2 the economic useful life after giving effect to age quality and condition the most important estimates for measurement of intangible assets are 1 discount rates and 2 timing and amount of cash flows including estimates regarding customer renewals and cancellations the most important estimates for measurement of above and belowmarket leases is the determination of 1 favorability or unfavorability to the current market terms and 2 applicable lease term including whether renewals or extensions should be measured with respect to business combinations that include towers that we lease and operate such as the tmobile sprint and att leased and subleased towers we evaluate such agreements to determine treatment as capital or operating leases and identification of any bargain purchase options 

we record the fair value of obligations to perform certain asset retirement activities including requirements pursuant to our ground leases or easements to remove wireless infrastructure or remediate the land upon which our wireless infrastructure resides in determining the fair value of these asset retirement obligations we must make several subjective and highly judgmental estimates such as those related to 1 timing of cash flows 2 future costs 3 discount rates and 4 the probability of enforcement to remove the towers or small cells or remediate the land see note 2  to our consolidated financial statements 

accounting for longlived assets — useful lives  we are required to make subjective assessments as to the useful lives of our tangible and intangible assets for purposes of determining depreciation amortization and accretion expense that if incorrectly estimated could be material to our consolidated financial statements depreciation expense for our property and equipment is computed using the straightline method over the estimated useful lives of our various classes of tangible assets the substantial portion of our property and equipment represents the cost of our wireless infrastructure which is depreciated with an estimated useful life equal to the shorter of 1 20 years or 2 the term of the lease including optional renewals for the land interests under the wireless infrastructure 

 36 

the useful life of our intangible assets is estimated based on the period over which the intangible asset is expected to benefit us and gives consideration to the expected useful life of other assets to which the useful life may relate we review the expected useful lives of our intangible assets on an ongoing basis and adjust if necessary amortization expense for intangible assets is computed using the straightline method over the estimated useful life of each of the intangible assets the useful life of the site rental contracts and customer relationships intangible assets is limited by the maximum depreciable life of the wireless infrastructure 20 years as a result of the interdependency of the wireless infrastructure and site rental contracts and customer relationships in contrast the site rental contracts and customer relationships are estimated to provide economic benefits for several decades because of the low rate of tenant cancellations and high rate of renewals experienced to date thus while site rental contracts and customer relationships are valued based upon the fair value of the site rental contracts and customer relationships which includes assumptions regarding both 1 tenants exercise of optional renewals contained in the acquired leases and 2 renewals of the acquired leases past the contractual term including exercisable options the site rental contracts are amortized over a period not to exceed 20 years as a result of the useful life being limited by the depreciable life of the wireless infrastructure 

accounting for longlived assets — impairment evaluation — intangibles  we review the carrying values of property and equipment intangible assets or other longlived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable we utilize the following dual grouping policy for purposes of determining the unit of account for testing impairment of the site rental contracts and customer relationships 

 we first pool site rental contracts and customer relationships intangible assets and property and equipment into portfolio groups for purposes of determining the unit of account for impairment testing because we view wireless infrastructure as portfolios and wireless infrastructure in a given portfolio and its related tenant leases are not largely independent of the other wireless infrastructure in the portfolio we reevaluate the appropriateness of the pooled groups at least annually this use of grouping is based in part on 1 our limitations regarding disposal of wireless infrastructure 2 the interdependencies of wireless infrastructure portfolios and 3 the manner in which wireless infrastructure is traded in the marketplace the vast majority of our site rental contracts and customer relationships intangible assets and property and equipment are pooled into the us owned wireless infrastructure group secondly and separately we pool site rental contracts and customer relationships by significant tenant or by tenant grouping for individually insignificant tenants as appropriate for purposes of determining the unit of account for impairment testing because we associate the value ascribed to site rental contracts and customer relationships intangible assets to the underlying contracts and related customer relationships acquired 

our determination that an adverse event or change in circumstance has occurred that indicates that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable will generally involve 1 a deterioration in an assets financial performance compared to historical results 2 a shortfall in an assets financial performance compared to forecasted results or 3 changes affecting the utility and estimated future demands for the asset when considering the utility of our assets we consider events that would meaningfully impact 1 our wireless infrastructure or 2 our customer relationships for example consideration would be given to events that impact 1 the structural integrity and longevity of our wireless infrastructure or 2 our ability to derive benefit from our existing customer relationships including events such as bankruptcy or insolvency or loss of a significant customer during 2015  there were no events or circumstances that caused us to review the carrying value of our intangible assets or property and equipment due in part to our assets performing consistently with or better than our expectations 

if the sum of the estimated future cash flows undiscounted from an asset or portfolio group significant tenant or tenant group for individually insignificant tenants as applicable is less than its carrying amount an impairment loss may be recognized if the carrying value were to exceed the undiscounted cash flows measurement of an impairment loss would be based on the fair value of the asset which is based on an estimate of discounted future cash flows the most important estimates for such calculations of undiscounted cash flows are 1 the expected additions of new tenants and equipment on our wireless infrastructure and 2 estimates regarding tenant cancellations and renewals of leases we could record impairments in the future if changes in longterm market conditions expected future operating results or the utility of the assets results in changes for our impairment test calculations which negatively impact the fair value of our property and equipment and intangible assets or if we changed our unit of account in the future 

 37 

when grouping assets into pools for purposes of impairment evaluation we also consider individual towers nodes and third party land interests within a grouping for which we currently have no tenants approximately 2  of our total towers currently have no tenants we continue to pay operating expenses on these towers in anticipation of obtaining tenants on these towers in the future primarily because of the individual tower site demographics we estimate based on current visibility potential tenants on approximately half of these towers to the extent we do not believe there are longterm prospects of obtaining tenants on an individual tower node or third party land interest and all other possible avenues for recovering the carrying value has been exhausted including sale of the asset we appropriately reduce the carrying value of such assets to fair value 

accounting for longlived assets — impairment evaluation — goodwill  we test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis regardless of whether adverse events or changes in circumstances have occurred the annual test begins with goodwill and all intangible assets being allocated to applicable reporting units we then perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount if it is concluded that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount it is necessary to perform the twostep goodwill impairment test otherwise the twostep goodwill impairment test is not required during 2015 we sold our australian operations and our reporting units changed from us operations and australian operations to towers and small cells we performed a relative fair value allocation of goodwill when the change in reporting units occurred see notes 3  and 16  to our consolidated financial statements regarding the sale of ccal and change in reportable segmentswe performed our most recent annual goodwill impairment test as of october 1 2015  which resulted in no impairments this assessment included consideration of our market capitalization which exceeded over three times the aggregate carrying amount of the reporting units as of december 31 2015  

deferred income taxes  effective january 1 2014 we commenced operating as a reit for us federal income tax purposes    our reit taxable income is generally not subject to federal and state income taxes as a result of the deduction for dividends paid and any usage of our remaining nols accordingly the only provision or benefit for federal income taxes for the year ended december 31 2015  relates to trss furthermore as a result of the deduction for dividends paid some or all of our nols related to our reit may expire without utilization see  item 1 business—2015 industry highlights and company developments—reit election  for a discussion of the impact of our reit election 

our trss will continue to be subject as applicable to federal and state income taxes and foreign taxes in the jurisdictions in which such assets and operations are located see  item 1 business—2015 industry highlights and company developments—reit election  for a discussion of  our inclusion of small cells in the reit effective january 1 2016 our ability to utilize our nols is dependent in part upon our having sufficient future earnings to utilize our nols before they expire if market conditions change materially and we determine that we will be unable to generate sufficient taxable income in the future to utilize our nols we would be required to record an additional valuation allowance which would reduce our earnings such adjustments could cause a material effect on our results of operations for the period of the adjustment the change in our valuation allowance has no effect on our cash flows for a further discussion of our benefit provision for income taxes and our reit conversion see item 7 mda—results of operations  and note 11  to our consolidated financial statements

nongaap financial measures 

our measurement of profit or loss currently used to evaluate the operating performance of our operating segments is earnings before interest taxes depreciation amortization and accretion as adjusted or adjusted ebitda our definition of adjusted ebitda is set forth in item 7 mda—results of operations    our measure of adjusted ebitda may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies including companies in the tower sector and other similar providers of wireless infrastructure and is not a measure of performance calculated in accordance with gaap adjusted ebitda should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for operating income or loss net income or loss net cash provided by used for operating investing and financing activities or other income statement or cash flow statement data prepared in accordance with gaap 

we define adjusted ebitda as net income loss plus restructuring charges credits asset writedown charges acquisition and integration costs depreciation amortization and accretion amortization of prepaid lease purchase price adjustments interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs gains losses on retirement of longterm obligations net gain loss on interest rate swaps gains losses on foreign currency swaps impairment of availableforsale securities interest income other income expense benefit provision for income taxes cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle income loss from discontinued operations and stockbased compensation expense the reconciliation of adjusted ebitda to our net income loss is set forth below adjusted ebitda is not intended as an alternative measure of operating results or cash flows from operations 

 38 

as determined in accordance with gaap and our definition of adjusted ebitda may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies 



  

 we believe adjusted ebitda is useful to an investor in evaluating our operating performance because 

 our management uses adjusted ebitda 

  39 

there are material limitations to using a measure such as adjusted ebitda including the difficulty associated with comparing results among more than one company including our competitors and the inability to analyze certain significant items including depreciation and interest expense that directly affect our net income or loss management compensates for these limitations by considering the economic effect of the excluded expense items independently as well as in connection with their analysis of net income loss 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

our primary exposures to market risks are related to changes in interest rates which may adversely affect our results of operations and financial position we seek to manage exposure to changes in interest rates where economically prudent to do so by utilizing fixed rate debt 

our interest rate risk relates primarily to the impact of interest rate movements on the following after giving effect to our 2016 refinancings 

 potential refinancing of existing debt 

over the next 12 months we have no debt maturities other than principal payments on amortizing debt we have no debt maturities that have anticipated repayment dates during 2016  as of december 31 2015  and december 31 2014 we had no interest rate swaps hedging any refinancings see below for a tabular presentation of our scheduled contractual debt maturities as of december 31 2015  after giving effect to our 2016 refinancings and a discussion of anticipated repayment dates 

floating rate debt 

we manage our exposure to market interest rates on our existing debt by controlling the mix of fixed and floating rate debt as of december 31 2015  after giving effect to our 2016 refinancings we had 24 billion  of floating rate debt none of which had libor floors as a result a hypothetical unfavorable fluctuation in market interest rates on our existing debt of 18 of a percent point over a 12month period would increase our interest expense by approximately 29 million  after giving effect to our 2016 refinancings as of december 31 2014 we had 42 billion of floating rate debt which included 28 billion of debt with a libor floor of 075 per annum 

potential future borrowings of incremental debt 

we typically do not hedge our exposure to interest rates on potential future borrowings of incremental debt for a substantial period prior to issuance see item 7 mda—liquidity and capital resources  regarding our liquidity strategy 

 40 

the following table provides information about our market risk related to changes in interest rates the future principal payments and weightedaverage interest rates are presented as of december 31 2015  after giving effect to our 2016 refinancings these debt maturities reflect contractual maturity dates and do not consider the impact of the principal payments that will commence following the anticipated repayment dates of certain notes see footnotes c and d see note 8  to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our debt

overview 

we own operate and lease shared wireless infrastructure including 1 towers and other structures such as rooftops collectively towers and to a lesser extent 2 distributed antenna systems das a type of small cell network small cells and 3 interests in land under third party towers in various forms third party land interests collectively wireless infrastructure our core business is providing access including space or capacity to our wireless infrastructure via longterm contracts in various forms including license sublease and lease agreements collectively leases our wireless infrastructure can accommodate multiple tenants for antennas or other equipment necessary for the transmission of signals for wireless communication devices we seek to increase our site rental revenues by adding more tenants on our wireless infrastructure which we expect to result in significant incremental cash flows due to our relatively fixed operating costs 

effective january 1 2014 we commenced operating as a reit for us federal income tax purposes see item 7 mda—general overview—reit election 

certain information concerning our business as of december 31 2014  is as follows 

 certain information concerning our customers and site rental leases as of and for the year ended december 31 2014  is as follows 

 as part of our effort to provide comprehensive wireless infrastructure solutions we offer certain network services relating to our wireless infrastructure predominately consisting of 1 installation of tenant equipment or subsequent augmentation collectively installation services and 2 the following additional site development services site acquisition architectural and engineering or zoning and permitting

strategy 

our strategy is to create longterm stockholder value via a combination of 1 growing cash flows generated from our portfolio of wireless infrastructure 2 returning a meaningful portion of our cash provided by operating activities to our stockholders in the form of dividends and 3 investing capital efficiently to grow longterm dividends per share we measure our efforts to create longterm stockholder value by the combined payment of dividends to stockholders and growth in our per share results the key elements of our strategy are to 

 our strategy to create longterm stockholder value is based on our belief that additional demand for our wireless infrastructure will be created by the expected continued growth in the wireless communication services industry which is predominately driven by the demand for wireless data services by consumers we believe that such demand for our wireless infrastructure will continue will result in growth of our cash flows due to new tenant additions on our existing wireless infrastructure and will create other growth opportunities for us such as demand for new wireless infrastructure 

2014  industry highlights and company developments 

see item 1 business—overview item 7 mda  and our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of developments and activities that occurred in 2014  including 1 the commencement of and subsequent increase in our quarterly cash common stock dividend 2 our debt refinancing activities during 2014 2014 refinancings and 3 the commencement of our operating as a reit 

as discussed above and in item 7 mda  we commenced operating as a reit for us federal income tax purposes effective january 1 2014 our small cells are currently included in one or more whollyowned taxable reit subsidiaries trss in august 2014 we received a favorable private letter ruling from the internal revenue service irs which provides that the real property portion of our small cells and the related rents qualify as real property and rents from real property respectively under the rules governing reits we are evaluating the impact of this private letter ruling and subject to board approval we expect to take appropriate action to include at least some part of our small cells as part of the reit during 2015 once we have completed our evaluation and necessary actions to include small cells in the reit we expect to derecognize our net deferred tax liabilities related to such part of our small cells 

additionally we have included in trss our tower operations in australia and certain other assets and operations those trs assets and operations along with any part of our small cells that may remain in a trs will continue to be subject as 

 2 

applicable to federal and state corporate income taxes and to foreign taxes in the jurisdictions in which such assets and operations are located our foreign assets and operations including our tower operations in puerto rico and australia most likely will be subject to foreign income taxes in the jurisdictions in which such assets and operations are located regardless of whether they are included in a trs or not 

as a reit we are generally entitled to a deduction for dividends that we pay and therefore are not subject to us federal corporate income tax on our taxable income that is currently distributed to our stockholders see item 1a risk factors—risk relating to our reit election and notes 2 and 10  to our consolidated financial statements the increase to our common stock dividend announced in october 2014 will delay the utilization of our nols and may cause certain of the nols to expire without utilization 

during 2014  consumer demand for wireless services continued to grow this growth in wireless services is driven by the increased usage of wireless data applications including 1 mobile entertainment such as mobile video mobile applications and social networking 2 mobile internet usage such as email and web browsing and 3 machinetomachine applications as a result consumer wireless devices are trending toward bandwidthintensive devices such as smartphones laptops tablets and other emerging devices 

the major us wireless carriers are in various stages of deploying 4g longterm evolution lte networks which has translated into additional demand for our wireless infrastructure we expect that consumers growing wireless consumption will likely result in wireless carriers continuing to invest in network capital expenditures that focus on improving network quality and capacity by adding additional antennas or other equipment for the transmission of their services to wireless infrastructure in an effort to improve customer retention or satisfaction additionally spectrum licensed by the federal communications commission fcc has enabled continued wireless carrier network development we expect this development and the potential availability of additional spectrum through several planned government auctions to enable continued future carrier network development and potential demand for our wireless infrastructure 

the company 

virtually all of our operations are located in the us and australia we conduct substantially all of our operations through subsidiaries of crown castle operating company ccoc including 1 certain subsidiaries which operate our wireless infrastructure portfolios in the us and 2 a 776 owned subsidiary that operates our australia tower portfolio for more information about our operating segments as well as financial information about the geographic areas in which we operate see note 15  to our consolidated financial statements and item 7 mda   

ccusa 

site rental  the core business of ccusa is providing access including space or capacity to our wireless infrastructure in the us we predominately provide access to wireless carriers under longterm leases for their antennas which transmit a variety of signals related to wireless voice and data we believe our wireless infrastructure is integral to our customers networks and their ability to serve their customers 

we acquired ownership interests or exclusive rights to the majority of our towers in ccusa from the four largest us wireless carriers or their predecessors through transactions consummated since 1999 including transactions with 1 att in 2013 att acquisition 2 tmobile in 2012 tmobile acquisition 3 global signal inc in 2007 global signal acquisition  which had originally acquired the majority of its towers from sprint 4 companies now part of verizon wireless during 1999 and 2000 and 5 companies now part of att during 1999 and 2000 our small cell assets include those acquired from nextg networks inc in 2012 nextg acquisition 

we generally receive monthly rental payments from tenants payable under longterm leases we have existing master lease agreements with most us wireless carriers including verizon wireless att sprint and tmobile such agreements provide certain terms including economic terms that govern leases on our towers entered into by such carriers during the term of their master lease agreements we generally negotiate initial contract terms of five to 15 years with multiple renewal periods at the option of the tenant of five to ten years each and our leases typically include fixed escalations we continue to endeavor to negotiate with our existing customer base for longer contractual terms which often contain fixed escalation rates 

our tenant leases have historically had a high renewal rate with limited exceptions our tenant leases may not be terminated prior to the end of their current term and nonrenewals have averaged approximately 2 of site rental revenues over the last five years see item 1a risk factors  regarding future anticipated nonrenewals as a result of the sprint iden decommissioning and the decommissioning at least in part of the former leap wireless metropcs and clearwire networks acquired networks in general each tenant lease which is renewable will automatically renew at the end of its term unless the tenant provides prior 

 3 

notice of its intent not to renew see note 14  to our consolidated financial statements for a tabular presentation of the minimum rental cash payments due to us by tenants pursuant to tenant agreements without consideration of tenant renewal options 

the average monthly rental payment of a new tenant added to wireless infrastructure can vary based on 1 aggregate tenant volume 2 the different regions in the us or 3 the physical size weight and shape of the antenna installation and related equipment with respect to our small cells the amount of the monthly payments can also be influenced by similar factors as well as the amount or cost of 1 construction for initial and subsequent tenants 2 fiber strands 3 equipment at the site or 4 any upfront payments received we also routinely receive rental payment increases in connection with lease amendments pursuant to which our tenants add additional antennas or other equipment to wireless infrastructure on which they already have equipment pursuant to preexisting leases 

in excess of twothirds of our direct site operating expenses consist of lease expenses and the remainder includes property taxes repairs and maintenance employee compensation or related benefit costs or utilities our cash operating expenses tend to escalate at approximately the rate of inflation partially offset by reductions in cash lease expenses from our purchases of land interests as a result of the relatively fixed nature of these expenditures the addition of new tenants is achieved at a low incremental operating cost resulting in high incremental operating cash flows our wireless infrastructure portfolio requires minimal sustaining capital expenditures including maintenance or other nondiscretionary capital expenditures and are typically less than 2 of net revenues see note 14  to our consolidated financial statements for a tabular presentation of the rental cash payments owed by us to landlords pursuant to our contractual agreements 

network services  as part of ccusas effort to provide comprehensive solutions it offers certain network services relating to its wireless infrastructure predominately consisting of 1 installation services and 2 the following additional site development services site acquisition architectural and engineering or zoning and permitting for 2014  55 of ccusas network services and other revenues related to installation services and the remainder predominately related to additional site development services we have grown our network service revenues over the last several years as a result of increased volumes resulting from carrier network upgrades promoting site development services expanding the scope of our services and our focus on customer service and deployment speed we have the capability and expertise to install with the assistance of our network of subcontractors equipment or antenna systems for our customers we do not always provide the installation or site development services for our customers on our wireless infrastructure as third parties also provide these services see also —competition below these activities are typically nonrecurring and highly competitive with a number of local competitors in most markets typically our antenna installation services are billed on a costplus profit basis and site development services are billed on a fixed fee basis 

customers  we work extensively with large national wireless carriers and in general our customers are primarily comprised of providers of wireless services that operate national or regional networks in the us our four largest customers att sprint tmobile and verizon wireless accounted for an aggregate of 88  of our 2014  consolidated site rental revenues see item 1a risk factors  and note 15  to our consolidated financial statements 

sales and marketing  our sales organization markets our wireless infrastructure within the wireless communication services industry with the objective of providing access to existing wireless infrastructure or to new wireless infrastructure prior to construction  we seek to become the critical partner and preferred independent wireless infrastructure provider for our customers and increase customer satisfaction relative to our peers by leveraging our 1 customer relationships 2 processcentric approach and 3 technological tools 

a team of national account directors maintains our relationships with our largest customers these directors work to develop wireless infrastructure leasing as well as to ensure that customers wireless infrastructure needs are efficiently translated into new leases on our wireless infrastructure sales personnel in our area offices develop and maintain local relationships with our customers that are expanding their networks entering new markets bringing new technologies to market or requiring maintenance or addon business in addition to our fulltime sales or marketing staff a number of senior managers and officers spend a significant portion of their time on sales and marketing activities and call on existing or prospective customers 

competition  we face competition for site rental tenants from various sources including 

 some of the larger independent tower companies with which we compete in the us include american tower corporation and sba communications corporation we believe that tower location deployment speed quality of service capacity and price 

 4 

have been and will continue to be the most significant competitive factors affecting the leasing of wireless infrastructure see item 1a risk factors 

competitors in our network services offering include site acquisition consultants zoning consultants real estate firms rightofway consulting firms construction companies tower owners or managers radio frequency engineering consultants telecommunications equipment vendors who can provide turnkey site development services through multiple subcontractors or our customers internal staff we believe that our customers base their decisions on the outsourcing of network services on criteria such as a companys experience track record local reputation price or time for completion of a project 

ccal 

our primary business in australia is providing access to space on towers to our customers we own 776 of ccal ccal is the largest independent tower operator in australia as of december 31 2014  55 of ccals towers were located in seven major metropolitan areas the majority of ccals towers were acquired from optus in 2000 and vodafone in 2001 for 2014  ccal comprised approximately 4  of our consolidated net revenues ccals principal customers are telstra optus and vodafone hutchison australia which collectively accounted for approximately 85 of ccals 2014  revenues in addition we believe that the continued development of the national broadband network a national highspeed openaccess data network may result in additional future demand for new tenant additions on ccals existing towers or the construction of new towers 

in australia ccal competes with wireless carriers that own and operate their own tower networks and other site owners including broadcast australia an independent operator of broadcast towers we believe that tower location capacity quality of service deployment speed or price within a geographic market are the most significant competitive factors affecting the leasing of wireless infrastructure in australia 

in february 2015 we announced plans to explore the potential sale of ccal there can be no assurances that the exploration of a potential sale will result in a transaction 

employees 

at january 31 2015  we employed approximately 2400 people worldwide including approximately 2200 in the us we are not a party to any collective bargaining agreements we have not experienced any strikes or work stoppages and management believes that our employee relations are satisfactory 

regulatory and environmental matters 

to date we have not incurred any material fines or penalties or experienced any material adverse effects to our business as a result of any domestic or international regulations the summary below is based on regulations currently in effect and such regulations are subject to review or modification by the applicable governmental authority from time to time if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations we may be fined or even lose our rights to conduct some of our business 

united states 

we are required to comply with a variety of federal state and local regulations and laws in the us including fcc and federal aviation administration faa regulations and those discussed under —environmental  below 

federal regulations  both the fcc and the faa regulate towers used for wireless communications radio or television broadcasting such regulations control the siting lighting or marking of towers and may depending on the characteristics of particular towers require the registration of tower facilities with the fcc and the issuance of determinations confirming no hazard to air traffic wireless communications devices operating on towers are separately regulated and independently licensed based upon the particular frequency used in addition the fcc and the faa have developed standards to consider proposals for new or modified tower or antenna structures based upon the height or location including proximity to airports proposals to construct or to modify existing tower or antenna structures above certain heights are reviewed by the faa to ensure the structure will not present a hazard to aviation which determination may be conditioned upon compliance with lighting or marking requirements the fcc requires its licensees to operate communications devices only on towers that comply with faa rules and are registered with the fcc if required by its regulations where tower lighting is required by faa regulation tower owners bear the responsibility of notifying the faa of any tower lighting outage and ensuring the timely restoration of such outages failure to comply with the applicable requirements may lead to civil penalties 

local regulations  the us telecommunications act of 1996 amended the communications act of 1934 to preserve state and local zoning authorities jurisdiction over the siting of communications towers and small cells the law however limits local zoning authority by prohibiting actions by local authorities that discriminate between different service providers of wireless services 

 5 

or ban altogether the provision of wireless services additionally the law prohibits state and local restrictions based on the environmental effects of radio frequency emissions to the extent the facilities comply with fcc regulations 

local regulations include city and other local ordinances including subdivision and zoning ordinances approvals for construction modification and removal of towers and small cells and restrictive covenants imposed by community developers these regulations vary greatly but typically require us to obtain approval from local officials prior to tower construction local zoning authorities may render decisions that prevent the construction or modification of towers or place conditions on such construction or modifications that are responsive to community residents concerns regarding the height visibility or other characteristics of the towers over the last several years there have been several developments related to fcc regulations and legislation that assist in expediting and streamlining the deployment of wireless networks including establishing timeframes for reviews by local and state governments notwithstanding such legislative and fcc actions decisions of local zoning authorities may also adversely affect the timing or cost of wireless infrastructure construction or modification 

some of our small cell related subsidiaries hold authorization to provide intrastate telecommunication services as competitive local exchange carriers clec in numerous states and to provide domestic interstate telecommunication services as authorized by the fcc these small cell subsidiaries are primarily regulated by state public service commissions which have jurisdiction over public rightsofway clec status in certain cases helps promote access to such public rightsofway which is beneficial to the deployment of our small cell on a timely basis status as a clec often allows us to deploy our small cell systems in locations where zoning restrictions might otherwise delay restrict or prevent building or expanding traditional wireless tower sites or traditional wireless rooftop sites 

environmental we are required to comply with a variety of federal state and local environmental laws and regulations protecting environmental quality including air and water quality and wildlife protection to date we have not incurred any material fines or penalties or experienced any material adverse effects to our business as a result of any domestic or international environmental regulations or matters see item 1a risk factors 

the construction of new towers or in some cases the modification of existing towers in the us may be subject to environmental review under the national environmental policy act of 1969 as amended nepa which requires federal agencies to evaluate the environmental impact of major federal actions the fcc has promulgated regulations implementing nepa which require applicants to investigate the potential environmental impact of the proposed tower construction should the proposed tower construction present a significant environmental impact the fcc must prepare an environmental impact statement subject to public comment if the proposed construction or modification of a tower may have a significant impact on the environment the fccs approval of the construction or modification could be significantly delayed 

our operations are subject to federal state and local laws and regulations relating to the management use storage disposal emission or remediation of or exposure to hazardous or nonhazardous substances materials or wastes as an owner lessee or operator of real property we are subject to certain environmental laws that impose strict jointandseveral liability for the cleanup of onsite or offsite contamination relating to existing or historical operations or we could also be subject to personal injury or property damage claims relating to such contamination in general our customer contracts prohibit our customers from using or storing any hazardous substances on our tower sites in violation of applicable environmental laws and require our customers to provide notice of certain environmental conditions caused by them 

as licensees and wireless infrastructure owners we are also subject to regulations and guidelines that impose a variety of operational requirements relating to radio frequency emissions as employers we are subject to occupational safety and health administration and similar occupational health and safety legislation in australia and similar guidelines regarding employee protection from radio frequency exposure the potential connection between radio frequency emissions and certain negative health effects including some forms of cancer has been the subject of substantial study by the scientific community in recent years 

we have compliance programs and monitoring projects to help assure that we are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws nevertheless there can be no assurance that the costs of compliance with existing or future environmental laws will not have a material adverse effect on us 

other regulations  we hold through certain of our subsidiaries licenses for common carrier microwave service which are subject to additional regulation by the fcc our fcc license relating to our 16701675 mhz us nationwide spectrum license spectrum has been granted conditional renewal subject to certain construction requirements being met by october 1 2015 we have leased the spectrum to a third party through 2023 subject to the lessees option to purchase the spectrum

australia 

federal regulations  carrier licenses and nominated carrier declarations issued under the australian telecommunications act 1997 authorize the use of network units for the supply of telecommunications services to the public the definition of network units includes line links and base stations used for wireless voice services but does not include tower infrastructure accordingly ccal as a tower owner and operator does not require a carrier license under the australian telecommunications act 1997 similarly because ccal does not own any transmitters or spectrum it does not currently require any apparatus or spectrum licenses issued under the australian radiocommunications act 1992 

carriers have a statutory obligation to provide other carriers with access to towers and if there is a dispute including a pricing dispute the matter may be referred to the australian competition and consumer commission for resolution as a noncarrier ccal is not subject to this requirement and our customers negotiate site access on a commercial basis 

while the australian telecommunications act 1997 grants certain exemptions from planning laws for the installation of low impact facilities newly constructed towers are expressly excluded from the definition of low impact facilities accordingly in connection with the construction of towers ccal is subject to state and local planning laws that vary on a sitebysite basis typically requiring us to obtain approval from local government agencies prior to tower construction subject to certain exceptions structural enhancements may be undertaken on behalf of a carrier without state or local planning approval under the general maintenance power under the australian telecommunications act 1997 although these enhancements may be subject to state and local planning laws if ccal is unable to obtain carrier cooperation to use such power for a limited number of towers ccal is also required to install aircraft warning lighting in compliance with federal aviation regulations in australia a carrier may arguably be able to utilize the maintenance power under the australian telecommunications act 1997 to remain as a tenant on a tower after the expiration of a site license or sublease however ccals customer access agreements generally limit the ability of customers to do this and even if a carrier did utilize this power the carrier would be required to pay for ccals financial loss which would roughly equal the site rental revenues that would have otherwise been payable 

local regulations  in australia there are various local state and territory laws and regulations which relate to among other things town planning and zoning restrictions standards or approvals for the design construction or alteration of a structure or facility or environmental regulations as in the us these laws vary greatly but typically require tower owners to obtain approval from governmental bodies prior to tower construction and to comply with environmental laws on an ongoing basis 




 item 1a risk factors 

you should carefully consider all of the risks described below as well as the other information contained in this document when evaluating your investment in our securities 

risks relating to our business 

our business depends on the demand for wireless communication services and wireless infrastructure and we may be adversely affected by any slowdown in such demand additionally a reduction in carrier network investment may materially and adversely affect our business including reducing demand for new tenant additions or network services 

demand for our wireless infrastructure depends on the demand for antenna space from our customers which in turn depends on the demand for wireless communication services by their customers the willingness of our customers to utilize our wireless infrastructure or renew or extend existing leases on our wireless infrastructure is affected by numerous factors including 

  7 

to our wireless infrastructure or 2 resulting in the obsolescence or decommissioning of certain existing wireless networks or 

 a slowdown in demand for wireless communication services or our wireless infrastructure may negatively impact our growth or otherwise have a material adverse effect on us if our customers or potential customers are unable to raise adequate capital to fund their business plans as a result of disruptions in the financial and credit markets or otherwise they may reduce their spending which could adversely affect our anticipated growth or the demand for our wireless infrastructure or network services 

historically the amount of our customers network investment is cyclical and has varied based upon the various matters described in these risk factors changes in carrier network investment typically impact the demand for our wireless infrastructure as a result changes in carrier plans such as delays in the implementation of new systems new technologies including with respect to the use of small cells or plans to expand coverage or capacity may reduce demand for our wireless infrastructure furthermore the wireless communication services industry could experience a slowdown or slowing growth rates as a result of numerous factors including a reduction in consumer demand for wireless services or general economic conditions there can be no assurances that weakness or uncertainty in the economic environment will not adversely impact the wireless communication services industry which may materially and adversely affect our business including by reducing demand for our wireless infrastructure or network services in addition a slowdown may increase competition for site rental customers or network services a wireless communication services industry slowdown or a reduction in carrier network investment may materially and adversely affect our business for a further discussion of our risks relating to network services see  —our network services business has historically experienced significant volatility in demand which reduces the predictability of our results below 

a substantial portion of our revenues is derived from a small number of customers and the loss consolidation or financial instability of any of our limited number of customers may materially decrease revenues or reduce demand for our wireless infrastructure and network services 

for 2014  approximately 88  of our consolidated site rental revenues were derived from att sprint tmobile and verizon wireless which represented 29  22  22  and 15  respectively of our consolidated site rental revenues for such period the loss of any one of our large customers as a result of consolidation merger bankruptcy insolvency network sharing roaming joint development resale agreements by our customers or otherwise may result in 1 a material decrease in our revenues 2 uncollectible account receivables 3 an impairment of our deferred site rental receivables wireless infrastructure assetsintangible assets or 4 other adverse effects to our business we cannot guarantee that leases with our major customers will not be terminated or that these customers will renew their leases with us in addition to our four largest customers in the us we also derive a portion of our revenues and anticipated future growth from new entrants offering or contemplating offering wireless services such customers may be smaller or have less financial resources than our four largest customers have business models which may not be successful or may require additional capital see also item 1 business—the company  and note 15  to our consolidated financial statements 

consolidation among our customers will likely result in duplicate or overlapping parts of networks for example where they are coresidents on a tower which may result in the termination or nonrenewal of tenant leases and impact revenues from our wireless infrastructure we expect that any termination of tenant leases as a result of this potential consolidation would be spread over multiple years in addition consolidation may result in a reduction in such customers future capital expenditures in the aggregate because their expansion plans may be similar wireless carrier consolidation could decrease the demand for our wireless infrastructure which in turn may result in a reduction in our revenues or cash flows see item 7 mda—general overview  for further discussion of our customers network enhancement deployments 

based on sprints stated intention to decommission its iden network and our contractual terms with sprint we expect our site rental revenues to be impacted by 60 million to 70 million in 2015 these iden leases have effective termend dates spread throughout 2014 and 2015 the impact of the iden network decommissioning is included as a component of nonrenewals of tenant leases as referenced herein 

additionally during 2015 we expect site rental revenues to be impacted by nonrenewals of 35 million to 45 million as a result of the decommissioning of the acquired networks over the last two years att tmobile and sprint acquired leap wireless metropcs and clearwire respectively the acquired networks represented approximately 10  of our net revenues for the year ended december 31 2014 we currently expect potential nonrenewals from the decommissioning of the acquired networks to be approximately 60 of current runrate site rental revenues related to the acquired networks with the majority of such nonrenewals to occur predominately from 2015 through 2018 depending on the eventual network deployment and decommissioning plans of att tmobile and sprint the impact and timing of such nonrenewals may vary from our expectations

our substantial level of indebtedness could adversely affect our ability to react to changes in our business and the terms of our debt instruments and convertible preferred stock limit our ability to take a number of actions that our management might otherwise believe to be in our best interests in addition if we fail to comply with our covenants our debt could be accelerated 

as a result of our substantial indebtedness 

 currently we have debt instruments in place that limit in certain circumstances our ability to incur additional indebtedness pay dividends create liens sell assets or engage in certain mergers and acquisitions among other things in addition the credit agreement governing our senior secured credit facility agreement 2012 credit facility contains financial maintenance covenants our ability to comply with these covenants or to satisfy our debt obligations will depend on our future operating performance if we violate the restrictions in our debt instruments or fail to comply with our financial maintenance covenants we will be in default under those instruments which in some cases would cause the maturity of a substantial portion of our longterm indebtedness to be accelerated furthermore if the limits on our ability to pay dividends prevent us from satisfying our reit distribution requirements we could fail to remain qualified for taxation as a reit if these limits do not jeopardize our qualification for taxation as a reit but nevertheless prevent us from distributing 100 of our reit taxable income we will be subject to federal and state corporate income taxes and potentially a nondeductible excise tax on the retained amounts if our operating subsidiaries were to default on the debt the trustee could seek to foreclose the collateral securing such debt in which case we could lose the wireless infrastructure and the revenues associated with the wireless infrastructure see item 7 mda—liquidity and capital resources—debt covenants  for a further discussion of our debt covenants 

ccic and ccoc are holding companies that conduct all of their operations through their subsidiaries accordingly ccics and ccocs respective sources of cash to pay interest or principal on their outstanding indebtedness are distributions relating to their respective ownership interests in their subsidiaries from the net earnings and cash flows generated by such subsidiaries or from proceeds of debt or equity offerings earnings and cash flows generated by their subsidiaries are first applied by such subsidiaries to conduct their operations including servicing their respective debt obligations after which any excess cash flows generally may be paid to such holding company in the absence of any special conditions such as a continuing event of default however their subsidiaries are legally distinct from the holding companies and unless they guarantee such debt have no obligation to pay amounts due on their debt or to make funds available to us for such payment 

if we fail to pay scheduled dividends on the convertible preferred stock in cash common stock or any combination of cash and common stock we will be prohibited from paying dividends on our common stock which may jeopardize our status as a reit 

we have a substantial amount of indebtedness in the event we do not repay or refinance such indebtedness we could face substantial liquidity issues and might be required to issue equity securities or securities convertible into equity securities or sell some of our assets to meet our debt payment obligations 

we have a substantial amount of indebtedness approximately 119 billion  as of december 31 2014  which we will need to refinance or repay see item 7 mda—liquidity and capital resources  for a tabular presentation of our contractual debt maturities there can be no assurances we will be able to refinance our indebtedness 1 on commercially reasonable terms 2 on terms including with respect to interest rates as favorable as our current debt or 3 at all 

economic conditions and the credit markets have historically experienced and may continue to experience periods of volatility uncertainty or weakness that could impact the availability or cost of debt financing including with respect to any 

 9 

refinancing of the obligations described above or on our ability to draw the full amount of our 22 billion  revolving credit facility 2012 revolver that as of february 13 2015  has 15 billion  of undrawn availability 

if we are unable to repay or refinance our debt we cannot guarantee that we will be able to generate enough cash flows from operations or that we will be able to obtain enough capital to service our debt fund our planned capital expenditures or pay future dividends in such an event we could face substantial liquidity issues and might be required to issue equity securities or securities convertible into equity securities or sell some of our assets to meet our debt payment obligations failure to repay or refinance indebtedness when required could result in a default under such indebtedness if we incur additional indebtedness any such indebtedness could exacerbate the risks described above 

sales or issuances of a substantial number of shares of our common stock may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

future sales or issuances of common stock or other equity related securities may adversely affect the market price of our common stock including any shares of our common stock issued to finance capital expenditures finance acquisitions or repay debt our business strategy contemplates access to external financing to fund certain discretionary investments which may include issuances of common stock or other equity related securities as of february 13 2015  we had 3339 million  shares of common stock outstanding in addition we reserved 125 million and 135 million of shares of common stock respectively for issuance in connection with awards granted under our various stock compensation plans and our convertible preferred stock the dividends on our convertible preferred stock may also be paid in cash or subject to certain limitations shares of common stock or any combination of cash and shares of common stock 

in addition a small number of common stockholders own a significant percentage of our outstanding common stock if any one of these common stockholders or any group of our common stockholders sells a large quantity of shares of our common stock or the public market perceives that existing common stockholders might sell a large quantity of shares of our common stock the market price of our common stock may significantly decline 

as a result of competition in our industry including from some competitors with significantly more resources or less debt than we have we may find it more difficult to achieve favorable rental rates on our new or renewing customer contracts 

our growth is dependent on our entering into new tenant leases including amendments to leases upon modification of an existing installation as well as renewing or renegotiating tenant leases when existing tenant leases terminate we face competition for site rental tenants from various sources including 

 our small cell operations may have different competitors than our traditional site rental business including other owners of small cells or fiber some of which have larger networks or greater financial resources than we have competition in our industry may make it more difficult for us to attract new customers maintain or increase our gross margins or maintain or increase our market share 

the business model for our small cell operations contains certain differences from our traditional site rental business resulting in different operational risks if we do not successfully operate that business model or identify or manage those operational risks such operations may produce results that are less than anticipated 

the business model for our small cell operations contains certain differences from our traditional tower operations including differences relating to customer contract terms landlord demographics ownership of certain network assets operational oversight requirements including requirements for service level agreements regarding network performance and maintenance and applicable laws while our small cell operations have certain risks that are similar to our tower operations they also have certain operational risks that are different from our traditional site rental business including the 1 use of competitive local exchange carrier which we refer to as clec status 2 use of public rightsofway 3 use of poles owned solely by or jointly with third parties or 4 risks relating to overbuilding in addition the rate at which wireless carriers adopt or prioritize small cells may be lower or slower than we anticipate our small cell operations will also expose us to different safety or liability risks or hazards than our traditional site rental business as a result of numerous factors including the location or nature of the assets involved because small cells are comparatively new technologies and are continuing to evolve there may be other risks related to small cells of which we are not yet aware 

 10 

new technologies may significantly reduce demand for our wireless infrastructure or negatively impact our revenues 

improvements in the efficiency of wireless networks could reduce the demand for our wireless infrastructure for example signal combining technologies that permit one antenna to service multiple frequencies and thereby multiple customers may reduce the need for our wireless infrastructure in addition other technologies such as wifi das femtocells other small cells or satellite such as low earth orbiting and mesh transmission systems may in the future serve as substitutes for or alternatives to leasing that might otherwise be anticipated or expected on wireless infrastructure had such technologies not existed any significant reduction in wireless infrastructure leasing demand resulting from the previously mentioned technologies or other technologies may negatively impact our revenues or otherwise have a material adverse effect on us 

new wireless technologies may not deploy or be adopted by customers as rapidly or in the manner projected 

there can be no assurances that new wireless services or technologies will be introduced or deployed as rapidly or in the manner projected by the wireless or broadcast industries in addition demand or customer adoption rates for such new technologies may be lower or slower than anticipated for numerous reasons as a result growth opportunities or demand for our wireless infrastructure as a result of such technologies may not be realized at the times or to the extent anticipated 

if we fail to retain rights to our wireless infrastructure including the land interests under our towers our business may be adversely affected 

our property interests relating to the land interests on which our towers reside consist of leasehold and subleasehold interests fee interests easements licenses and rightsofway a loss of these interests may interfere with our ability to conduct our business or generate revenues for various reasons we may not always have the ability to access analyze or verify all information regarding titles or other issues prior to purchasing wireless infrastructure further we may not be able to renew ground leases on commercially viable terms our ability to retain rights to the land interests on which our towers reside depends on our ability to purchase such land including fee interests and perpetual easements or renegotiate or extend the terms of the leases relating to such land approximately 12  of our site rental gross margins for the year ended december 31 2014  were derived from towers where the leases for the land interests under such towers had final expiration dates of less than ten years if we are unable to retain rights to the land interests on which our towers reside our business may be adversely affected 

as of december 31 2014 approximately 53  of our towers were leased or subleased or operated and managed under master leases subleases or other agreements with sprint tmobile and att we have the option to purchase these towers at the end of their respective lease terms we have no obligation to exercise such purchase options we may not have the required available capital to exercise our right to purchase some or all of these towers at the time these options are exercisable even if we do have available capital we may choose not to exercise our right to purchase these towers or some or all of the tmobile or att towers for business or other reasons in the event that we do not exercise these purchase rights or are otherwise unable to acquire an interest that would allow us to continue to operate these towers after the applicable period we will lose the cash flows derived from such towers which may have a material adverse effect on our business in the event that we decide to exercise these purchase rights the benefits of the acquisition of these towers may not exceed the costs which could adversely affect our business additional information concerning these towers and the applicable purchase options as of december 31 2014 is as follows 

  11 

under master lease or master prepaid lease arrangements we have with tmobile sprint and att certain of our subsidiaries lease or sublease or are otherwise granted the right to manage and operate towers from bankruptcy remote subsidiaries of such carriers if one of these bankruptcy remote subsidiaries nevertheless becomes a debtor in a bankruptcy proceeding and is permitted to reject the underlying ground lease our subsidiaries could lose their interest in the applicable sites if our subsidiaries were to lose their interest in the applicable sites or if the applicable ground leases were to be terminated we would lose the cash flow derived from the towers on those sites which may have a material adverse effect on our business we have similar bankruptcy risks with respect to sites that we operate under management agreements 

our network services business has historically experienced significant volatility in demand which reduces the predictability of our results 

the operating results of our network services business for any particular period may vary significantly and should not necessarily be considered indicative of longerterm results for this activity our network services business is generally driven by demand for our wireless infrastructure and may be adversely impacted by various factors including 

 the expansion or development of our business including through acquisitions increased product offerings or other strategic growth opportunities may cause disruptions in our business which may have an adverse effect on our business operations or financial results 

we seek to expand and develop our business including through acquisitions increased product offerings or other strategic growth opportunities in the ordinary course of our business we review analyze and evaluate various potential transactions or other activities in which we may engage such transactions or activities could cause disruptions in increase risk or otherwise negatively impact our business among other things such transactions and activities may 

 if we fail to comply with laws or regulations which regulate our business and which may change at any time we may be fined or even lose our right to conduct some of our business 

a variety of federal state local and foreign laws and regulations apply to our business including those discussed in item 1 business   failure to comply with applicable requirements may lead to civil penalties or require us to assume indemnification obligations or breach contractual provisions we cannot guarantee that existing or future laws or regulations including state and local tax laws will not adversely affect our business increase delays or result in additional costs these factors may have a material adverse effect on us 

if radio frequency emissions from wireless handsets or equipment on our wireless infrastructure are demonstrated to cause negative health effects potential future claims could adversely affect our operations costs or revenues 

the potential connection between radio frequency emissions and certain negative health effects including some forms of cancer has been the subject of substantial study by the scientific community in recent years we cannot guarantee that claims relating to radio frequency emissions will not arise in the future or that the results of such studies will not be adverse to us 

public perception of possible health risks associated with cellular or other wireless communication services may slow or diminish the growth of wireless companies which may in turn slow or diminish our growth in particular negative public perception of and regulations regarding these perceived health risks may slow or diminish the market acceptance of wireless communication services if a connection between radio frequency emissions and possible negative health effects were established our operations 

 12 

costs or revenues may be materially and adversely affected we currently do not maintain any significant insurance with respect to these matters 

certain provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation charter amended and restated bylaws bylaws and operative agreements and domestic and international competition laws may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us or for us to acquire control of a third party even if such a change in control would be beneficial to our stockholders 

we have a number of antitakeover devices in place that will hinder takeover attempts or may reduce the market value of our common stock our antitakeover provisions include 

 our bylaws permit special meetings of the stockholders to be called only upon the request of our chief executive officer or a majority of the board of directors and deny stockholders the ability to call such meetings such provisions as well as the provisions of section 203 of the delaware general corporation law may impede a merger consolidation takeover or other business combination or discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us 

in addition domestic or international competition laws may prevent or discourage us from acquiring wireless infrastructure in certain geographical areas or impede a merger consolidation takeover or other business combination or discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us 

we may be adversely affected by exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates relating to our operations in australia 

our australian operations expose us to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates for 2014  approximately 4  of our consolidated net revenues were denominated in australian dollars see item 7 mda—results of operations—comparison of operating segments  for a discussion of the effects of a change in the australian dollar to us dollar exchange rate we have not historically engaged in significant hedging activities relating to our australian operations and we may suffer future losses as a result of changes in currency exchange rates 

risks relating to our reit election 

future dividend payments to our stockholders will reduce the availability of our cash on hand available to fund future discretionary investments and may result in a need to incur indebtedness or issue equity securities to fund growth opportunities in such event the then current economic credit market or equity market conditions will impact the availability or cost of such financing which may hinder our ability to grow our per share results of operations 

during the first quarter of 2014 we commenced paying a quarterly cash dividend on our common stock in october 2014 we increased our quarterly cash dividend beginning in the fourth quarter of 2014 from an annual amount of 140 to 328 per share as such we declared quarterly cash dividends of 082 per share in each of october 2014 and february 2015 we currently expect such increased dividends to result in aggregate annual cash payments of approximately 11 billion during 2015 subject to the future approval of our board of directors over time we expect to increase our dividend per share generally commensurate with our realized growth in cash flows future dividends are subject to the approval of our board of directors see notes 11  and 18  to our consolidated financial statements 

effective january 1 2014 we commenced operating as a reit for us federal income tax purposes to remain qualified and be taxed as a reit we will generally be required to distribute at least 90 of our reit taxable income after the utilization of any available nols determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding net capital gain each year to our stockholders the increased common stock dividend will delay the utilization of our nols and may cause certain of the nols to expire without utilization see also item 7 mda—general overview—common stock dividend  and item 7 mda—general overview—reit election 

as discussed in item 1 mda—business—strategy  we seek to invest our capital including the net cash provided by our operating activities as well as external financing sources in a manner that will increase longterm stockholder value on a riskadjusted basis our historical discretionary investments have included the following in no particular order purchasing our common stock acquiring or constructing wireless infrastructure acquiring land interests under towers improving or structurally enhancing our existing wireless infrastructure or purchasing repaying or redeeming our debt external financing including debt equity and equityrelated issuances to fund future discretionary investments either 1 may not be available to us or 2 may not be accessible by us at terms that would result in the investment of the net proceeds raised yielding incremental growth in our per 

 13 

share operating results as a result future dividend payments may hinder our ability to grow our per share results of operations or otherwise adversely affect our ability to execute our business plan 

see also — if we fail to pay scheduled dividends on the convertible preferred stock in cash common stock or any combination of cash and common stock we will be prohibited from paying dividends on our common stock which may jeopardize our status as a reit  below  

remaining qualified to be taxed as a reit involves highly technical and complex provisions of the us internal revenue code failure to remain qualified as a reit would result in our inability to deduct dividends to stockholders when computing our taxable income which would reduce our available cash 

effective january 1 2014 we commenced operating as a reit for us federal tax purposes as a reit we are generally entitled to a deduction for dividends that we pay and therefore are not subject to us federal corporate income tax on our taxable income that is distributed to our common stockholders 

while we intend to operate so that we remain qualified as a reit given the highly complex nature of the rules governing reits the ongoing importance of factual determinations and the possibility of future changes in our circumstances no assurance can be given that we will qualify as a reit for any particular year 

if in any taxable year we fail to qualify for taxation as a reit and are not entitled to relief under the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended code then 

 although we may have federal nols available to reduce any taxable income to the extent our federal nols have been utilized or are otherwise unavailable any such corporate tax liability could be substantial would reduce the amount of cash available for other purposes and might necessitate the borrowing of additional funds or the liquidation of some investments to pay any additional tax liability accordingly funds available for investment would be reduced 

under the code no more than 25 of the value of the assets of a reit may be represented by securities of one or more trss or other nonqualifying assets this limitation may affect our ability to make additional investments in nonreit qualifying operations or assets or in any operations held through trss the net income of our trss is not required to be distributed to us and income that is not distributed to us generally will not be subject to the reit income distribution requirement however there may be limitations on our ability to accumulate earnings in our trss and the accumulation or reinvestment of significant earnings in our trss could result in adverse tax treatment in particular if the accumulation of cash in our trss causes the fair market value of our securities in our trss or certain other nonqualifying assets to exceed 25 of the fair market value of our assets at the end of any quarter then we may fail to remain qualified as a reit 

complying with reit requirements including the 90 distribution requirement may limit our flexibility or cause us to forgo otherwise attractive opportunities including certain discretionary investments and potential financing alternatives 

to remain qualified and be taxed as a reit we will generally be required to distribute at least 90 of our reit taxable income after the utilization of any available nols determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding net capital gain each year to our stockholders we commenced declaring regular quarterly cash dividends to our common stockholders beginning with the first quarter of 2014   see notes 11  and 18  to our consolidated financial statements any such dividends however are subject to the determination and approval of our board of directors based on thencurrent and anticipated future conditions including our earnings net cash provided by operating activities capital requirements financial condition our relative market capitalization our existing federal nols of approximately 22 billion of which approximately 19 billion are available to offset reit taxable income or other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors 

to the extent that we satisfy the 90 distribution requirement but distribute less than 100 of our reit taxable income after the application of available nols if any we will be subject to federal corporate income tax on our undistributed taxable income in addition we will be subject to a 4 nondeductible excise tax if the actual amount that we pay out to our stockholders for a calendar year is less than a minimum amount specified under the code 

 14 

from time to time we may generate reit taxable income greater than our cash flow as a result of differences in timing between the recognition of taxable income and the actual receipt of cash or the effect of nondeductible capital expenditures the creation of reserves or required debt or amortization payments if we do not have other funds available in these situations we could be required to borrow funds on unfavorable terms sell assets at disadvantageous prices or distribute amounts that would otherwise be invested in future acquisitions to make distributions sufficient to enable us to pay out enough of our taxable income to satisfy the reit dividend requirement and to avoid corporate income tax and the 4 excise tax in a particular year these alternatives could increase our costs or reduce our equity thus compliance with the reit requirements may hinder our ability to grow which could adversely affect the value of our common stock furthermore the reit dividend requirements may increase the financing we need to fund capital expenditures future growth or expansion initiatives which would increase our total leverage 

in addition to satisfying the distribution test to remain qualified as a reit for tax purposes we will need to continually satisfy tests concerning among other things the sources of our income the nature and diversification of our assets and the ownership of our capital stock compliance with these tests will require us to refrain from certain activities and may hinder our ability to make certain attractive investments including the purchase of nonqualifying assets the expansion of nonreal estate activities or investments in the businesses to be conducted by our trss and to that extent limit our opportunities and our flexibility to change our business strategy furthermore acquisition opportunities in domestic or international markets may be adversely affected if we need or require the target company to comply with some reit requirements prior to completing any such acquisition in addition our conversion to a reit may result in investor pressures not to pursue growth opportunities that are not immediately accretive 

moreover if we fail to comply with certain asset ownership tests at the end of any calendar quarter we must correct the failure within 30 days after the end of the calendar quarter or qualify for certain statutory relief provisions to avoid losing our reit qualification as a result we may be required to liquidate assets in adverse market conditions or forgo otherwise attractive investments these actions may reduce our income and amounts available for distribution to our stockholders 

if we fail to pay scheduled dividends on the convertible preferred stock in cash common stock or any combination of cash and common stock we will be prohibited from paying dividends on our common stock which may jeopardize our status as a reit 

the terms of the convertible preferred stock provide that unless accumulated dividends have been paid or set aside for payment on all outstanding convertible preferred stock for all past dividend periods no dividends may be declared or paid on our common stock if that were to occur the inability to pay dividends on our common stock might jeopardize our status as a reit for us federal income tax purposes see note 11  to our consolidated financial statements 

we have limited experience operating as a reit our failure to successfully operate as a reit may adversely affect our financial condition cash flow the per share trading price of our common stock or our ability to satisfy debt service obligations 

we have limited operating history as a reit in addition our senior management team has limited experience operating a reit we cannot assure you that our past experience will be sufficient to operate our company successfully as a reit including our ability to remain qualified as a reit failure to maintain reit status could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations cash flow or ability to satisfy debt service obligations 

reit related ownership limitations and transfer restrictions may prevent or restrict certain transfers of our capital stock 

in order for us to continue to satisfy the requirements for reit qualification our capital stock must be beneficially owned by 100 or more persons during at least 335 days of a taxable year of 12 months or during a proportionate part of a shorter taxable year other than the first year for which an election to be a reit has been made also not more than 50 of the value of the outstanding shares of our capital stock may be owned directly or indirectly by five or fewer “individuals” as defined in the code to include certain entities such as private foundations during the last half of a taxable year other than the first taxable year for which an election to be a reit has been made in order to facilitate compliance with the reit rules our charter includes provisions that implement reitrelated ownership limitations and transfer restrictions that generally prohibit any person as defined in our charter from beneficially or constructively owning or being deemed to beneficially or constructively own by virtue of the attribution provisions of the code more than 98 by value or number of shares whichever is more restrictive of the outstanding shares of our common stock or 98 in aggregate value of the outstanding shares of all classes and series of our capital stock including our common stock and any shares of our convertible preferred stock in addition our charter provides for certain other ownership limitations and transfer restrictions under applicable constructive ownership rules any shares of capital stock owned by certain affiliated owners generally would be added together for purposes of the ownership limitations these ownership limitations and transfer restrictions could have the effect of delaying deferring or preventing a transaction or a change in control of our company that might involve a premium price for our capital stock or otherwise might be in the best interest of our stockholders

reit election 

effective january 1 2014 we commenced operating as a reit for us federal income tax purposes as a reit we are generally entitled to a deduction for dividends that we pay and therefore are not subject to us federal corporate income tax on our taxable income that is distributed to our stockholders we also may be subject to certain federal state local and foreign taxes on our income or assets including 1 alternative minimum taxes 2 taxes on any undistributed income 3 taxes related to the trss 4 state local or foreign income taxes 5 franchise taxes 6 property taxes and 7 transfer taxes in addition we could in certain circumstances be required to pay an excise or penalty tax which could be significant in amount in order to utilize one or more relief provisions under the code to maintain qualification for taxation as a reit 

our small cells are currently included in one or more wholly owned trss in august 2014 we received a favorable private letter ruling from the irs which provides that the real property portion of our small cells and the related rents qualify as real property and rents from real property respectively under the rules governing reits we are evaluating the impact of this private letter ruling and subject to board approval we expect to take appropriate action to include at least some part of our small cells as part of the reit during 2015 once we have completed our evaluation and necessary actions to include small cells in the reit we expect to derecognize our net deferred tax liabilities related to such part of our small cells 

additionally we have included in trss our tower operations in australia and certain other assets and operations those trs assets and operations along with any part of our small cells that may remain in a trs will continue to be subject as applicable to federal and state corporate income taxes or to foreign taxes in the jurisdictions in which such assets and operations are located our foreign assets and operations including our tower operations in puerto rico and australia most likely will be subject to foreign income taxes in the jurisdictions in which such assets and operations are located regardless of whether they are included in a trs or not 

to remain qualified and be taxed as a reit we will generally be required to distribute at least 90 of our reit taxable income after the utilization of our nols determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding net capital gain each year to our stockholders see notes 2 and 10  to our consolidated financial statements 

in connection with completing the steps necessary to qualify to operate as a reit in december 2013 we derecognized the net deferred tax assets and liabilities related to the entities included in the reit resulting in a corresponding net noncash income tax charge of 674 million the derecognition of the deferred tax assets and liabilities was recorded upon completion of all necessary actions to qualify as a reit and receipt of final approval from our board of directors 

in october 2014 we increased our quarterly common stock cash dividend beginning in the fourth quarter of 2014 from an annual amount of 140 to 328 per share the increased common stock dividend will delay the utilization of our nols and may cause certain of the nols to expire without utilization see note 10  to our consolidated financial statements and item 1a risk factors  for additional information concerning our reit election

ccusa— 2014  and 2013   see note 3  in our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the impact of the 2012 acquisitions and the att acquisition 

net revenues for 2014   increased  by 6730 million  or 23  from 2013  this increase  in net revenues resulted from an increase  in 1 site rental revenues of 4952 million  or 21  and 2 network services and other revenues of 1778 million  or 36  in each case as compared to 2013  the att acquisition increased our site rental revenues for 2014 compared to 2013 as discussed in item 7 mda—overview this increase  in site rental revenues was also impacted by the following items inclusive of straightline accounting in no particular order new tenant additions across our entire portfolio renewals or extensions of tenant leases escalations construction of new wireless infrastructure other acquisitions and nonrenewals of tenant leases tenant additions were influenced by our customers upgrading to lte and their ongoing efforts to improve network quality and capacity see also item 1 business—the company—ccusa   

site rental gross margins for 2014   increased  by 2760 million  or 16  from 2013  the increase  in the site rental gross margins was related to the previously mentioned 21   increase  in site rental revenues primarily as a result of the att acquisition which had lower initial margins due to lower average tenancy that the average tenancy for our other wireless infrastructure and the growth in our site rental activities 

network services and other revenues for 2014 increased 1778 million  or 36  from 2013 and is a reflection of 1 the volume of activity from carrier network enhancements such as lte upgrades 2 changes in volume and mix and 3 the expansion in size of our wireless infrastructure portfolio due to the tmobile acquisition and att acquisition our network services offering is of a variable nature as these revenues are not under longterm contracts network services and other gross margin for 2014   increased  by 815 million  or 43  from 2013  primarily as a result of the previously mentioned factors that increased network services and other revenues 

general and administrative expenses for 2014   increased  by 438 million  or 21  from 2013  and represented 7  of net revenues in both 2014  and 2013  general and administrative expenses are inclusive of stockbased compensation charges see also note 12  to our consolidated financial statements the increase  in general and administrative expenses in nominal dollars was commensurate with the growth in our business including 1 the expansion in size of our wireless infrastructure portfolio primarily due to acquisitions and 2 the growth in network services typically our general and administrative expenses do not significantly increase as a result of new tenant additions on our existing wireless infrastructure 

 26 

adjusted ebitda for 2014   increased  by 3355 million  or 20  from 2013  adjusted ebitda was positively impacted by the att acquisition and the growth in our site rental and network services activities 

depreciation amortization and accretion for 2014   increased  by 2444 million  or 33  from 2013  this increase  predominately resulted from the fixed asset and intangible asset additions recorded related to the att acquisition 

interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs decreased  by 163 million  or 3  from 2013  to 2014  as a result of our refinancing activities partially offset by additional borrowings under the 2012 credit facility to partially fund the att acquisition during 2014 we issued 8500 million of 4875 senior notes which provided us with funding to 1 repay 3000 million of the january 2010 tower revenue notes and 2 redeem all of the previously outstanding 7125 senior notes in 2013 and 2014 we completed several debt transactions resulting in 1 lowering our average cost of debt 2 funding for our acquisitions 3 the refinancing of certain of our debt and 4 the extension of certain of our debt maturities as a result of repaying and redeeming certain of our debt we incurred net losses of 446 million  and 371 million  for 2014 and 2013 respectively for a further discussion of the debt refinancings see note 7  to our consolidated financial statements item 7 mda—liquidity and capital resources  and item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

our acquisition and integration expenses for 2014  and 2013  were 341 million  and 256 million  respectively and related to our 2012 and 2013 acquisitions see note 3  to our consolidated financial statements 

the benefit provision for income taxes for 2014  was a benefit of 112 million  compared to a provision of 1910 million for 2013  for 2014 the effective tax rate differed from the federal statutory rate predominately due to our reit status including the dividends paid deduction for 2013 the effective tax rate differed from the federal statutory rate predominately due to the derecognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities related to our reit election resulting in a noncash income tax charge of  674 million  see item 7 mda—accounting and reporting matters—critical accounting policies and estimates  and note 10  to our consolidated financial statements 

net income loss attributable to ccic stockholders for 2014  was income of 3613 million  compared to income of 765 million  for 2013  the increase  in net income was predominately due to a change in our benefit provision for income taxes due to our reit status as further discussed herein 

dividends on preferred stock for 2014  and 2013  represented the dividends related to our convertible preferred stock 

ccal— 2014  and 2013   the increases and decreases between 2014  and 2013  were inclusive of exchange rate fluctuations the average exchange rate of australian dollars expressed in us dollars for 2014  was approximately 09028  a decrease of approximately 7  from approximately 09687  for the same period in the prior year see item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

net revenues for 2014   decreased  by 55 million  or 4  from 2013  due to the negative impact from the aforementioned change in exchange rates and a decrease in network services and other revenues partially offset by growth in site rental revenues site rental revenues site rental gross margins and adjusted ebitda increased from 2013 to 2014 by 6  8  and 9  inclusive of the negative impact from the aforementioned change in exchange rates site rental revenues exclusive of the impact from exchange rates were also impacted by various other factors inclusive of straightline accounting including in no particular order tenant additions on our wireless infrastructure renewals of tenant leases acquisitions escalations and nonrenewal of tenant leases 

net income loss attributable to ccic stockholders for 2014  was income of 292 million  compared to income of 136 million  for 2013  the net income attributable to ccic stockholders was impacted by an income tax benefit of 113 million due to a resolution with taxing authorities in 2014 

ccusa— 2013  and 2012    see note 3  to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the impact of the 2012 acquisitions and the att acquisition 

net revenues for 2013   increased  by 5794 million  or 25  from 2012  this increase  in net revenues resulted in part from an increase  in 1 site rental revenues of 3703 million  or 19  and 2 network services and other revenues of 2091 million  or 73  in each case as compared to 2012  

this increase  in site rental revenues was impacted by the following items inclusive of straightline accounting in no particular order new tenant additions across our entire portfolio renewals or extensions of tenant leases escalations other acquisitions and nonrenewals of tenant leases the 2012 acquisitions and the att acquisition also increased our site rental net revenues from 2012 to 2013 by 14 based on initial run rate revenues from these acquisitions see item 7 mda—accounting and reporting matters—critical accounting policies and estimates  for a further discussion of our revenue recognition policies tenant additions 

 27 

were influenced by our customers upgrading to lte and their ongoing efforts to improve network quality and capacity see also item 1 business—the company—ccusa 

site rental gross margins for 2013   increased  by 1871 million  or 12  from 2012  the increase  in site rental gross margins was related to the previously mentioned 19  increase  in site rental revenues site rental gross margins for 2013   increased  primarily as a result of 1 the high incremental margins associated with tenant additions given the relatively fixed costs to operate wireless infrastructure and 2 acquisitions the 1871 million  incremental margin represents 51  of the related increase  in site rental revenues inclusive of the impact of acquisitions 

network services and other gross margin for 2013 increased  by 787 million  or 71  from 2012  the increase  in our gross margin from our network services and other revenues is a reflection of the volume of activity from carrier network enhancements such as lte upgrades the increase in our market share and the general volatility in the volume and mix of such work our network services offering is of a variable nature as these revenues are not under longterm leases 

general and administrative expenses for 2013   increased  by 286 million  or 15  from 2012  but decreased to 7  of net revenues in 2013  from 8  of net revenues in 2012  general and administrative expenses are inclusive of stockbased compensation charges see also note 12  to our consolidated financial statements the increase in general and administrative expenses in nominal dollars was commensurate with the growth in our business as a result of acquisitions typically our general and administrative expenses do not significantly increase as a result of adding additional tenants on our wireless infrastructure 

adjusted ebitda for 2013  increased by 2358 million or 16 from 2012  adjusted ebitda was positively impacted by the growth in our site rental and network services activities and the 2012 acquisitions 

depreciation amortization and accretion for 2013   increased  by 1499 million  or 25  from 2012  the increase  predominately resulted from the fixed asset and intangible asset additions related to the nextg acquisition and the tmobile acquisition 

interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs decreased 114 million or 2 from 2012 to 2013 as a result of our refinancings during 2012 and 2013 partially offset by additional borrowings to fund the 2012 acquisitions and the att acquisition during 2012 and 2013 we completed several debt transactions resulting in 1 lowering our average cost of debt 2 funding for our acquisitions 3 the refinancing of certain of our debt and 4 the extension of certain of our debt maturities 

as a result of our debt transactions we incurred a net loss of 371 million  for 2013  inclusive of 1 noncash losses of 11 million resulting from the writeoff of deferred financing costs and discounts and 2 cash losses of 360 million including with respect to make whole payments during 2012 as a result of repurchasing and redeeming certain of our debt we incurred a net loss of 1320 million inclusive of 1 noncash losses of 481 million resulting from the writeoff of deferred financing costs and discounts and 2 cash losses of 839 million including with respect to make whole payments 

our acquisition and integration expenses for 2012 and 2013 predominately related to the 2012 acquisitions and the att acquisition see note 3  to our consolidated financial statements 

the benefit provision for income taxes for 2013  was a provision of 1910 million  compared to a benefit of 601 million for 2012 for 2013 the effective tax rate differed from the federal statutory rate predominately due to the derecognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities related to our reit election resulting in a noncash income tax charge of 674 million for 2012 the effective tax rate differed from the federal statutory rate predominately due to the valuation allowance reversal of 1152 million resulting from 1 the nextg acquisition and 2 our determination to reverse a portion of the valuation allowance based upon our consideration of our recent historical trends and anticipated future taxable income see item 7 mda—accounting and reporting matters—critical accounting policies and estimates  and note 10  in our consolidated financial statements 

net income loss attributable to ccic stockholders for 2013  was income of 765 million  compared to income of 1446 million  for 2012  the decrease  in net income was predominately due to a change in our benefit provision for income taxes as discussed above partially offset by 1 the growth in our existing business 2 a decrease in interest expense and 3 a decrease in the net losses on the retirement of debt 

dividends on preferred stock for 2013 represented the dividends related to our convertible preferred stock 

ccal— 2013  and 2012   the increases and decreases between 2013  and 2012  are inclusive of exchange rate fluctuations the average exchange rate of australian dollars expressed in us dollars for 2013  was approximately 09687 a decrease of approximately 6 from approximately 1036 for the same period in the prior year see item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

net revenues for 2013   increased  by 103 million  or 7  from 2012  site rental revenues for 2013   increased  by 91 million  or 7  from 2012  the decrease in the exchange rate negatively impacted net revenues by 7 in 2013  from 2012  site rental revenues were also impacted by various other factors inclusive of straightline accounting including in no particular order tenant additions on our wireless infrastructure renewals of tenant leases acquisitions escalations and nonrenewals of tenant leases 

site rental gross margins for 2013   increased  by 64 million  or 7  from 2012  and adjusted ebitda for 2013  increased by 57 million or 8 from 2012  the increase  in the site rental gross margin and adjusted ebitda were primarily due to the same factors that drove the increase in net revenues 

net income loss attributable to ccic stockholders for 2013  was income of 136 million  compared to income of 440 million  for 2012  inclusive of income tax benefit of 399 million resulting from the reversals of the valuation allowance related to deferred tax assets in addition to the valuation allowance reversal net income was favorably impacted by the growth in the site rental business 

liquidity and capital resources 

overview 

general  our core business generates revenues under longterm leases see item 7 mda—general overview—overview  predominately from the largest us wireless carriers our strategy is to create longterm stockholder value via a combination of 1 growing cash flows generated from our portfolio of wireless infrastructure 2 returning a meaningful portion of our cash provided by operating activities to our stockholders in the form of dividends and 3 investing capital efficiently to grow longterm dividends per share we measure our efforts to create longterm stockholder value by the combined payment of dividends to stockholders and growth in our per share results see item 1 business—strategy  for a further discussion of our strategy 

we have and expect to continue to engage in discretionary investments that we believe will maximize longterm stockholder value our historical discretionary investments include in no particular order purchasing our common stock acquiring or constructing wireless infrastructure acquiring land interests under towers improving and structurally enhancing our existing wireless infrastructure and purchasing repaying or redeeming our debt based on recent small cell activity we expect to spend an increased percentage of our discretionary investments on the construction of new small cell networks we seek to fund our discretionary investments with both net cash provided by operating activities and cash available from financing capacity such as the use of our undrawn availability from the 2012 revolver debt financings and issuances of equity or equity related securities 

we seek to maintain a capital structure that we believe drives longterm stockholder value and optimizes our weightedaverage cost of capital we target a leverage ratio of approximately four to five times adjusted ebitda and interest coverage of approximately three times adjusted ebitda subject to various factors such as the availability and cost of capital and the potential longterm return on our discretionary investments we may choose to increase or decrease our leverage or coverage from these targets for various periods of time 

effective january 1 2014 we commenced operating as a reit for us federal income tax purposes we expect to continue to pay minimal cash income taxes as a result of our recent reit conversion and our nols see item 7 mda—general overview  and note 10  to our consolidated financial statements

 summary cash flows information   



operating activities 

the increase in net cash provided by operating activities for 2014  from 2013  was due primarily to 1 the att acquisition 2 growth in our core business including a net benefit from changes in working capital and 3 growth in our network services the increase in net cash provided by operating activities for 2013 from 2012 was due primarily to 1 growth in our core business including the 2012 acquisitions and net benefit from changes in working capital and 2 growth in our network services changes in working capital including changes in accounts receivable deferred site rental receivables deferred rental revenues prepaid ground leases restricted cash and accrued interest can have a significant impact on net cash provided by operating activities largely due to the timing of prepayments and receipts we expect to grow our net cash provided by operating activities in the future exclusive of movements in working capital if we realize expected growth in our core business 

investing activities 

capital expenditures  we categorize our capital expenditures as sustaining or discretionary sustaining capital expenditures include capitalized costs related to 1 maintenance activities on our wireless infrastructure which are generally related to replacements and upgrades that extend the life of the asset 2 vehicles 3 information technology equipment and 4 office equipment and facility improvements discretionary capital expenditures which we also commonly refer to as revenuegenerating capital expenditures include 1 purchases of land interests under towers 2 wireless infrastructure improvements and structural enhancements in order to support additional site rentals and 3 the construction of wireless infrastructure 

a summary of our capital expenditures for the last three years is as follows   



the increase in sustaining capital expenditures in 2014 was due primarily to the expansion of our office facilities our discretionary capital expenditures are made with respect to activities which we believe exhibit sufficient potential to enhance long 

 30 

term stockholder value we expect to continue to invest in capital expenditures sustaining and discretionary over the next 12 months at levels equal or greater than current levels our decisions regarding capital expenditures are influenced by the availability and cost of capital and expected returns on alternative uses of cash such as payments of dividends and investments the following is a discussion of certain aspects of our capital expenditures 

 acquisitions acquisitions consist of the acquisition of businesses such as towers small cells and third party land sites see notes 3  and 5  to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the att acquisition and the 2012 acquisitions 

financing activities 

we seek to allocate cash generated by our operations in a manner that will enhance longterm stockholder value which may include various financing activities such as in no particular order paying dividends on our common stock currently expected to total an aggregate of approximately  11 billion  during 2015 subject to future approval by our board of directors paying dividends on our convertible preferred stock expected to be approximately 45 million in 2015 purchasing our common stock or purchasing repaying or redeeming our debt see note 11   to our consolidated financial statements 

in 2013 our financing activities predominately related to our october 2013 equity financings and our 2012 credit facility borrowings and amendments in 2014 our financing activities predominately related to 1 paying an aggregate of 6243 million  in dividends on our common stock 2 amending our 2012 credit facility and 3 issuing  8500 million  of 4875 senior notes due in april 2022 which provided us with funding to repay  3000 million  of january 2010 tower revenue notes and redeem all of the previously outstanding 7125 senior notes see item 7 mda—liquidity and capital resources—overview and note 7  to our consolidated financial statements 

incurrence of debt and other obligations   see note 7  to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our issuances of debt during 2013  and 2014  which extended the maturities of our debt portfolio provided funding for our acquisitions and our retirement and redemption of previously existing debt and lowered our cost of debt see item 7 mda—liquidity and capital resources—overview—liquidity position highlights of the security for our debt is as follows 

 debt purchases and repayments  see note 7  to our consolidated financial statements for a summary of our repurchases redemptions and repayments of debt during 2013 and 2014 

common stock as of december 31 2014  2013  and 2012  we had 3339 million  3341 million  and 2932 million  common shares outstanding respectively in october 2013 we issued 414 million shares of common stock the net proceeds of which were used to partially fund the att acquisition during the year ended december 31 2014 we paid an aggregate of 6243 million  in dividends on our common stock see item 1 business—strategy  and note 11  to our consolidated financial statements 

preferred stock in october 2013 we issued 98 million shares of convertible preferred stock the net proceeds of which were used to partially fund the att acquisition unless converted earlier each outstanding share of the convertible preferred stock will automatically convert on november 1 2016 currently each share of convertible preferred stock will convert into between 11080  and 13850  shares of common stock depending on the applicable market value of the common stock and subject to certain antidilution adjustments at any time prior to november 1 2016 holders of the convertible preferred stock may elect to convert all or a portion of their shares into common stock at the minimum conversion rate of 11080  subject to certain antidilution adjustments 

revolving credit facility  our 2012 credit facility consists of 1 our 2012 revolver and 2 term loan facilities 2012 term loans 

 31 

 restricted cash  pursuant to the indentures governing certain of our operating companies debt securities all rental cash receipts of the issuers of these debt instruments and their subsidiaries are restricted and held by an indenture trustee the restricted cash in excess of required reserve balances is subsequently released to us in accordance with the terms of the indentures during 2012 3166 million of restricted cash was held by the trustee in connection with the redemption of the 775 secured notes that amount was subsequently released in january 2013 when the 775 secured notes were redeemed in their entirety see also notes 2  and 7  to our consolidated financial statements 

contractual cash obligations 

the following table summarizes our contractual cash obligations as of december 31 2014  these contractual cash obligations relate primarily to our outstanding borrowings or lease obligations for land interests under our towers the debt maturities reflect contractual maturity dates and do not consider the impact of the principal payments that will commence following the anticipated repayment dates on the tower revenue notes see footnote b and the wcp securitized notes see footnote c   



 

  32 

contractual maturity dates in 2040 the full year 2014  excess cash flow of the issuers of the wcp securitized notes was approximately  80 million  we currently expect to refinance these notes on or prior to the respective anticipated repayment dates 

 the following table summarizes our rights to the land interests under our towers including renewal terms at our option as of december 31 2014  as of december 31 2014  the leases for land interests under our towers had an average remaining life of approximately 30  years weighted based on site rental gross margin see item 1a risk factors   



  

 debt covenants 

the credit agreement governing the 2012 credit facility contains financial maintenance covenants we are currently in compliance with these financial maintenance covenants and based upon our current expectations we believe we will continue to comply with these financial maintenance covenants in addition certain of our debt agreements also contain restrictive covenants that place restrictions on us and may limit our ability to among other things incur additional debt and liens purchase our securities make capital expenditures dispose of assets undertake transactions with affiliates make other investments pay dividends or distribute excess cash flow see note 7  to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our debt covenants see item 1a risk factors the following are ratios applicable to the financial maintenance covenants under the credit agreement governing our 2012 credit facility as of december 31 2014

accounting and reporting matters 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the following is a discussion of the accounting policies and estimates that we believe 1 are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations or 2 require our most difficult subjective or complex judgments often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain the critical accounting policies and estimates for 2014  are not intended to be a comprehensive list of our accounting policies and estimates see note 2  to our consolidated financial statements for a summary of our significant accounting policies in many cases the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by gaap in other cases management is required to exercise judgment in the application of accounting principles with respect to particular transactions 

revenue recognition   81  of our total revenue for 2014  consists of site rental revenues which are recognized on a monthly basis over the fixed noncancelable term of the relevant lease generally ranging from five to 15 years regardless of whether the payments from the tenant are received in equal monthly amounts if the payment terms call for fixed escalations as in fixed dollar or fixed percentage increases upfront payments or rent free periods the revenue is recognized on a straightline basis over the fixed noncancelable term of the lease when calculating our straightline rental revenues we consider all fixed elements of tenant contractual escalation provisions even if such escalation provisions contain a variable element such as an escalator tied to an inflationbased index in addition to a minimum to the extent we acquire belowmarket tenant leases for contractual interests with tenants on the acquired wireless infrastructure for example with respect to small cells we record deferred credits and amortize such deferred credits to site rental revenues over their estimated lease term since we recognize revenue on a straightline basis a portion of the site rental revenue in a given period represents cash collected or contractually collectible in other periods our assets related to straightline site rental revenues are included in other current assets and deferred site rental receivables net amounts billed or received prior to being earned are deferred and reflected in deferred revenues and other longterm liabilities see notes 2  and 6  to our consolidated financial statements 

we provide network services relating to our wireless infrastructure which represent approximately 19  of our total revenues for 2014  network services and other revenue relate to installation services and the following additional site development services relating to our wireless infrastructure site acquisition architectural and engineering zoning or permitting or network development related services network services revenues are recognized after completion of the applicable service we account for network services separately from the customers site rental 

see item 1 business—the company—ccusa  for a further discussion of our business 

accounting for acquisitions — general as described in  item 1 business  much of our wireless infrastructure has been acquired in various transactions from the four largest us wireless carriers or their predecessors through transactions consummated since 1999 we evaluate each of our acquisitions to determine if it should be accounted for as a business combination or as an acquisition of assets for our business combinations we allocate the purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair value at the date of acquisition any purchase price in excess of the net fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is allocated to goodwill see item 7 mda—accounting and reporting matters—accounting for acquisitions—valuation below 

the determination of the final purchase price allocation could extend over several quarters resulting in the use of preliminary estimates that are subject to adjustment until finalized such changes could have a significant impact on our financial statements and could result in retrospective changes in results reported for the acquired business in prior periods in accordance with gaap 

accounting for acquisitions — leases with respect to business combinations that include towers that we lease and operate such as the tmobile sprint and att leased and subleased towers we evaluate such agreements to determine treatment as capital or operating leases the evaluation of such agreements for capital or operating lease treatment includes consideration of each of the lease classification criteria under asc 8401025 namely 1 the transfer of ownership provisions 2 the existence of bargain purchase options 3 the length of the remaining lease term and 4 the present value of the minimum lease payments with respect to the att acquisition tmobile acquisition and the sprint towers acquired in the global signal acquisition we determined that the tower leases were capital leases and the underlying land leases were operating leases based upon the lease term criterion after considering the fragmentation criteria applicable under asc 8401025 to leases involving both land and buildings ie towers we determined that the fragmentation criteria was met and the tower leases could be accounted for as capital leases apart from the land leases which are accounted for as operating leases since 1 the fair value of the land in the aforementioned business combinations was greater than 25 of the total fair value of the leased property at inception and 2 the tower lease expirations occur beyond 75 of the estimated economic life of the tower assets 

accounting for acquisitions — valuation  as of december 31 2014  our largest asset was property and equipment which primarily consists of wireless infrastructure followed by goodwill and intangible assets approximately 52 billion  and 37 

 34 

billion  in net book value respectively our identifiable intangible assets predominately relate to the site rental contracts and customer relationships intangible assets see note 2  to our consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the nature and composition of the site rental contracts and customer relationships intangible assets 

the fair value of the vast majority of our assets and liabilities is determined by using either 

 the purchase price allocation requires subjective estimates that if incorrectly estimated could be material to our consolidated financial statements including the amount of depreciation amortization and accretion expense the most important estimates for measurement of tangible fixed assets are 1 the cost to replace the asset with a new asset and 2 the economic useful life after giving effect to age quality and condition the most important estimates for measurement of intangible assets are 1 discount rates and 2 timing and amount of cash flows including estimates regarding customer renewals and cancellations the most important estimates for measurement of above and belowmarket leases is the determination of 1 favorability or unfavorability to the current market terms and 2 applicable lease term including whether renewals or extensions should be measured with respect to business combinations that include towers that we lease and operate such as the tmobile sprint and att leased and subleased towers we evaluate such agreements to determine treatment as capital or operating leases and identification of any bargain purchase options 

we record the fair value of obligations to perform certain asset retirement activities including requirements pursuant to our ground leases or easements to remove wireless infrastructure or remediate the land upon which our wireless infrastructure resides in determining the fair value of these asset retirement obligations we must make several subjective and highly judgmental estimates such as those related to 1 timing of cash flows 2 future costs 3 discount rates and 4 the probability of enforcement to remove the towers or small cells or remediate the land see note 2  to our consolidated financial statements 

accounting for longlived assets — useful lives  we are required to make subjective assessments as to the useful lives of our tangible and intangible assets for purposes of determining depreciation amortization and accretion expense that if incorrectly estimated could be material to our consolidated financial statements depreciation expense for our property and equipment is computed using the straightline method over the estimated useful lives of our various classes of tangible assets the substantial portion of our property and equipment represents the cost of our wireless infrastructure which is depreciated with an estimated useful life equal to the shorter of 1 20 years or 2 the term of the lease including optional renewals for the land interests under the wireless infrastructure 

the useful life of our intangible assets is estimated based on the period over which the intangible asset is expected to benefit us and gives consideration to the expected useful life of other assets to which the useful life may relate we review the expected useful lives of our intangible assets on an ongoing basis and adjust if necessary amortization expense for intangible assets is computed using the straightline method over the estimated useful life of each of the intangible assets the useful life of the site rental contracts and customer relationships intangible assets is limited by the maximum depreciable life of the wireless infrastructure 20 years as a result of the interdependency of the wireless infrastructure and site rental contracts and customer relationships in contrast the site rental contracts and customer relationships are estimated to provide economic benefits for several decades because of the low rate of tenant cancellations and high rate of renewals experienced to date thus while site rental contracts and customer relationships are valued based upon the fair value of the site rental contracts and customer relationships which includes assumptions regarding both 1 tenants exercise of optional renewals contained in the acquired leases and 2 renewals of the acquired leases past the contractual term including exercisable options the site rental contracts are amortized over a period not to exceed 20 years as a result of the useful life being limited by the depreciable life of the wireless infrastructure 

accounting for longlived assets — impairment evaluation — intangibles  we review the carrying values of property and equipment intangible assets or other longlived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable we utilize the following dual grouping policy for purposes of determining the unit of account for testing impairment of the site rental contracts and customer relationships 

 we first pool site rental contracts and customer relationships intangible assets and property and equipment into portfolio groups for purposes of determining the unit of account for impairment testing because we view wireless infrastructure as portfolios and wireless infrastructure in a given portfolio and its related tenant leases are not largely independent of the other wireless 

 35 

infrastructure in the portfolio we reevaluate the appropriateness of the pooled groups at least annually this use of grouping is based in part on 1 our limitations regarding disposal of wireless infrastructure 2 the interdependencies of wireless infrastructure portfolios and 3 the manner in which wireless infrastructure is traded in the marketplace the vast majority of our site rental contracts and customer relationships intangible assets and property and equipment are pooled into the us owned wireless infrastructure group secondly and separately we pool site rental contracts and customer relationships by significant tenant or by tenant grouping for individually insignificant tenants as appropriate for purposes of determining the unit of account for impairment testing because we associate the value ascribed to site rental contracts and customer relationships intangible assets to the underlying contracts and related customer relationships acquired 

our determination that an adverse event or change in circumstance has occurred that indicates that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable will generally involve 1 a deterioration in an assets financial performance compared to historical results 2 a shortfall in an assets financial performance compared to forecasted results or 3 changes affecting the utility and estimated future demands for the asset when considering the utility of our assets we consider events that would meaningfully impact 1 our wireless infrastructure or 2 our customer relationships for example consideration would be given to events that impact 1 the structural integrity and longevity of our wireless infrastructure or 2 our ability to derive benefit from our existing customer relationships including events such as bankruptcy or insolvency or loss of a significant customer during 2014  there were no events or circumstances that caused us to review the carrying value of our intangible assets or property and equipment due in part to our assets performing consistently with or better than our expectations 

if the sum of the estimated future cash flows undiscounted from an asset or portfolio group significant tenant or tenant group for individually insignificant tenants as applicable is less than its carrying amount an impairment loss may be recognized if the carrying value were to exceed the undiscounted cash flows measurement of an impairment loss would be based on the fair value of the asset which is based on an estimate of discounted future cash flows the most important estimates for such calculations of undiscounted cash flows are 1 the expected additions of new tenants and equipment on our wireless infrastructure and 2 estimates regarding tenant cancellations and renewals of leases we could record impairments in the future if changes in longterm market conditions expected future operating results or the utility of the assets results in changes for our impairment test calculations which negatively impact the fair value of our property and equipment and intangible assets or if we changed our unit of account in the future 

when grouping assets into pools for purposes of impairment evaluation we also consider individual towers nodes and third party land interests within a grouping for which we currently have no tenants approximately 2  of our total towers currently have no tenants we continue to pay operating expenses on these towers in anticipation of obtaining tenants on these towers in the future primarily because of the individual tower site demographics we estimate based on current visibility potential tenants on approximately half of these towers to the extent we do not believe there are longterm prospects of obtaining tenants on an individual tower node or third party land interest and all other possible avenues for recovering the carrying value has been exhausted including sale of the asset we appropriately reduce the carrying value of such assets to fair value 

accounting for longlived assets — impairment evaluation — goodwill   nearly all of our goodwill is recorded at ccusa we test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis regardless of whether adverse events or changes in circumstances have occurred the annual test begins with goodwill and all intangible assets being allocated to applicable reporting units we then perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount if it is concluded that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount it is necessary to perform the twostep goodwill impairment test otherwise the twostep goodwill impairment test is not required our reporting units are the operating segments ccusa and ccal since segment management operates their respective wireless infrastructure portfolios as a single network 

we performed our most recent annual goodwill impairment test as of october 1 2014 which resulted in no impairments this assessment included consideration of our market capitalization which exceeded over three times the aggregate carrying amount of the reporting units as of december 31 2014  

deferred income taxes  effective january 1 2014 we commenced operating as a reit for us federal income tax purposes    our reit taxable income is generally not subject to federal and state income taxes as a result of the deduction for dividends paid and any usage of our remaining nols accordingly the only provision for federal income taxes for the year ended december 31 2014 relates to trss furthermore as a result of the deduction for dividends paid some or all of our nols related to our reit may expire without utilization see “item 7 mda—general overview—reit election  for a discussion of the impact of our reit election 

our trss will continue to be subject as applicable to federal and state income taxes and foreign taxes in the jurisdictions in which such assets and operations are located see “item 7 mda—general overview—reit election  for a discussion of the the private letter ruling we received in august 2014 regarding our small cells 

 36 

for our trss we record deferred income tax assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet related to events that impact our financial statements and tax returns in different periods in order to compute these deferred tax balances we first analyze the differences between the book basis and tax basis of our assets and liabilities referred to as temporary differences these temporary differences are then multiplied by current tax rates to arrive at the balances for the deferred income tax assets and liabilities a valuation allowance is provided on deferred tax assets that do not meet the more likely than not realization threshold we recognize a tax position if it is more likely than not it will be sustained upon examination the tax position is measured at the largest amount that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 

if our expectations about the future tax consequences of past events should prove to be inaccurate the balances of our deferred income tax assets and liabilities could require significant adjustments in future periods our ability to utilize our nols is dependent in part upon our having sufficient future earnings to utilize our nols before they expire if market conditions change materially and we determine that we will be unable to generate sufficient taxable income in the future to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards we would be required to record an additional valuation allowance which would reduce our earnings such adjustments could cause a material effect on our results of operations for the period of the adjustment the change in our valuation allowance has no effect on our cash flows for a further discussion of our benefit provision for income taxes and our reit conversion see item 7 mda—results of operations—comparison of operating segments  and note 10  to our consolidated financial statements 

accounting pronouncements 

recently adopted accounting pronouncements  no accounting pronouncements adopted during the year ended december 31 2014 had a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

recent accounting pronouncements not yet adopted in may 2014 the financial accounting standards board fasb released updated guidance regarding the recognition of revenue from contracts with customers exclusive of those contracts within lease accounting see note 2  to our consolidated financial statements 

nongaap financial measures 

our measurement of profit or loss currently used to evaluate the operating performance of our operating segments is earnings before interest taxes depreciation amortization and accretion as adjusted or adjusted ebitda our definition of adjusted ebitda is set forth in item 7 mda—results of operations—comparison of operating segments    our measure of adjusted ebitda may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies including companies in the tower sector and other similar providers of wireless infrastructure and is not a measure of performance calculated in accordance with gaap adjusted ebitda should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for operating income or loss net income or loss net cash provided by used for operating investing and financing activities or other income statement or cash flow statement data prepared in accordance with gaap 

we believe adjusted ebitda is useful to an investor in evaluating our operating performance because 

 our management uses adjusted ebitda 

  37 

 there are material limitations to using a measure such as adjusted ebitda including the difficulty associated with comparing results among more than one company including our competitors and the inability to analyze certain significant items including depreciation and interest expense that directly affect our net income or loss management compensates for these limitations by considering the economic effect of the excluded expense items independently as well as in connection with their analysis of net income loss 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

our primary exposures to market risks are related to changes in interest rates or foreign currency exchange rates which may adversely affect our results of operations and financial position we seek to manage exposure to changes in interest rates where economically prudent to do so by utilizing fixed rate debt we do not currently hedge against foreign currency exchange risks 

interest rate risk 

our interest rate risk relates primarily to the impact of interest rate movements on the following 

 potential refinancing of existing debt 

over the next 12 months we have no debt maturities other than principal payments on amortizing debt we have  5088 million  of debt that has anticipated repayment dates during 2015 while these anticipated repayment dates are not contractual maturity dates we expect to refinance this debt prior to the respective anticipated repayment dates as of december 31 2014  and december 31 2013  we had no interest rate swaps hedging any refinancings see below for a tabular presentation of our scheduled contractual debt maturities as of december 31 2014 and a discussion of anticipated repayment dates 

floating rate debt 

we manage our exposure to market interest rates on our existing debt by controlling the mix of fixed and floating rate debt as of december 31 2014  we had 42 billion  of floating rate debt which included  28 billion  of debt with a libor floor of 075 per annum as a result a hypothetical unfavorable fluctuation in market interest rates on our existing debt of 18 of a percent point over a 12month period would increase our interest expense by approximately 2 million when giving effect to our libor floor and would increase our interest expense by approximately 5 million exclusive of the impact of the libor floor as of december 31 2013 we had 39 billion  of floating rate debt which included  29 billion  of debt with a libor floor of 075 per annum 

potential future borrowings of incremental debt 

we typically do not hedge our exposure to interest rates on potential future borrowings of incremental debt for a substantial period prior to issuance see item 7 mda—liquidity and capital resources  regarding our liquidity strategy 

 38 

the following table provides information about our market risk related to changes in interest rates the future principal payments and weightedaverage interest rates are presented as of december 31 2014  these debt maturities reflect contractual maturity dates and do not consider the impact of the principal payments that will commence following the anticipated repayment dates of certain notes see footnotes c and d see note 7  to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our debt 



  

 

 39 

foreign currency risk 

the vast majority of our foreign currency risk is related to the australian dollar which is the functional currency of ccal ccal represented 4  and 5  respectively of our consolidated revenues and 5  and 4  respectively of our consolidated operating income for 2014  and 2013  see item 7 mda—results of operations—comparison of operating segments foreign exchange markets have recently been volatile and we expect foreign exchange markets to continue to be volatile over the near term we believe the risk related to our financial instruments exclusive of intercompany financing deemed a longterm investment denominated in australian dollars is not significant to our financial condition a hypothetical increase or decrease of 25 in australian dollar exchange rate would increase or decrease the fair value of our financial instruments by approximately 9 million

 item 1 business 

overview 

we own operate and lease shared wireless infrastructure including 1 towers and other structures such as rooftops collectively towers and to a lesser extent 2 distributed antenna systems das a type of small cell network small cells and 3 interests in land under third party towers in various forms third party land interests collectively wireless infrastructure our core business is providing access including space or capacity to our towers and to a lesser extent to our small cells and third party land interests via longterm contracts in various forms including license sublease and lease agreements collectively contracts our wireless infrastructure can accommodate multiple customers colocation for antennas or other equipment necessary for the transmission of signals for wireless communication devices we seek to increase our site rental revenues by adding more tenants on our wireless infrastructure which we expect to result in significant incremental cash flows due to our relatively fixed operating costs 

effective january 1 2014 we commenced operating as a reit for us federal income tax purposes see item 7 mda—general overview—reit election 

certain information concerning our business as of december 31 2013  is as follows 

 certain information concerning our customers and site rental contracts as of december 31 2013  is as follows 

 to a lesser extent we also provide certain network services relating to our wireless infrastructure primarily consisting of antenna installations or subsequent augmentations as well as additional site development services relating to our wireless infrastructure 

strategy 

our strategy is to translate anticipated demand for our wireless infrastructure into growth in our cash flows and longterm stockholder value we measure longterm stockholder value as the combined growth in our per share results and dividends to common stockholders the key elements of our strategy are to 

 1 

 our longterm strategy is based on our belief that additional demand for our wireless infrastructure will be created by the expected continued growth in the wireless communications industry which is predominately driven by the demand for wireless data services by consumers we believe that additional demand for wireless infrastructure will create future growth opportunities for us we believe that such demand for our wireless infrastructure will continue will result in organic growth of our cash flows due to new tenant additions on our existing wireless infrastructure and will create other growth opportunities for us such as demand for new wireless infrastructure 

2013  industry highlights and company developments 

see item 7 mda  and our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of developments and activities that occurred in 2013  including debt financing activities common stock and mandatory convertible preferred stock offerings in october 2013 october equity financings the announcement of a common stock dividend and the transaction with att in december 2013 that provides us exclusive rights to lease operate or otherwise acquire towers that as of december 31 2013 comprise approximately 24 of our towers att acquisition 

as discussed above and in item 7 mda  we commenced operating as a reit for us federal income tax purposes effective january 1 2014 our small cells will initially be included in one or more whollyowned taxable reit subsidiaries trss we have  submitted a private letter ruling request with the internal revenue service irs regarding whether certain components of our small cell business and the related rents qualify as real property under internal revenue code of 1986 as amended code section 856 and thus can be included in our reit  additionally we will include in trss our tower operations in australia and may include certain other assets and operations in trss those trs assets and operations will continue to be subject as applicable to federal and state corporate income taxes and to foreign taxes in the jurisdictions in which such assets and operations are located our foreign assets and operations including our tower operations in puerto rico and australia most likely will be subject to foreign income taxes in the jurisdictions in which such assets and operations are located regardless of whether they are included in a trs or not 

during 2013  consumer demand for wireless data services continued to grow this growth in wireless data services is driven by increased mobile video mobile internet usage and machinetomachine applications we expect that consumers growing wireless voice and data consumption will likely result in wireless carriers focusing on improving network quality and capacity by adding additional antennas or other equipment for the transmission of their services to wireless infrastructure in an effort to improve customer retention or satisfaction all four of the major us wireless carriers are in various stages of deploying 4g longterm evolution lte networks which has translated into additional demand for our wireless infrastructure 

the company 

virtually all of our operations are located in the us and australia we conduct substantially all of our operations through subsidiaries of crown castle operating company ccoc including 1 certain subsidiaries which operate our wireless infrastructure portfolios in the us and 2 a 776 owned subsidiary that operates our australia tower portfolio for more information about our operating segments as well as financial information about the geographic areas in which we operate see note 17  to our consolidated financial statements and item 7 mda

ccusa 

site rental  the core business of ccusa is providing access to our wireless infrastructure we predominately provide access to wireless carriers under longterm contracts for their antennas which transmit a variety of signals related to wireless voice and data we believe our wireless infrastructure is integral to our customers networks and their ability to serve their customers 

we acquired ownership interests or exclusive rights to approximately 90 of our towers in ccusa from the four largest us wireless carriers or their predecessors through transactions consummated since 1999 including transactions with 1 att in 2013 2 tmobile in 2012 3 global signal inc global signal in 2007 which had originally acquired the majority of its towers from sprint 4 companies now part of verizon wireless during 1999 and 2000 and 5 companies now part of att during 1999 and 2000 our small cells were predominately acquired through the acquisitions of nextg networks inc in 2012 and newpath networks inc in 2010 

we generally receive monthly rental payments from tenants payable under longterm contracts we have existing master lease agreements with most us wireless carriers including verizon wireless att sprint and tmobile such agreements provide certain terms including economic terms that govern contracts on our towers entered into by such carriers during the term of their master lease agreements over the last several years we have negotiated up to 15year terms for both initial and renewal periods for certain of our customers which often included fixed escalations we continue to endeavor to negotiate with our existing customer base for longer contractual terms which often may contain fixed escalation rates 

our customer contracts have historically had a high renewal rate with limited exceptions the customer contracts may not be terminated prior to the end of their current term in general each customer contract which is renewable will automatically renew at the end of its term unless the customer provides prior notice of its intent not to renew see note 16  to our consolidated financial statements for a tabular presentation of the minimum rental cash payments due to us by tenants pursuant to contract agreements without consideration of tenant renewal options 

the average monthly rental payment of a new tenant added to wireless infrastructure can vary based on 1 aggregate customer volume 2 the different regions in the us or 3 the physical size weight and shape of the antenna installation and related equipment with respect to our small cells the amount of the monthly payments can also be influenced by similar factors as well as the amount or cost of 1 installation 2 fiber strands 3 equipment at the site or 4 any prepaid rent received we also routinely receive rental payment increases in connection with contract amendments pursuant to which our customers add additional antennas or other equipment to wireless infrastructure on which they already have equipment pursuant to preexisting contract agreements in some cases we have effectively presold via a firm contractual commitment a significant portion of the modification of the existing installations relating to certain lte upgrades in exchange for an increase in the future contracted revenue above that of a typical escalation over a period of time typically a three or four year period see item 7 mda—general overview 

approximately twothirds of our direct site operating expenses consist of lease expenses and the remainder includes property taxes repairs and maintenance employee compensation or related benefit costs or utilities our cash operating expenses tend to escalate at approximately the rate of inflation partially offset by reductions in cash lease expenses from our purchases of land interests as a result of the relatively fixed nature of these expenditures the colocation of additional tenants is achieved at a low incremental operating cost resulting in high incremental operating cash flows our wireless infrastructure portfolio requires minimal sustaining capital expenditures including maintenance or other nondiscretionary capital expenditures and are typically less than 2 of net revenues see note 16  to our consolidated financial statements for a tabular presentation of the rental cash payments owed by us to landlords pursuant to our contractual agreements 

network services  as part of ccusas effort to provide comprehensive solutions it offers certain network services relating to its wireless infrastructure consisting of 1 customer equipment installation and subsequent augmentations collectively installation services and 2 the following additional site development services relating to our customers existing or new antenna installations on ccusas wireless infrastructure site acquisition architectural and engineering zoning or permitting or other construction or network development related services for 2013  56 of ccusas network services and other revenues related to installation services and the remainder related to additional site development services we have grown our network service revenues over the last several years as a result of our focus on customer service increasing our market share for installation services on our wireless infrastructure promoting site development services expanding the scope of our services and engaging in an increased volume resulting from carrier network upgrades we have the capability and expertise to install with the assistance of our network of subcontractors equipment or antenna systems for our customers we do not always provide the installation or site development services for our customers on our wireless infrastructure as third parties also provide these services see also  —competition  below these activities are typically nonrecurring and highly competitive with a number of local competitors in most markets nearly all of our antenna installation services are billed on a costplus profit basis 

 3 

customers  we work extensively with large national wireless carriers and in general our customers are primarily comprised of providers of wireless voice or data services who operate national or regional networks the following table summarizes the net revenues from our four largest customers expressed as a percentage of ccusa net revenue and our consolidated net revenues for 2013  the following table is presented after giving effect to tmobiles acquisition of metropcs completed in april 2013 sprints acquisition of clearwire completed in july 2013 and atts pending acquisition of leap wireless see item 1a risk factors 



sales and marketing  our sales organization markets our wireless infrastructure within the wireless communications industry with the objectives of providing access to existing wireless infrastructure or to new wireless infrastructure prior to construction as well as obtaining network services related to our wireless infrastructure we seek to become the critical partner and preferred independent wireless infrastructure provider for our customers and increase customer satisfaction relative to our peers by leveraging our 1 customer relationships 2 processcentric approach and 3 technological tools 

a team of national account directors maintains our relationships with our largest customers these directors work to develop wireless infrastructure leasing or network service opportunities as well as to ensure that customers wireless infrastructure needs are efficiently translated into new leases on our wireless infrastructure sales personnel in our area offices develop and maintain local relationships with our customers that are expanding their networks entering new markets bringing new technologies to market or requiring maintenance or addon business in addition to our fulltime sales or marketing staff a number of senior managers and officers spend a significant portion of their time on sales and marketing activities and call on existing or prospective customers 

we use public and proprietary databases to develop targeted marketing programs focused on carrier network expansions including small cells or related network services we attempt to match specific wireless infrastructure in our portfolio with potential new site demand by obtaining and analyzing information including our customers existing antenna locations tenant contracts marketing strategies capital spend plans deployment status or actual wireless carrier signal strength measurements taken in the field we have developed a webbased tool that stores key wireless infrastructure information above and beyond normal property management information including data on actual customer signal strength demographics site readiness or competitive structures in addition the webbased tool assists us in estimating potential demand for our wireless infrastructure with greater speed and accuracy we believe these and other tools we have developed assist our customers in their site selection or deployment of their wireless networks and provide us with an opportunity to have proactive discussions with them regarding their wireless infrastructure deployment plans and the timing or location of their demand for our wireless infrastructure a key aspect to our sales and marketing strategy is a continued emphasis on our processcentric approach to reduce cycle time related to new leasing or amendments which helps provide our customers with faster deployment of their networks 

competition  we compete with 1 other independent tower owners which also provide site rental or network services 2 wireless carriers which build own or operate their own tower networks and lease space to other wireless communication companies and 3 owners of alternative infrastructure including rooftops water towers broadcast towers utility poles das or other small cells some of the larger independent tower companies with which we compete in the us include american tower corporation and sba communications corporation in addition some wireless carriers own and operate their own tower networks we believe that tower location deployment speed quality of service capacity and price have been and will continue to be the most significant competitive factors affecting the leasing of wireless infrastructure see item 1a risk factors 

competitors in our network services offering include site acquisition consultants zoning consultants real estate firms rightofway consulting firms construction companies tower owners or managers radio frequency engineering consultants telecommunications equipment vendors who can provide turnkey site development services through multiple subcontractors or our customers internal staff we believe that our customers base their decisions on the outsourcing of network services on criteria such as a companys experience track record local reputation price or time for completion of a project

ccal 

our primary business in australia is providing access to antenna space on towers to our customers we own 776 of ccal ccal is the largest independent tower operator in australia as of december 31 2013  56  of ccals towers were located in seven major metropolitan areas the majority of ccals towers were acquired from optus in 2000 and vodafone in 2001 ccal also provides site development services and property management services for towers owned by third parties 

for 2013  ccal comprised approximately 5  of our consolidated net revenues ccals principal customers are vodafone hutchison australia a joint venture between vodafone and hutchison vha optus and telstra which collectively accounted for approximately 89 of ccals 2013  revenues during 2013  the australian government continued the development and roll out of the national broadband network nbn nbn is a national highspeed openaccess data network targeting nearly all australian premises and includes a fixed wireless broadband network expected to be deployed by 2016 we believe that the continued development of nbn may result in additional future demand for 1 new tenant additions on ccals existing towers or 2 the construction of new towers 

in australia ccal competes with wireless carriers which own and operate their own tower networks service companies that provide site development or property management services and other site owners such as broadcasters and building owners the other significant tower owners in australia are broadcast australia an independent operator of broadcast towers and telstra and optus wireless carriers we believe that tower location quality of service deployment speed capacity or price within a geographic market are the most significant competitive factors affecting the leasing of wireless infrastructure in australia 

employees 

at january 31 2014  we employed approximately 1900 people worldwide including approximately 1700 in the us we are not a party to any collective bargaining agreements we have not experienced any strikes or work stoppages and management believes that our employee relations are satisfactory 

regulatory and environmental matters 

to date we have not incurred any material fines or penalties or experienced any material adverse effects to our business as a result of any domestic or international regulations the summary below is based on regulations currently in effect and such regulations are subject to review or modification by the applicable governmental authority from time to time if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations we may be fined or even lose our rights to conduct some of our business 

united states 

we are required to comply with a variety of federal state and local regulations and laws in the us including federal communications commission fcc and federal aviation administration faa regulations and those discussed under —environmental  below 

federal regulations  both the fcc and the faa regulate towers used for wireless communications radio or television broadcasting such regulations control the siting lighting or marking of towers and may depending on the characteristics of particular towers require the registration of tower facilities with the fcc and the issuance of determinations confirming no hazard to air traffic wireless communications devices operating on towers are separately regulated and independently licensed based upon the particular frequency used in addition the fcc and the faa have developed standards to consider proposals for new or modified tower or antenna structures based upon the height or location including proximity to airports proposals to construct or to modify existing tower or antenna structures above certain heights are reviewed by the faa to ensure the structure will not present a hazard to aviation which determination may be conditioned upon compliance with lighting or marking requirements the fcc requires its licensees to operate communications devices only on towers that comply with faa rules and are registered with the fcc if required by its regulations where tower lighting is required by faa regulation tower owners bear the responsibility of notifying the faa of any tower lighting outage and ensuring the timely restoration of such outages failure to comply with the applicable requirements may lead to civil penalties 

local regulations  the us telecommunications act of 1996 amended the communications act of 1934 to preserve state and local zoning authorities jurisdiction over the siting of communications towers and small cells the law however limits local zoning authority by prohibiting actions by local authorities that discriminate between different service providers of wireless services or ban altogether the provision of wireless services additionally the law prohibits state and local restrictions based on the environmental effects of radio frequency emissions to the extent the facilities comply with fcc regulations 

 5 

local regulations include city and other local ordinances including subdivision and zoning ordinances approvals for construction modification and removal of towers and small cells and restrictive covenants imposed by community developers these regulations vary greatly but typically require us to obtain approval from local officials prior to tower construction local zoning authorities may render decisions that prevent the construction or modification of towers or place conditions on such construction or modifications that are responsive to community residents concerns regarding the height visibility or other characteristics of the towers to expedite the deployment of wireless networks the fcc issued a declaratory ruling in 2009 which is currently under appeal establishing timeframes for the review of applications by local and state governments of 90 days for colocations and 150 days for new tower construction the middle class tax relief and job creation act of 2012 mandates that state and local governments must approve an eligible facilitys request for the modification of an existing tower that does not substantially change the dimensions of such tower notwithstanding the fcc declaratory ruling and recent legislation decisions of local zoning authorities may also adversely affect the timing or cost of wireless infrastructure construction or modification 

some of our small cell related subsidiaries hold authorization to provide intrastate telecommunication services as competitive local exchange carriers clec in numerous states and to provide domestic interstate telecommunication services as authorized by the fcc these small cell subsidiaries are primarily regulated by state public service commissions which have jurisdiction over public rightsofway clec status in certain cases helps promote access to such public rightsofway which is beneficial to the deployment of our small cell on a timely basis status as a clec often allows us to deploy our small cell systems in locations where zoning restrictions might otherwise delay restrict or prevent building or expanding traditional wireless tower sites or traditional wireless rooftop sites 

environmental we are required to comply with a variety of federal state and local environmental laws and regulations protecting environmental quality including air and water quality and wildlife protection to date we have not incurred any material fines or penalties or experienced any material adverse effects to our business as a result of any domestic or international environmental regulations or matters see item 1a risk factors 

the construction of new towers or in some cases the modification of existing towers in the us may be subject to environmental review under the national environmental policy act of 1969 as amended nepa which requires federal agencies to evaluate the environmental impact of major federal actions the fcc has promulgated regulations implementing nepa which require applicants to investigate the potential environmental impact of the proposed tower construction should the proposed tower construction present a significant environmental impact the fcc must prepare an environmental impact statement subject to public comment if the proposed construction or modification of a tower may have a significant impact on the environment the fccs approval of the construction or modification could be significantly delayed 

our operations are subject to federal state and local laws and regulations relating to the management use storage disposal emission or remediation ofor exposure to hazardous or nonhazardous substances materials or wastes as an owner lessee or operator of real property we are subject to certain environmental laws that impose strict jointandseveral liability for the cleanup of onsite or offsite contamination relating to existing or historical operations or we could also be subject to personal injury or property damage claims relating to such contamination in general our customer contracts prohibit our customers from using or storing any hazardous substances on our tower sites in violation of applicable environmental laws and require our customers to provide notice of certain environmental conditions caused by them 

as licensees and wireless infrastructure owners we are also subject to regulations and guidelines that impose a variety of operational requirements relating to radio frequency emissions as employers we are subject to occupational safety and health administration and similar occupational health and safety legislation in australia and similar guidelines regarding employee protection from radio frequency exposure the potential connection between radio frequency emissions and certain negative health effects including some forms of cancer has been the subject of substantial study by the scientific community in recent years 

we have compliance programs and monitoring projects to help assure that we are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws nevertheless there can be no assurance that the costs of compliance with existing or future environmental laws will not have a material adverse effect on us 

other regulations  we hold through certain of our subsidiaries licenses for common carrier microwave service which are subject to additional regulation by the fcc our fcc license relating to our 16701675 mhz us nationwide spectrum license spectrum is pending fcc renewal and contains certain conditions related to the services that may be provided thereunder the technical equipment used in connection therewith and the circumstances under which it may be renewed we have leased the spectrum to a third party through 2023 subject to the lessees option to purchase the spectrum 

 6 

australia 

federal regulations  carrier licenses and nominated carrier declarations issued under the australian telecommunications act 1997 authorize the use of network units for the supply of telecommunications services to the public the definition of network units includes line links and base stations used for wireless voice services but does not include tower infrastructure accordingly ccal as a tower owner and operator does not require a carrier license under the australian telecommunications act 1997 similarly because ccal does not own any transmitters or spectrum it does not currently require any apparatus or spectrum licenses issued under the australian radiocommunications act 1992 

carriers have a statutory obligation to provide other carriers with access to towers and if there is a dispute including a pricing dispute the matter may be referred to the australian competition and consumer commission for resolution as a noncarrier ccal is not subject to this requirement and our customers negotiate site access on a commercial basis 

while the australian telecommunications act 1997 grants certain exemptions from planning laws for the installation of low impact facilities newly constructed towers are expressly excluded from the definition of low impact facilities accordingly in connection with the construction of towers ccal is subject to state and local planning laws that vary on a sitebysite basis typically requiring us to obtain approval from local government agencies prior to tower construction subject to certain exceptions structural enhancements may be undertaken on behalf of a carrier without state or local planning approval under the general maintenance power under the australian telecommunications act 1997 although these enhancements may be subject to state and local planning laws if ccal is unable to obtain carrier cooperation to use such power for a limited number of towers ccal is also required to install aircraft warning lighting in compliance with federal aviation regulations in australia a carrier may arguably be able to utilize the maintenance power under the australian telecommunications act 1997 to remain as a tenant on a tower after the expiration of a site license or sublease however ccals customer access agreements generally limit the ability of customers to do this and even if a carrier did utilize this power the carrier would be required to pay for ccals financial loss which would roughly equal the site rental revenues that would have otherwise been payable 

local regulations  in australia there are various local state and territory laws and regulations which relate to among other things town planning and zoning restrictions standards or approvals for the design construction or alteration of a structure or facility or environmental regulations as in the us these laws vary greatly but typically require tower owners to obtain approval from governmental bodies prior to tower construction and to comply with environmental laws on an ongoing basis 




 item 1a risk factors 

you should carefully consider all of the risks described below as well as the other information contained in this document when evaluating your investment in our securities 

our business depends on the demand for wireless communications and wireless infrastructure and we may be adversely affected by any slowdown in such demand additionally a reduction in carrier network investment may materially and adversely affect our business including reducing demand for new tenant additions or network services 

demand for our wireless infrastructure depends on the demand for antenna space from our customers which in turn depends on the demand for wireless voice and data services by their customers the willingness of our customers to utilize our wireless infrastructure or renew or extend existing contracts on our wireless infrastructure is affected by numerous factors including 

  7 

a slowdown in demand for wireless communications or our wireless infrastructure may negatively impact our growth or otherwise have a material adverse effect on us if our customers or potential customers are unable to raise adequate capital to fund their business plans as a result of disruptions in the financial and credit markets or otherwise they may reduce their spending which could adversely affect our anticipated growth or the demand for our wireless infrastructure or network services 

historically the amount of our customers network investment is cyclical and has varied based upon the various matters described in these risk factors changes in carrier network investment typically impact the demand for our wireless infrastructure as a result changes in carrier plans such as delays in the implementation of new systems new technologies including with respect to the use of small cells or plans to expand coverage or capacity may reduce demand for our wireless infrastructure furthermore the wireless communication industry could experience a slowdown or slowing growth rates as a result of numerous factors including a reduction in consumer demand for wireless services or general economic conditions there can be no assurances that weakness or uncertainty in the economic environment will not adversely impact the wireless communications industry which may materially and adversely affect our business including by reducing demand for our wireless infrastructure or network services in addition a slowdown may increase competition for site rental customers or network services a wireless communications industry slowdown or a reduction in carrier network investment may materially and adversely affect our business 

a substantial portion of our revenues is derived from a small number of customers and the loss consolidation or financial instability of any of our limited number of customers may materially decrease revenues or reduce demand for our wireless infrastructure and network services 

for 2013  approximately 88  of our consolidated revenues were derived from sprint tmobile att and verizon wireless which represented 27  23  22  and 16  respectively of our consolidated net revenues respectively after giving effect to tmobiles acquisition of metropcs completed in april 2013 sprints acquisition of clearwire completed in july 2013 and atts pending acquisition of leap wireless the loss of any one of our large customers as a result of consolidation merger bankruptcy insolvency network sharing roaming joint development resale agreements by our customers or otherwise may result in 1 a material decrease in our revenues 2 uncollectible account receivables 3 an impairment of our deferred site rental receivables wireless infrastructure assets site rental contracts and customer relationships intangible assets or 4 other adverse effects to our business we cannot guarantee that contracts with our major customers will not be terminated or that these customers will renew their contracts with us in addition to our four largest customers in the us we also derive a portion of our revenues and anticipated future growth from customers offering or contemplating offering emerging wireless services such customers are smaller or have less financial resources than our four largest customers have business models which may not be successful or may require additional capital see also item 1 business—the company 

such consolidation among our customers will likely result in duplicate or overlapping parts of networks for example where they are coresidents on a tower which may result in the termination or nonrenewal of customer contracts and impact revenues from our wireless infrastructure we expect that any termination of customer contracts as a result of this potential consolidation would be spread over multiple years as existing contracts expire in addition consolidation may result in a reduction in such customers future capital expenditures in the aggregate because their expansion plans may be similar wireless carrier consolidation could decrease the demand for our wireless infrastructure which in turn may result in a reduction in our revenues or cash flows see note 17  to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of recently completed or pending customer consolidations see item 7 mda—general overview  for further discussion of our customers network enhancement deployments and any related nonrenewal of customer contracts 

our substantial level of indebtedness could adversely affect our ability to react to changes in our business and the terms of our debt instruments limit our ability to take a number of actions that our management might otherwise believe to be in our best interests in addition if we fail to comply with our covenants our debt could be accelerated 

as a result of our substantial indebtedness 

  8 

 currently we have debt instruments in place that limit in certain circumstances our ability to incur indebtedness pay dividends create liens sell assets or engage in certain mergers and acquisitions among other things certain of our subsidiaries under their debt instruments are also required to maintain specific financial ratios our ability to comply with the financial ratio covenants under these instruments or to satisfy our debt obligations will depend on our future operating performance if we fail to comply with the debt restrictions we will be in default under those instruments which in some cases would cause the maturity of a substantial portion of our longterm indebtedness to be accelerated furthermore if the limits on our ability to pay dividends prevent us from satisfying our reit distribution requirements we could fail to qualify for taxation as a reit if these limits do not jeopardize our qualification for taxation as a reit but nevertheless prevent us from distributing 100 of our reit taxable income we will be subject to federal corporate income tax and potentially a nondeductible excise tax on the retained amounts if our operating subsidiaries were to default on the debt the trustee could seek to foreclose the collateral securing such debt in which case we could lose the wireless infrastructure and the revenues associated with the wireless infrastructure we are currently in compliance with our debt service coverage and leverage ratios see item 7 mda—liquidity and capital resources—debt covenants  for a further discussion of our debt covenants 

ccic and ccoc are holding companies that conduct all of their operations through their subsidiaries accordingly ccics and ccocs respective sources of cash to pay interest or principal on their outstanding indebtedness are distributions relating to their respective ownership interests in their subsidiaries from the net earnings and cash flows generated by such subsidiaries or from proceeds of debt or equity offerings earnings and cash flows generated by their subsidiaries are first applied by such subsidiaries to conduct their operations including servicing their respective debt obligations after which any excess cash flows generally may be paid to such holding company in the absence of any special conditions such as a continuing event of default however their subsidiaries are legally distinct from the holding companies and unless they guarantee such debt have no obligation to pay amounts due on their debt or to make funds available to us for such payment 

we have a substantial amount of indebtedness in the event we do not repay or refinance such indebtedness we could face substantial liquidity issues and might be required to issue equity securities or securities convertible into equity securities or sell some of our assets to meet our debt payment obligations 

we have a substantial amount of indebtedness approximately 116 billion  as of december 31 2013  which we will need to refinance or repay see item 7 mda—liquidity and capital resources  for a tabular presentation of our contractual debt maturities there can be no assurances we will be able to refinance our indebtedness 1 on commercially reasonable terms 2 on terms including with respect to interest rates as favorable as our current debt or 3 at all 

economic conditions and the credit markets have historically experienced and may continue to experience periods of volatility uncertainty or weakness any renewed financial turmoil worsening credit environment weakening of the general economy or further uncertainty could impact the availability or cost of debt financing including with respect to any refinancing of the obligations described above or on our ability to draw the full amount of our 15 billion revolving credit facility that as of february 14 2014  has 11 billion  of undrawn availability 

if we are unable to refinance or renegotiate our debt we cannot guarantee that we will be able to generate enough cash flows from operations or that we will be able to obtain enough capital to service our debt or fund our planned capital expenditures in such an event we could face substantial liquidity issues and might be required to issue equity securities or securities convertible into equity securities or sell some of our assets to meet our debt payment obligations failure to refinance indebtedness when required could result in a default under such indebtedness assuming we meet certain financial ratios we have the ability under our debt instruments to incur additional indebtedness and any additional indebtedness we incur could exacerbate the risks described above 

sales or issuances of a substantial number of shares of our common stock may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

future sales or issuances of a substantial number of shares of our common stock or other equity related securities may adversely affect the market price of our common stock as of february 14 2014  we had 3341 million  shares of common stock outstanding in addition we reserved 125 million and 132 million respectively of shares of common stock for issuance under our various stock compensation plans and our 450 mandatory convertible preferred stock the dividends on our 450 mandatory preferred stock may also be paid in cash or subject to certain limitations shares of common stock or any combination of cash and shares of common stock

in addition a small number of stockholders own a significant percentage of our outstanding common stock if any one of these stockholders or any group of our stockholders sells a large quantity of shares of our common stock or the public market perceives that existing stockholders might sell a large quantity of shares of our common stock the market price of our common stock may significantly decline 

as a result of competition in our industry including from some competitors with significantly more resources or less debt than we have we may find it more difficult to achieve favorable rental rates on our new or renewing customer contracts 

our growth is dependent on entering into new customer contracts as well as renewing or renegotiating customer contracts when existing customer contracts terminate we face competition for site rental customers from various sources including 

 certain wireless carriers own and operate their own towers and small cells and certain of such carriers are larger or have greater financial resources than we have our small cell operations may have different competitors than our traditional site rental business including other owners of small cells or fiber some of which have larger networks or greater financial resources than we have competition in our industry may make it more difficult for us to attract new customers maintain or increase our gross margins or maintain or increase our market share 

the business model for our small cell operations contains certain differences from our traditional site rental business resulting in different operational risks if we do not successfully operate that business model or identify or manage those operational risks such operations may produce results that are less than anticipated 

the business model for our small cell operations contains certain differences from our traditional tower operations including differences relating to customer contract terms landlord demographics ownership of certain network assets operational oversight requirements including requirements for service level agreements regarding network performance and maintenance applicable laws and initial gross margins although longterm gross margins are expected to be similar while our small cell operations have certain risks that are similar to our tower operations they also have certain operational risks that are different from our traditional site rental business including the 1 use of clec status 2 use of public rightsofway 3 use of poles owned solely by or jointly with third parties or 4 risks relating to overbuilding in addition the rate at which wireless carriers adopt small cells may be lower or slower than we anticipate our small cell operations will also expose us to different safety or liability risks or hazards than our traditional site rental business as a result of numerous factors including the location or nature of the assets involved because small cells are comparatively new technologies and are continuing to evolve there may be other risks related to small cells of which we are not yet aware 

new technologies may significantly reduce demand for our wireless infrastructure or negatively impact our revenues 

improvements in the efficiency of wireless networks could reduce the demand for our wireless infrastructure for example signal combining technologies that permit one antenna to service multiple frequencies and thereby multiple customers may reduce the need for our wireless infrastructure in addition other technologies such as wifi femtocells other small cells or satellite such as low earth orbiting and mesh transmission systems may in the future serve as substitutes for or alternatives to leasing that might otherwise be anticipated or expected on wireless infrastructure had such technologies not existed any significant reduction in wireless infrastructure leasing demand resulting from the previously mentioned technologies or other technologies may negatively impact our revenues or otherwise have a material adverse effect on us 

new wireless technologies may not deploy or be adopted by customers as rapidly or in the manner projected 

there can be no assurances that new wireless services or technologies will be introduced or deployed as rapidly or in the manner projected by the wireless or broadcast industries in addition demand or customer adoption rates for such new technologies may be lower or slower than anticipated for numerous reasons as a result growth opportunities or demand for our wireless infrastructure as a result of such technologies may not be realized at the times or to the extent anticipated 

 10 

if we fail to retain rights to our wireless infrastructure including the land interests under our towers our business may be adversely affected 

our property interests relating to the land interests on which our towers reside consist of leasehold and subleasehold interests fee interests easements licenses and rightsofway a loss of these interests may interfere with our ability to conduct our business or generate revenues for various reasons we may not always have the ability to access analyze or verify all information regarding titles or other issues prior to purchasing wireless infrastructure further we may not be able to renew ground leases on commercially viable terms our ability to retain rights to the land interests on which our towers reside depends on our ability to purchase such land including fee interests and perpetual easements or renegotiate or extend the terms of the leases relating to such land approximately 9  of our site rental gross margins for the year ended december 31 2013  are derived from towers where the leases for the land interests under such towers have final expiration dates of less than ten years if we are unable to retain rights to the land interests on which our towers reside our business may be adversely affected 

approximately 53 of our towers are leased or subleased or operated and managed under master leases subleases or other agreements with sprint tmobile and att we have the option to purchase these towers at the end of their respective lease terms such options are not firm commitments and are not required we may not have the required available capital to exercise our right to purchase some or all of these towers at the time these options are exercisable even if we do have available capital we may choose not to exercise our right to purchase these towers or some or all of the tmobile or att towers for business or other reasons in the event that we do not exercise these purchase rights or are otherwise unable to acquire an interest that would allow us to continue to operate these towers after the applicable period we will lose the cash flows derived from such towers which may have a material adverse effect on our business in the event that we decide to exercise these purchase rights the benefits of the acquisition of these towers may not exceed the costs which could adversely affect our business additional information concerning these towers and the applicable purchase options is as follows 

 under master lease or master prepaid lease arrangements we have with tmobile sprint and att certain of our subsidiaries lease or sublease or are otherwise granted the right to manage and operate towers from bankruptcy remote subsidiaries of such carriers if one of these bankruptcy remote subsidiaries nevertheless becomes a debtor in a bankruptcy proceeding and is permitted to reject the underlying ground lease our subsidiaries could lose their interest in the applicable sites if our subsidiaries were to lose their interest in the applicable sites or if the applicable ground leases were to be terminated we would lose the cash flow derived from the towers on those sites which may have a material adverse effect on our business we have similar bankruptcy risks with respect to sites that we operate under management agreements 

our network services business has historically experienced significant volatility in demand which reduces the predictability of our results 

the operating results of our network services business for any particular period may vary significantly and should not necessarily be considered indicative of longerterm results for this activity our network services business may be adversely impacted by various factors including competition economic weakness or uncertainty our market share or changes in the type or volume of work performed 

 11 

the expansion or development of our business including through acquisitions increased product offerings or other strategic growth opportunities may cause disruptions in our business which may have an adverse effect on our business operations or financial results 

we seek to expand and develop our business including through acquisitions a recent example of which is the att acquisition increased product offerings or other strategic growth opportunities in the ordinary course of our business we review analyze and evaluate various potential transactions or other activities in which we may engage such transactions or activities could cause disruptions in increase risk or otherwise negatively impact our business among other things such transaction and activities may 

 for example the integration of the towers from the att acquisition is a significant undertaking and requires significant resources as well as attention from our management team in addition the integration of these towers into our operations requires certain onetime costs for tasks such as tower visits and audits and ground and tenant lease verification if we fail to successfully or efficiently integrate the towers from the att acquisition we may not realize the benefits we expect from the att acquisition and our business financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected 

if we fail to comply with laws or regulations which regulate our business and which may change at any time we may be fined or even lose our right to conduct some of our business 

a variety of federal state local and foreign laws and regulations apply to our business including those discussed in item 1 business   failure to comply with applicable requirements may lead to civil penalties or require us to assume indemnification obligations or breach contractual provisions we cannot guarantee that existing or future laws or regulations including state and local tax laws will not adversely affect our business increase delays or result in additional costs these factors may have a material adverse effect on us 

if radio frequency emissions from wireless handsets or equipment on our wireless infrastructure are demonstrated to cause negative health effects potential future claims could adversely affect our operations costs or revenues 

the potential connection between radio frequency emissions and certain negative health effects including some forms of cancer has been the subject of substantial study by the scientific community in recent years we cannot guarantee that claims relating to radio frequency emissions will not arise in the future or that the results of such studies will not be adverse to us 

public perception of possible health risks associated with cellular or other wireless communications may slow or diminish the growth of wireless companies which may in turn slow or diminish our growth in particular negative public perception of and regulations regarding these perceived health risks may slow or diminish the market acceptance of wireless communications services if a connection between radio frequency emissions and possible negative health effects were established our operations costs or revenues may be materially and adversely affected we currently do not maintain any significant insurance with respect to these matters 

certain provisions of our certification of incorporation charter bylaws and operative agreements and domestic and international competition laws may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us or for us to acquire control of a third party even if such a change in control would be beneficial to our stockholders 

we have a number of antitakeover devices in place that will hinder takeover attempts or may reduce the market value of our common stock our antitakeover provisions include 

  12 

our bylaws permit special meetings of the stockholders to be called only upon the request of our chief executive officer or a majority of the board of directors and deny stockholders the ability to call such meetings such provisions as well as the provisions of section 203 of the delaware general corporation law may impede a merger consolidation takeover or other business combination or discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us 

in addition domestic or international competition laws may prevent or discourage us from acquiring wireless infrastructure in certain geographical areas or impede a merger consolidation takeover or other business combination or discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us 

we may be adversely effected by exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates relating to our operations in australia 

our australian operations expose us to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates for 2013  approximately 5  of our consolidated net revenues were denominated in australian dollars over the past five years the australian dollar has strengthened by 27  against the us dollar we have not historically engaged in significant hedging activities relating to our australian operations and we may suffer future losses as a result of changes in currency exchange rates 

future dividend payments to our common stockholders will reduce the availability of our cash on hand available to fund future discretionary investments and may result in a need to incur indebtedness or issue equity securities to fund growth opportunities in such event the then current economic credit market or equity market conditions may impact the availability or cost of such financing which could hinder our ability to grow our per share results of operations 

in february 2014 our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of 035 per share to our common stockholders which is expected to result in an annual aggregate payment of 470 million see note 20  to our consolidated financial statements effective january 1 2014 we commenced operating as a reit for us federal income tax purposes to qualify and be taxed as a reit we will generally be required to distribute at least 90 of our reit taxable income after the utilization of any available net operating loss carryforward determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding net capital gain each year to our stockholders as a result we anticipate making distributions to our common stockholders in the form of dividends in the future 

we have historically invested our cash from operations in discretionary investments such as in no particular order purchasing our common stock acquiring or constructing wireless infrastructure acquiring land interests under towers improving or structurally enhancing our existing wireless infrastructure or purchasing repaying or redeeming our debt alternative means of accessing cash to fund future discretionary investments similar to those we have historically made including through the credit or equity markets either 1 may not be available to us or 2 may not be accessible by us at terms that would result in the investment of the net proceeds raised yielding incremental growth in our per share operating results as a result future dividend payments may hinder our ability to grow our per share results of operations or otherwise adversely affect our ability to execute our business plan 

qualifying and remaining qualified to be taxed as a reit involves highly technical and complex provisions of the us internal revenue code failure to remain qualified as a reit would result in our inability to deduct dividends to stockholders when computing our taxable income which would reduce our available cash 

on january 1 2014 we began operating as a reit for federal tax purposes as a reit we will generally be entitled to a deduction for dividends that we pay and therefore will not be subject to us federal corporate income tax on our net taxable income that is currently distributed to our stockholders 

we have received opinions from special reit tax counsel special tax counsel to the effect that we are organized in conformity with the requirements for qualification and taxation as a reit under the code and that our method of operation enables us to meet the requirements for qualification and taxation as a reit commencing with our taxable year ending december 31 2014  while we intend to operate so that we qualify as a reit given the highly complex nature of the rules governing reits the ongoing importance of factual determinations and the possibility of future changes in our circumstances no assurance can be given by special tax counsel or by us that we will qualify as a reit for any particular year as such we cannot guarantee that we will qualify or remain so qualified 

if in any taxable year we fail to qualify for taxation as a reit and are not entitled to relief under the code then 

  13 

tax purposes we would be disqualified from reelecting reit status for the four taxable years following the year during which we were so disqualified 

although we may have federal net operating losses available to reduce any taxable income to the extent our federal net operating losses have been utilized or are otherwise unavailable any such corporate tax liability could be substantial would reduce the amount of cash available for other purposes and might necessitate the borrowing of additional funds or the liquidation of some investments to pay any additional tax liability accordingly funds available for investment would be reduced 

under the code no more than 25 of the value of the assets of a reit may be represented by securities of one or more trss or other nonqualifying assets this limitation may affect our ability to make additional investments in nonreit qualifying operations or assets or in any operations held through trss the net income of our trss is not required to be distributed to us and income that is not distributed to us generally will not be subject to the reit income distribution requirement however there may be limitations on our ability to accumulate earnings in our trss and the accumulation or reinvestment of significant earnings in our trss could result in adverse tax treatment in particular if the accumulation of cash in our trss causes the fair market value of our securities in our trss or certain other nonqualifying assets to exceed 25 of the fair market value of our assets at the end of any quarter then we may fail to qualify as a reit 

complying with reit requirements including the 90 distribution requirement may limit our flexibility or cause us to forgo otherwise attractive opportunities including certain discretionary investments and potential financing alternatives 

to qualify and be taxed as a reit we will generally be required to distribute at least 90 of our reit taxable income after the utilization of any available net operating loss carryforward determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding net capital gain each year to our stockholders our determination as to the timing or amount of future dividends will be based on a number of factors including investment opportunities around our core business and the availability of our existing federal net operating losses of approximately 22 billion to reduce our reit taxable income in february 2014 our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of 035 per share to our common stockholders   see note 20  to our consolidated financial statements any such dividends however are subject to the determination of our board of directors based on thencurrent and anticipated future conditions including our earnings net cash provided by operating activities capital requirements financial condition our relative market capitalization our existing federal net operating losses or other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors 

to the extent that we satisfy the 90 distribution requirement but distribute less than 100 of our reit taxable income after the application of available net operating losses if any we will be subject to federal corporate income tax on our undistributed taxable income in addition we will be subject to a 4 nondeductible excise tax if the actual amount that we pay out to our stockholders for a calendar year is less than a minimum amount specified under the code 

from time to time we may generate reit taxable income greater than our cash flow as a result of differences in timing between the recognition of taxable income and the actual receipt of cash or the effect of nondeductible capital expenditures the creation of reserves or required debt or amortization payments if we do not have other funds available in these situations we could be required to borrow funds on unfavorable terms sell assets at disadvantageous prices or distribute amounts that would otherwise be invested in future acquisitions to make distributions sufficient to enable us to pay out enough of our taxable income to satisfy the reit dividend requirement and to avoid corporate income tax and the 4 excise tax in a particular year these alternatives could increase our costs or reduce our equity thus compliance with the reit requirements may hinder our ability to grow which could adversely affect the value of our common stock furthermore the reit dividend requirements may increase the financing we need to fund capital expenditures future growth or expansion initiatives which would increase our total leverage 

in addition to satisfying the distribution test to remain qualified as a reit for tax purposes we will need to continually satisfy tests concerning among other things the sources of our income the nature and diversification of our assets and the ownership of our capital stock compliance with these tests will require us to refrain from certain activities and may hinder our ability to make certain attractive investments including the purchase of nonqualifying assets the expansion of nonreal estate activities or investments in the businesses to be conducted by our trss and to that extent limit our opportunities and our flexibility to change our business strategy furthermore acquisition opportunities in domestic or international markets may be adversely affected if we need or require the target company to comply with some reit requirements prior to completing any such acquisition in addition our conversion to a reit may result in investor pressures not to pursue growth opportunities that are not immediately accretive 

moreover if we fail to comply with certain asset ownership tests at the end of any calendar quarter we must correct the failure within 30 days after the end of the calendar quarter or qualify for certain statutory relief provisions to avoid losing our reit qualification as a result we may be required to liquidate assets in adverse market conditions or forgo otherwise attractive investments these actions may reduce our income and amounts available for distribution to our stockholders 

 14 

if we fail to pay scheduled dividends on the 450 mandatory convertible preferred stock in cash common stock or any combination of cash and common stock we will be prohibited from paying dividends on our common stock which may jeopardize our status as a reit 

the terms of the 450 mandatory convertible preferred stock provide that unless accumulated dividends have been paid or set aside for payment on all outstanding 450 mandatory convertible preferred stock for all past dividend periods no dividends may be declared or paid on our common stock if that were to occur the inability to pay dividends on our common stock might jeopardize our status as a reit for us federal income tax purposes see note 12  to our condensed consolidated financial statements 

we have limited experience operating as a reit our failure to successfully operate as a reit may adversely affect our financial condition cash flow the per share trading price of our common stock or our ability to satisfy debt service obligations 

we have limited operating history as a reit in addition our senior management team has limited experience operating a reit we cannot assure you that our past experience will be sufficient to operate our company successfully as a reit including our ability to remain qualified as a reit failure to maintain reit status could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations cash flow or ability to satisfy debt service obligations 

we expect to pursue certain reitrelated ownership limitations and transfer restrictions with respect to our capital stock 

in order for us to qualify as a reit under the code shares of our capital stock must be owned by 100 or more persons during at least 335 days of a taxable year of 12 months or during a proportionate part of a shorter taxable year other than the first year for which an election to be taxed as a reit has been made also not more than 50 of the value of the outstanding shares of our capital stock may be owned directly or indirectly by five or fewer individuals as defined in the code to include certain entities such as private foundations during the last half of a taxable year other than the first year for which an election to be taxed as a reit has been made to qualify as a reit we must satisfy other requirements as well 

our charter does not currently contain reitrelated limitations on the ownership or restrictions on the transfer of our capital stock during 2014 we intend to pursue the adoption which may be effected by merger or otherwise of customary reitrelated ownership limitations and transfer restrictions in our charter or the certificate of incorporation or other equivalent governing document of a successor entity in order to protect our ability to remain qualified as a reit the actual provisions that we ultimately propose will depend on a number of considerations and those proposed provisions will be subject to approval by our board of directors and ultimately a vote of our common stockholders in general we expect that the proposed provisions will provide that among other things and subject to certain exceptions no person may own or be deemed to own by virtue of the attribution provisions of the code more than 98 by value or number of shares whichever is more restrictive of the outstanding shares of our common stock or 98 in aggregate value of all classes and series of our capital stock in addition we expect our charter will provide that no person may beneficially own shares of our capital stock to the extent such ownership would cause us to fail to qualify as a domestically controlled qualified investment entity we expect that the proposed provisions will provide that in the event any transfer of shares of stock or other event would result in a person intended transferee beneficially or constructively owning shares in excess of an ownership limit or that would otherwise result in our disqualification as a reit or cause us to fail to qualify as a domestically controlled qualified investment entity the number of shares that would cause a violation of the applicable limit referred to as the excess shares will be automatically transferred to a trust for the benefit of a charitable organization selected by our board of directors if a transfer to a trust would not avoid a violation of the ownership limitation provisions for some reason we expect our proposed provisions to provide that such transfer of the excess shares to the intended transferee will be null and void and of no force or effect 

we expect our ownership limitations and transfer restrictions will provide that within a certain number of days after receiving notice of the transfer of excess shares to the charitable trust the trustee of the trust will be required to sell the excess shares to a person who could own such shares without violating the applicable ownership limitation provision the trustee upon a sale of these excess shares would distribute to the intended transferee an amount equal to the lesser of the price paid by the intended transferee for the excess shares or the net sales proceeds received by the trust for the excess shares if the excess shares were a gift or were not a transfer for value we anticipate that the provisions will provide that the trustee will distribute to the intended transferee an amount equal to the lesser of the fair market value of the excess shares as of the date of the automatic transfer to the trust or the sales proceeds received by the trust for the excess shares proceeds in excess of the amount distributable to the intended transferee would be distributed to the charitable beneficiary 

in addition we expect that excess shares held in the trust would be deemed to have been offered for sale to us or our designee at a price per share equal to the lesser of 1 the price per share in the transaction that resulted in such transfer to the trust or in the case of a gift or other transaction not for value the market price at the time of the gift or other transaction and 2 the market price on the date we or our designee accept the offer in such case we would have the right to accept such offer until the trustee has sold the shares in the trust 

 15 

to the extent we propose and our common stockholders approve the adoption of these types of customary reitrelated ownership limitations and transfer restrictions such ownership limitations and transfer restrictions would be applicable to all classes and series of our capital stock and such provisions could have the effect of delaying deferring or preventing a takeover or other transaction in which stockholders might receive a premium for their shares over the then prevailing market price or which stockholders might believe to be otherwise in their best interest 

we expect any such ownership limitations or transfer restrictions will provide that our board of directors may in its sole discretion increase the 98 ownership limitation referred to above with respect to one or more stockholders subject to such terms conditions representations or undertakings as our board of directors deems appropriate

wireless infrastructure 

towers are vertical metal structures generally ranging in height from 50 to 500 feet in addition wireless communications equipment may also be placed on building rooftops and other structures our towers are located on tracts of land with an average size of approximately 20000 square feet these tracts of land support the towers equipment shelters and where applicable guyed wires to stabilize the structure our small cells are typically located in areas in which zoning restrictions or other barriers may prevent or delay the deployment of a tower and often are attached to public rightofway infrastructure including utility poles or street lights or are located at venues or universities to date our small cells are das which is a network of antennas for the benefit of wireless carriers and is connected by fiber to communication hubs designed to facilitate wireless communications 

see item 1 business—overview  for information regarding our wireless infrastructure portfolio including with respect to our land interests and for a discussion of the location of our towers in the us and australia including the percentage of our us towers in the top 50 and 100 btas see item 7 mda—liquidity and capital resources—contractual cash obligations  for a tabular presentation of the remaining terms to final expiration of the leases for the land interests which we do not own and on which our towers are located as of december 31 2013

overview 

we own operate and lease shared wireless infrastructure see item 1 business  for a further discussion of our business including our longterm strategy certain key terms of our lease agreements and growth trends in the wireless communications industry site rental revenues represented 83  of our 2013  consolidated net revenues ccusa our largest operating segment accounted for 95  of our 2013  site rental revenues 

the following are certain highlights of our business fundamentals and results   as of and for the year ended december 31 2013  

  22 

 the following are certain highlights of our 2014 outlook that impact our business fundamentals described above 

 att acquisition and financing 

in october 2013 we entered into a definitive agreement with att to acquire for approximately 4827 billion in cash exclusive rights to att towers which as of december 31 2013 comprise approximately 24 of our towers pursuant to a prepaid lease agreement entered into in connection with the att acquisition we have the exclusive right to lease or sublease or operate and manage for a weightedaverage term of approximately 28 years towers which as of december 31 2013 comprise 22 of our towers in addition pursuant to the att transaction we purchased towers from att which as of december 31 2013 comprise approximately 2 of our towers on december 16 2013 we closed on the att acquisition see notes 1  and 3  to our consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of the terms of the att acquisition including our option to purchase the leased sites at the end of the respective lease terms

see note 17  to our consolidated financial statements for segment results and a reconciliation of net income loss to adjusted ebitda defined below 

our measurement of profit or loss currently used to evaluate our operating performance and operating segments is earnings before interest taxes depreciation amortization and accretion as adjusted adjusted ebitda our measure of adjusted ebitda may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies including companies in the tower sector or other similar providers of wireless infrastructure and is not a measure of performance calculated in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 

we define adjusted ebitda as net income loss plus restructuring charges credits asset writedown charges acquisition and integration costs depreciation amortization and accretion amortization of prepaid lease purchase price adjustments interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs gains losses on retirement of longterm obligations net gain loss on interest rate swaps impairment of availableforsale securities interest income other income expense benefit provision for income taxes cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle income loss from discontinued operations and stockbased compensation expense see note 13  to our consolidated financial statements the reconciliation of adjusted ebitda to our net income loss is set forth in note 17  to our consolidated financial statements adjusted ebitda is not intended as an alternative measure of operating results or cash flows from operations as determined in accordance with gaap and adjusted ebitda may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies adjusted ebitda is discussed further under item 7 mda — accounting and reporting matters—nongaap financial measures

this increase in site rental revenues was impacted by the following items inclusive of straightline accounting in no particular order new tenant additions across our entire portfolio renewals or extensions of customer contracts escalations acquisitions and cancellations of customer contracts the 2012 acquisitions and the att acquisition also increased our site rental revenues from 2012 to 2013 by 14 based on initial run rate revenues from these acquisitions see item 7 mda—accounting and reporting matters—critical accounting policies and estimates  for a further discussion of our revenue recognition policies tenant additions were influenced by our customers upgrading to lte and their ongoing efforts to improve network quality and capacity see also item 1 business—the company—ccusa   

site rental gross margins for 2013  increased by 1871 million  or 12  from 2012  the increase in the site rental gross margins was related to the previously mentioned 19  increase in site rental revenues site rental gross margins for 2013  increased primarily as a result of 1 the high incremental margins associated with tenant additions given the relatively fixed costs to operate wireless infrastructure and 2 acquisitions the 1871 million  incremental margin represents 51 of the related increase in site rental revenues inclusive of impact of acquisitions 

network services and other gross margin for 2013 increased by 787 million  or 71  from 2012  the increase in our gross margin from our network services and other revenues is a reflection of the volume of activity from carrier network enhancements such as lte upgrades the increase in our market share and the general volatility in the volume and mix of network services work our network services offering is of a variable nature as these revenues are not under longterm contracts 

 26 

general and administrative expenses for 2013  increased by 286 million  or 15  from 2012  but decreased to 7  of net revenues in 2013 from 8  of net revenues in 2012 general and administrative expenses are inclusive of stockbased compensation charges see also note 13  to our consolidated financial statements the increase in general and administrative expenses in nominal dollars was commensurate with the growth in our business as a result of our acquisitions typically our general and administrative expenses do not significantly increase as a result of the colocation of additional tenants on our wireless infrastructure 

adjusted ebitda for 2013  increased by 2358 million  or 16  from 2012  adjusted ebitda was positively impacted by the growth in our site rental and network services activities and the 2012 acquisitions

net income loss attributable to ccic stockholders for 2013  was income of 765 million  compared to income of 1446 million  for 2012  the decrease in net income was predominately due to a change in our benefit provision for income taxes as discussed above partially offset by 1 the growth in our existing business 2 a decrease in interest expense and 3 a decrease in the net losses on the retirement of debt

liquidity and capital resources 

overview 

general  we believe our core business can be characterized as a stable cash flow stream generated by revenues under longterm contracts see item 7 mda—general overview—overview  since we became a public company in 1998 our cumulative net cash provided by operating activities net of cash interest payments has exceeded our capital expenditures and provided us with cash available for discretionary investments for the foreseeable future we expect to continue to generate net cash provided by operating activities that exceeds our expected 1 principal amortization payments 2 common and preferred dividend payments see notes 12  and 20 to our consolidated financial statements and 3 capital expenditures and we thus expect to have excess cash available for discretionary investments we seek to allocate the net cash provided by our operating activities in a manner that will enhance longterm stockholder value in addition to investing net cash provided by operating activities in certain circumstances we may also use debt financings and issuances of equity or equity related securities to fund discretionary investments such as for the 2012 acquisitions and the att acquisition 

we seek to maintain a capital structure that we believe drives longterm stockholder value and optimizes our weightedaverage cost of capital we target a leverage ratio of approximately four to six times adjusted ebitda and interest coverage of approximately three times adjusted ebitda subject to various factors such as the availability and cost of capital and the potential longterm return on our discretionary investments we may choose to increase or decrease our leverage or coverage from these targets for various periods of time 

effective january 1 2014 we commenced operating as a reit for us federal income tax purposes historically we have paid and we expect to continue to pay minimal cash income taxes as a result of our net operating loss carryforwards and our recent reit conversion see item 7 mda—general overview  and note 10  to our consolidated financial statements 

historically we have endeavored to utilize our net cash provided by operating activities to engage in discretionary investments our historical discretionary investments include in no particular order purchasing our common stock acquiring or constructing wireless infrastructure acquiring land interests under our towers improving and structurally enhancing our existing wireless infrastructure and purchasing repaying or redeeming our debt we expect to continue to utilize cash flow after dividends in a manner consistent with our past practice which we believe will maximize longterm stockholder value we seek to maintain flexibility in our discretionary investments with both net cash provided by operating activities and cash available from financing

 summary cash flows information   



operating activities 

the increase in net cash provided by operating activities for 2013  from 2012  and 2011  was due primarily to 1 growth in our core business including the 2012 acquisitions and a year over year incremental increase of 990 million in customer prepaid rent and 2 growth in our network services changes in working capital and particularly changes in accounts receivable deferred site rental receivables deferred rental revenues prepaid ground leases restricted cash and accrued interest can have a significant impact on net cash provided by operating activities largely due to the timing of prepayments and receipts we expect to grow our net cash provided by operating activities in the future exclusive of movements in working capital if we realize expected growth in our core business 

investing activities 

capital expenditures  we categorize our capital expenditures as sustaining or discretionary sustaining capital expenditures include capitalized costs related to 1 maintenance activities on our wireless infrastructure which are generally related to replacements and upgrades that extend the life of the asset 2 vehicles 3 information technology equipment and 4 office equipment discretionary capital expenditures which we also commonly refer to as revenuegenerating capital expenditures 

 30 

include 1 purchases of land interests under towers 2 wireless infrastructure improvements and structural enhancements in order to support additional site rentals and 3 the construction of wireless infrastructure 

a summary of our capital expenditures for the last three years is as follows   



our sustaining capital expenditures have historically been less than 2 of net revenues annually our discretionary capital expenditures are made with respect to activities which we believe exhibit sufficient potential to enhance longterm stockholder value we expect to use in excess of 500 million of our cash flows on capital expenditures sustaining and discretionary for full year 2014  our decisions regarding capital expenditures are influenced by the availability and cost of capital and expected returns on alternative uses of cash such as payments of dividends and investments the following is a discussion of certain aspects of our capital expenditures 

 acquisitions acquisitions consist of the acquisition of businesses such as towers small cells and third party land sites see notes 3  and 5  to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the att acquisition and the 2012 acquisitions 

financing activities 

we seek to allocate cash generated by our operations in a manner that will enhance longterm stockholder value which may include various financing activities such as in no particular order paying dividends on our common stock expected to be approximately 470 million in 2014 paying dividends on our 450 mandatory convertible preferred stock expected to be approximately 45 million in 2014 purchasing our common stock or purchasing repaying or redeeming our debt see notes 12  and 20 to our consolidated financial statements 

in 2012 our financing activities predominately related to the issuance and borrowing of an aggregate 65 billion of face value of debt which provided funding for the 2012 acquisitions as well as the refinancing of our credit facility and the repurchase and redemption of the 775 secured notes and the 9 senior notes which lowered our cost of debt in 2013 our financing activities predominately related to our october equity financings and our senior secured credit facility 2012 credit facility borrowings and amendments see item 7 mda—liquidity and capital resources—overview 

incurrence of debt   see note 7  to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our issuances of debt during 2012  and 2013  which extended the maturities of our debt portfolio provided funding for our acquisitions and lowered our cost of debt see item 7 mda—liquidity and capital resources—overview—liquidity position highlights of the security for our debt is as follows

preferred stock in october 2013 we issued 98 million shares of 450 mandatory convertible preferred stock the net proceeds of which were used to partially fund the att acquisition unless converted earlier each outstanding share of the 450 mandatory convertible preferred stock will automatically convert on november 1 2016 into between 10811 and 13513 shares of common stock depending on the applicable market value of the common stock and subject to certain antidilution adjustments 

in february 2012 we converted all of the outstanding 625 redeemable convertible preferred stock into common stock see note 11  to our consolidated financial statements 

revolving credit facility  in january 2012 we refinanced our previously outstanding credit facility with a new credit facility that consisted of a 10 billion revolving credit facility and 21 billion of term loan facilities as of december 31 2013  our term loan facilities were comprised of 6625 million of tranche a term loans and 29 billion of tranche b term loans the proceeds of the 2012 revolver may be used for general corporate purposes which may include the financing of capital expenditures acquisitions and purchases of our common stock see notes 3  and 5 to our consolidated financial statements typically we use the 2012 revolver to fund discretionary investments and not for operating activities such as working capital which are typically funded by net cash provided by operating activities as of february 14 2014  there is 3540 million  outstanding under our 15 billion revolving credit facility and there is 11 billion  of undrawn availability under the 2012 revolver during 2013 we repaid a total of 19 billion  which was primarily funded by our issuance of terms loans and borrowed 10 billion  under the 2012 revolver which was used to partially fund the att acquisition the weightedaverage interest rate as of december 31 2013  was 22  on the 2012 revolver see item 7 mda—liquidity and capital resources—overview 

restricted cash  pursuant to the indentures governing certain of our operating companies debt securities all rental cash receipts of the issuers of these debt instruments and their subsidiaries are restricted and held by an indenture trustee the restricted cash in excess of required reserve balances is subsequently released to us in accordance with the terms of the indentures during 2012 3166 million of restricted cash was held by the trustee in connection with the redemption of the 775 secured notes that amount was subsequently released in january 2013 when the 775 secured notes were redeemed in their entirety see also notes 2  and 7  to our consolidated financial statements 

contractual cash obligations 

the following table summarizes our contractual cash obligations as of december 31 2013  these contractual cash obligations relate primarily to our outstanding borrowings or lease obligations for land interests under our towers the debt maturities reflect contractual maturity dates and do not consider the impact of the principal payments that will commence following the anticipated repayment dates on the tower revenue notes see footnote c and the wcp securitized notes see footnote d   



 

  32 

 the following table summarizes our rights to the land interests under our towers including renewal terms at our option as of december 31 2013  as of december 31 2013  the leases for land interests under our towers had an average remaining life in excess of 30  years weighted based on site rental gross margin see item 1a risk factors   



  

 debt covenants 

our debt obligations contain covenants including 1 financial maintenance covenants 2 restrictive negative covenants or 3 other nonfinancial covenants these restrictive negative covenants place restrictions on ccic or our subsidiaries and may limit our ability to among other things incur debt and liens purchase our securities make capital expenditures dispose of assets undertake transactions with affiliates make other investments pay dividends or distribute excess cash flow see note 7  to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our debt covenants 

factors that are likely to determine our subsidiaries ability to comply with their current or future financial maintenance covenants include their 1 financial performance 2 levels of indebtedness or 3 debt service requirements given the current level of indebtedness and debt service requirements of our subsidiaries the primary risk of a financial maintenance covenant violation would be from a deterioration of a subsidiarys financial performance if we fail to comply with our financial maintenance covenants we will be in default under our debt agreements which could cause the maturity of a substantial portion of our longterm indebtedness to be accelerated or limit our access to additional borrowings under these debt agreements as long as such covenant violation continues if certain of our operating subsidiaries were to default on the debt the trustee could seek to pursue the collateral securing the debt in which case we could lose the wireless infrastructure and the future cash flows associated with 

 33

accounting and reporting matters 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the following is a discussion of the accounting policies and estimates that we believe 1 are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations or 2 require our most difficult subjective or complex judgments often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain the critical accounting policies and estimates for 2013  are not intended to be a comprehensive list of our accounting policies and estimates see note 2  to our consolidated financial statements for a summary of our significant accounting policies in many cases the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by gaap in other cases management is required to exercise judgment in the application of accounting principles with respect to particular transactions 

revenue recognition   83  of our total revenue for 2013  consists of site rental revenues which are recognized on a monthly basis over the fixed noncancelable term of the relevant contract generally ranging from five to 15 years regardless of whether the payments from the customer are received in equal monthly amounts if the payment terms call for fixed escalations as in fixed dollar or fixed percentage increases prepaid rent or rent free periods the revenue is recognized on a straightline basis over the fixed noncancelable term of the contract when calculating our straightline rental revenues we consider all fixed elements of tenant contractual escalation provisions even if such escalation provisions contain a variable element such as an escalator tied to an inflationbased index in addition to a minimum to the extent we acquire belowmarket tenant leases for contractual interests with tenants on the acquired wireless infrastructure for example with respect to small cells we record deferred credits and amortize such deferred credits to site rental revenues over their estimated lease term since we recognize revenue on a straightline basis a portion of the site rental revenue in a given period represents cash collected or contractually collectible in other periods our assets related to straightline site rental revenues are included in other current assets and deferred site rental receivables net amounts billed or received prior to being earned commonly referred to as prepaid rent are deferred and reflected in deferred revenues and deferred credits and other liabilities see note 2  to our consolidated financial statements 

we provide network services relating to our wireless infrastructure which represent approximately 17  of our total revenues for 2013  network services and other revenue relate to installation services as well as the following additional site development 

 35 

services relating to existing or new antenna installations on our wireless infrastructure site acquisition architectural and engineering zoning or permitting fiber installations other construction or other services related to network development network services revenues are recognized after completion of the applicable service we account for network services separately from the customers site rental 

see item 1 business—ccusa  for a further discussion of our business 

accounting for acquisitions — general as described in  item 1 business  much of our wireless infrastructure has been acquired in various transactions from the four largest us wireless carriers or their predecessors through transactions consummated since 1999 we evaluate each of our acquisitions to determine if it should be accounted for as a business combination or as an acquisition of assets for our business combinations we allocate the purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair value at the date of acquisition any purchase price in excess of the net fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is allocated to goodwill see accounting for acquisitions  valuation below 

the determination of the final purchase price allocation could extend over several quarters resulting in the use of preliminary estimates that are subject to adjustment until finalized such changes could have a significant impact on our financial statements and could result in retrospective changes in results reported for the acquired business in prior periods in accordance with gaap as of december 31 2013  the purchase price allocation for the att acquisition is preliminary and subject to change including as result of the finalization of the valuation of certain tangible and intangible assets and certain liabilities 

accounting for acquisitions — leases with respect to business combinations that include towers that we lease and operate such as the tmobile sprint and att leased and subleased towers we evaluate such agreements to determine treatment as capital or operating leases the evaluation of such agreements for capital or operating lease treatment includes consideration of each of the lease classification criteria under asc 8401025 namely 1 the transfer of ownership provisions 2 the existence of bargain purchase options 3 the length of the remaining lease term and 4 the present value of the minimum lease payments with respect to the att acquisition tmobile acquisition and the sprint towers acquired in the acquisition of global signal we determined that the tower leases were capital leases and the underlying land leases were operating leases based upon the lease term criterion after considering the fragmentation criteria applicable under asc 8401025 to leases involving both land and buildings ie towers we determined that the fragmentation criteria was met and the tower leases could be accounted for as capital leases apart from the land leases which are accounted for as operating leases since 1 the fair value of the land in both business combinations was greater than 25 of the total fair value of the leased property at inception and 2 the tower lease expirations occur beyond 75 of the estimated economic life of the tower assets 

accounting for acquisitions — valuation  as of december 31 2013  our largest asset was property and equipment which primarily consists of wireless infrastructure followed by intangible assets and goodwill approximately 41 billion  and 49 billion  in net book value respectively approximately 37 billion  net book value at december 31 2013  of our identifiable intangibles relate to the site rental contracts and customer relationships intangible assets see note 2  to our consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the nature and composition of the site rental contracts and customer relationships intangible assets 

the fair value of the vast majority of our assets and liabilities is determined by using either 

 the purchase price allocation requires subjective estimates that if incorrectly estimated could be material to our consolidated financial statements including the amount of depreciation amortization and accretion expense the most important estimates for measurement of tangible fixed assets are 1 the cost to replace the asset with a new asset and 2 the economic useful life after giving effect to age quality and condition the most important estimates for measurement of intangible assets are 1 discount rates and 2 timing and amount of cash flows including estimates regarding customer renewals and cancellations the most important estimates for measurement of above and belowmarket leases is the determination of 1 favorablility or unfavorability to the current market terms and 2 applicable lease term including whether renewals or extensions should be measured with respect to business combinations that include towers that we lease and operate such as the tmobile sprint and att leased and subleased towers we evaluate such agreements to determine treatment as capital or operating leases and identification of any bargain purchase options 

 36 

we record the fair value of obligations to perform certain asset retirement activities including requirements pursuant to our ground leases or easements to remove wireless infrastructure or remediate the land upon which our wireless infrastructure resides in determining the fair value of these asset retirement obligations we must make several subjective and highly judgmental estimates such as those related to 1 timing of cash flows 2 future costs 3 discount rates and 4 the probability of enforcement to remove the wireless infrastructure or remediate the land see note 2  to our consolidated financial statements 

accounting for longlived assets — useful lives  we are required to make subjective assessments as to the useful lives of our tangible and intangible assets for purposes of determining depreciation amortization and accretion expense that if incorrectly estimated could be material to our consolidated financial statements depreciation expense for our property and equipment is computed using the straightline method over the estimated useful lives of our various classes of tangible assets the substantial portion of our property and equipment represents the cost of our wireless infrastructure which is depreciated with an estimated useful life equal to the shorter of 1 20 years or 2 the term of the lease including optional renewals for the land interests under the wireless infrastructure 

the useful life of our intangible assets is estimated based on the period over which the intangible asset is expected to benefit us and gives consideration to the expected useful life of other assets to which the useful life may relate amortization expense for intangible assets is computed using the straightline method over the estimated useful life of each of the intangible assets the useful life of the site rental contracts and customer relationships intangible assets is limited by the maximum depreciable life of the wireless infrastructure 20 years as a result of the interdependency of the wireless infrastructure and site rental contracts and customer relationships in contrast the site rental contracts and customer relationships are estimated to provide economic benefits for several decades because of the low rate of customer cancellations and high rate of renewals experienced to date thus while site rental contracts and customer relationships are valued based upon the fair value of the site rental contracts and customer relationships which includes assumptions regarding both 1 customers exercise of optional renewals contained in the acquired contracts and 2 renewals of the acquired contracts past the contractual term including exercisable options the site rental contracts are amortized over a period not to exceed 20 years as a result of the useful life being limited by the depreciable life of the wireless infrastructure 

accounting for longlived assets — impairment evaluation — intangibles  we review the carrying values of property and equipment intangible assets or other longlived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable we utilize the following dual grouping policy for purposes of determining the unit of account for testing impairment of the site rental contracts and customer relationships 

 we first pool site rental contracts and customer relationships intangible assets and property and equipment into portfolio groups for purposes of determining the unit of account for impairment testing because we view wireless infrastructure as portfolios and wireless infrastructure in a given portfolio and its related customer contracts are not largely independent of the other wireless infrastructure in the portfolio we reevaluate the appropriateness of the pooled groups at least annually this use of grouping is based in part on 1 our limitations regarding disposal of wireless infrastructure 2 the interdependencies of wireless infrastructure portfolios and 3 the manner in which wireless infrastructure is traded in the marketplace the vast majority of our site rental contracts and customer relationships intangible assets and property and equipment are pooled into the us owned wireless infrastructure group secondly and separately we pool site rental contracts and customer relationships by significant customer or by customer grouping for individually insignificant customers as appropriate for purposes of determining the unit of account for impairment testing because we associate the value ascribed to site rental contracts and customer relationships intangible assets to the underlying contracts and related customer relationships acquired 

our determination that an adverse event or change in circumstance has occurred that indicates that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable will generally involve 1 a deterioration in an assets financial performance compared to historical results 2 a shortfall in an assets financial performance compared to forecasted results or 3 changes affecting the utility and estimated future demands for the asset when considering the utility of our assets we consider events that would meaningfully impact 1 our wireless infrastructure or 2 our customer relationships for example consideration would be given to events that impact 1 the structural integrity and longevity of our wireless infrastructure or 2 our ability to derive benefit from our existing customer relationships including events such as bankruptcy or insolvency or loss of a significant customer during 2013  there were no events or circumstances that caused us to review the carrying value of our intangible assets or property and equipment due in part to our assets performing consistently with or better than our expectations 

 37 

if the sum of the estimated future cash flows undiscounted from an asset or portfolio group significant customer or customer group for individually insignificant customers as applicable is less than its carrying amount an impairment loss may be recognized if the carrying value were to exceed the undiscounted cash flows measurement of an impairment loss would be based on the fair value of the asset which is based on an estimate of discounted future cash flows the most important estimates for such calculations of undiscounted cash flows are 1 the expected additions of new tenants and equipment on our wireless infrastructure and 2 estimates regarding customer cancellations and renewals of contracts we could record impairments in the future if changes in longterm market conditions expected future operating results or the utility of the assets results in changes for our impairment test calculations which negatively impact the fair value of our property and equipment and intangible assets or if we changed our unit of account in the future 

when grouping assets into pools for purposes of impairment evaluation we also consider individual towers nodes and third party land interests within a grouping for which we currently have no tenants approximately 2  of our total towers currently have no tenants we continue to pay operating expenses on these towers in anticipation of obtaining tenants on these towers in the future primarily because of the individual tower site demographics we estimate based on current visibility potential tenants on over half of these towers to the extent we do not believe there are longterm prospects of obtaining tenants on an individual tower node or third party land interest and all other possible avenues for recovering the carrying value has been exhausted including sale of the asset we appropriately reduce the carrying value of such assets to fair value 

accounting for longlived assets — impairment evaluation — goodwill   nearly all of our goodwill is recorded at ccusa we test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis regardless of whether adverse events or changes in circumstances have occurred the annual test begins with goodwill and all intangible assets being allocated to applicable reporting units we then perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount if it is concluded that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount it is necessary to perform the twostep goodwill impairment test otherwise the twostep goodwill impairment test is not required our reporting units are the operating segments ccusa and ccal since segment management operates their respective wireless infrastructure portfolios as a single network 

we performed our most recent annual goodwill impairment test as of october 1 2013 which resulted in no impairments this assessment included consideration of our market capitalization which exceeded over three times the aggregate carrying amount of the reporting units as of december 31 2013  

deferred income taxes  we record deferred income tax assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet related to events that impact our financial statements and tax returns in different periods in order to compute these deferred tax balances we first analyze the differences between the book basis and tax basis of our assets and liabilities referred to as temporary differences these temporary differences are then multiplied by current tax rates to arrive at the balances for the deferred income tax assets and liabilities a valuation allowance is provided on deferred tax assets that do not meet the more likely than not realization threshold we recognize a tax position if it is more likely than not it will be sustained upon examination the tax position is measured at the largest amount that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 

if our expectations about the future tax consequences of past events should prove to be inaccurate the balances of our deferred income tax assets and liabilities could require significant adjustments in future periods our ability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards is dependent in part upon our having sufficient future earnings to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards before they expire if market conditions change materially and we determine that we will be unable to generate sufficient taxable income in the future to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards we would be required to record an additional valuation allowance which would reduce our earnings such adjustments could cause a material effect on our results of operations for the period of the adjustment the change in our valuation allowance has no effect on our cash flows 

from and after january 1 2014 the date on which we commenced operating as a reit we generally will not be subject to us federal corporate income tax to the extent we distribute our reit taxable income to our stockholders as a result while we will still be permitted to use nols to offset reit taxable income we do not expect to pay taxes on our reit taxable income and therefore we do not expect to be able to realize such deferred tax assets we will also have trss consisting of our tower operations in australia and initially our small cells  that will continue to be subject as applicable to federal and state corporate income taxes and to foreign taxes in the jurisdictions in which such assets and operations are located

nongaap financial measures 

our measurement of profit or loss currently used to evaluate the operating performance of our operating segments is earnings before interest taxes depreciation amortization and accretion as adjusted or adjusted ebitda our definition of adjusted ebitda is set forth in item 7 mda—results of operations—comparison of operating segments    our measure of adjusted ebitda may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies including companies in the tower sector and other similar providers of wireless infrastructure and is not a measure of performance calculated in accordance with gaap adjusted ebitda should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for operating income or loss net income or loss net cash provided by used for operating investing and financing activities or other income statement or cash flow statement data prepared in accordance with gaap 

we believe adjusted ebitda is useful to an investor in evaluating our operating performance because 

 our management uses adjusted ebitda 

 there are material limitations to using a measure such as adjusted ebitda including the difficulty associated with comparing results among more than one company including our competitors and the inability to analyze certain significant items including depreciation and interest expense that directly affect our net income or loss management compensates for these limitations by considering the economic effect of the excluded expense items independently as well as in connection with their analysis of net income loss 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

our primary exposures to market risks are related to changes in interest rates or foreign currency exchange rates which may adversely affect our results of operations and financial position we seek to manage exposure to changes in interest rates where economically prudent to do so by utilizing fixed rate debt we do not currently hedge against foreign currency exchange risks 

 39 

interest rate risk 

our interest rate risk relates primarily to the impact of interest rate movements on the following 

 potential refinancing of existing debt 

over the next 12 months we have no debt maturities other than principal payments on amortizing debt we do not anticipate the need to access the capital markets to refinance our existing debt until at least 2015 as of december 31 2013  and december 31 2012  we had no interest rate swaps hedging any refinancings see item 7 mda—liquidity and capital resources—overview   

floating rate debt 

we manage our exposure to market interest rates on our existing debt by controlling the mix of fixed and floating rate debt as of december 31 2013  we had 39 billion  of floating rate debt which included 29 billion of debt with a libor floor of 075 per annum as a result a hypothetical unfavorable fluctuation in market interest rates on our existing debt of 18 of a percent point over a 12month period would increase our interest expense by approximately 1 million when giving effect to our libor floor and would increase our interest expense by approximately 5 million exclusive of the impact of the libor floor as of december 31 2012 we had 33 billion of floating rate debt which included 16 billion of debt with a libor floor of 1 per annum 

potential future borrowings of incremental debt 

we typically do not hedge our exposure to interest rates on potential future borrowings of incremental debt for a substantial period prior to issuance see item 7 mda—liquidity and capital resources  regarding our liquidity strategy 

 40 

the following table provides information about our market risk related to changes in interest rates the future principal payments and weightedaverage interest rates are presented as of december 31 2013  these debt maturities reflect contractual maturity dates and do not consider the impact of the principal payments that will commence following the anticipated repayment dates of certain notes see footnote c see note 7  to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our debt 



   

 

 41 

foreign currency risk 

the vast majority of our foreign currency risk is related to the australian dollar which is the functional currency of ccal ccal represented 5  and 6 respectively of our consolidated revenues and 4  and 4 respectively of our consolidated operating income for 2013  and 2012 see item 7 mda—results of operations—comparison of operating segments foreign exchange markets have recently been volatile and we expect foreign exchange markets to continue to be volatile over the near term we believe the risk related to our financial instruments exclusive of intercompany financing deemed a longterm investment denominated in australian dollars is not significant to our financial condition a hypothetical increase or decrease of 25 in australian dollar exchange rate would increase or decrease the fair value of our financial instruments by approximately 8 million

overview 

we own operate and lease shared wireless infrastructure including 1 towers and other structures such as rooftops collectively towers and to a lesser extent 2 distributed antenna systems das a type of small cell network small cells and 3 interests in land under third party towers in various forms third party land interests collectively wireless infrastructure our core business is providing access including space or capacity to our towers and to a lesser extent to our small cells and third party land interests via longterm contracts in various forms including license sublease and lease agreements collectively contracts our wireless infrastructure can accommodate multiple customers colocation for antennas and other equipment necessary for the transmission of signals for wireless communication devices we seek to increase our site rental revenues by adding more tenants on our wireless infrastructure which we expect to result in significant incremental cash flows due to our relatively fixed operating costs 

certain information concerning our business as of december 31 2012  is as follows 

 certain information concerning our customers and site rental contracts as of december 31 2012  is as follows 

 to a lesser extent we also provide certain network services relating to our wireless infrastructure primarily consisting of antenna installations and subsequent augmentations as well as additional site development services relating to our wireless infrastructure 

strategy 

our strategy is to increase longterm stockholder value by translating anticipated future growth in our core business into growth of our results on a per share basis we believe our strategy is consistent with our mission to deliver the highest level of service to our customers at all times – striving to be their critical partner as we assist them in growing efficient ubiquitous wireless networks the key elements of our strategy are to 

 our longterm strategy is based on our belief that additional demand for our wireless infrastructure will be created by the expected continued growth in the wireless communications industry which is predominately driven by the demand for wireless voice and data services by consumers we believe that additional demand for wireless infrastructure will create future growth opportunities for us we believe that such demand for our wireless infrastructure will continue will result in organic growth of our cash flows due to new tenant additions on our existing wireless infrastructure and will create other growth opportunities for us such as demand for new wireless infrastructure 

during 2012  consumer demand for wireless data services continued to grow as consumer demand for wireless devices such as smartphones tablets and laptops increased demand for voice services remained relatively constant this growth in wireless data services is driven by increased mobile video mobile internet usage and machinetomachine applications we expect that consumers growing demands for network speed and quality will likely result in wireless carriers continuing their focus on improving network quality and expanding capacity by adding additional antennas and other equipment for the transmission of their services to wireless infrastructure or to their existing wireless networks in an effort to improve customer retention and satisfaction our customers have introduced and we believe they plan to continue to deploy next generation wireless technologies including 3g and 4g in response to consumer demand for high speed networks we expect these next generation technologies and others including longterm evolution lte to translate into additional demand for wireless infrastructure although the timing and rate of this growth is difficult to predict 

2012  highlights and recent developments 

see item 7 mda  and our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of developments and activities that occurred in 2012  including issuances repurchases and redemptions of debt and the consummation of several acquisitions including the acquisition wcp acquisition of certain subsidiaries of wireless capital partners llc wcp the acquisition nextg acquisition of nextg networks inc nextg and the acquisition tmobile acquisition of rights to towers from tmobile in addition see item 7 mda  and notes 6 and 20 of our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of subsequent events occurring in 2013 through the date of this filing including the repurchase or redemption in january 2013 of the 9 senior notes and the 775 secured notes that remained outstanding as of december 31 2012 january 2013 debt retirements 

the company 

virtually all of our operations are located in the us and australia we conduct substantially all of our operations through subsidiaries of crown castle operating company ccoc including 1 certain subsidiaries which operate our wireless infrastructure portfolios in the us and 2 a 776 owned subsidiary that operates our australia tower portfolio for more information about our operating segments as well as financial information about the geographic areas in which we operate see note 16  to our consolidated financial statements and item 7 mda   

ccusa 

site rental  the core business of ccusa is providing access to our wireless infrastructure we predominately provide access to wireless carriers under longterm contracts for their antennas which transmit a variety of signals related to wireless voice and data we believe our wireless infrastructure is integral to our customers networks and their ability to serve their customers 

we acquired ownership interests or exclusive rights to most of our towers from the four largest wireless carriers or their predecessors through transactions consummated since 1999 including 1 approximately 7100 towers from tmobile in 2012 2 approximately 10700 towers from global signal inc global signal in 2007 of which approximately 6600 were originally acquired from sprint 3 approximately 4800 towers during 1999 to 2000 from companies now part of verizon wireless 4 approximately 2700 towers during 1999 to 2000 from companies now part of att as well as 5 other smaller acquisitions from companies now part of tmobile and other independent tower operators our small cells were predominately acquired through the acquisitions of nextg in 2012 and newpath networks inc newpath in 2010 

we generally receive monthly rental payments from tenants payable under longterm contracts we have existing master lease agreements with most wireless carriers including verizon wireless att sprint and tmobile such agreements provide certain terms including economic terms that govern contracts on our towers entered into by such carriers during the term of their master lease agreements over the last several years we have negotiated up to 15year terms for both initial and renewal periods for certain of our customers which often included fixed escalations we continue to endeavor to negotiate with our existing customer base for longer contractual terms which often may contain fixed escalation rates 

our customer contracts have historically had a high renewal rate because 1 our wireless infrastructure is integral to our customers networks 2 it is generally financially unattractive for our customers to relocate their antennas and other equipment to other wireless infrastructure or to construct new wireless infrastructure and 3 zoning and other barriers may preclude our customers from constructing new wireless infrastructure with limited exceptions the customer contracts may not be terminated prior to the end of their current term in general each customer contract which is renewable will automatically renew at the end of its term unless the customer provides prior notice of its intent not to renew see note 15  to our consolidated financial statements for a tabular presentation of the minimum rental cash payments due to us by tenants pursuant to contract agreements without consideration of tenant renewal options 

the average monthly rental payment of a new tenant added to wireless infrastructure can vary based on 1 the different regions in the us 2 aggregate customer volume and 3 the type of signal transmitted by the tenant primarily as a result of the physical size of the antenna installation and related equipment in addition with respect to our small cells the amount of the monthly payments can also be influenced by 1 the cost of installation including with respect to the fiber and 2 the amount of upfront payments received we also routinely receive rental payment increases in connection with contract amendments pursuant to which our customers add additional antennas or other equipment to wireless infrastructure on which they already have equipment pursuant to preexisting contract agreements 

approximately twothirds of our direct site operating expenses consist of lease expenses and the remainder includes property taxes repairs and maintenance employee compensation and related benefit costs and utilities our cash operating expenses tend to escalate at approximately the rate of inflation partially offset by reductions in cash lease expenses from our purchases of land interests as a result of the relatively fixed nature of these expenditures the colocation of additional tenants is achieved at a low incremental operating cost resulting in high incremental operating cash flows our wireless infrastructure portfolio requires minimal sustaining capital expenditures including maintenance and other nondiscretionary capital expenditures and are typically less than 2 of site rental revenues or an annual average over the last three years of approximately 30 million see note 15  to our consolidated financial statements for a tabular presentation of the rental cash payments owed by us to landlords pursuant to our contractual agreements 

network services  to a lesser extent we also offer wireless communication companies and their agents certain network services relating to our wireless infrastructure for 2012  48 of network services and other revenues related to customer equipment installations and subsequent augmentation collectively installation services and the remainder related to the following additional site development services site acquisition architectural and engineering zoning and permitting fiber installations other construction and other services related to network development we have grown our network service revenues over the last several years as a result of our focus on customer service increasing our market share for installation services on our wireless infrastructure promoting site development services expanding the scope of our services and engaging in an increased volume resulting from carrier network upgrades we have the capability and expertise to install with the assistance of our network of subcontractors equipment and antenna systems for our customers we do not always provide the installation or site development services on our wireless infrastructure as third parties also provide these services see also  —competition  below these activities are typically nonrecurring and highly competitive with a number of local competitors in most markets nearly all of our antenna installation services are billed on a costplus profit basis 

customers  we work extensively with large national wireless carriers and in general our customers are primarily comprised of providers of wireless voice and data services who operate national or regional networks the following table summarizes the net revenues from our four largest customers expressed as a percentage of our consolidated revenues for 2012  see item 1a risk factors 



sales and marketing  our sales organization markets our wireless infrastructure within the wireless communications industry with the objectives of providing access to existing wireless infrastructure and to new wireless infrastructure prior to construction as well as obtaining network services related to our wireless infrastructure we seek to become the critical partner and preferred independent wireless infrastructure provider for our customers and increase customer satisfaction relative to our peers by leveraging our 1 customer relationships 2 process centric approach and 3 technological tools 

a team of national account directors maintains our relationships with our largest customers these directors work to develop wireless infrastructure leasing and network service opportunities as well as to ensure that customers wireless infrastructure needs are efficiently translated into new leases on our wireless infrastructure sales personnel in our area offices develop and maintain local relationships with our customers that are expanding their networks entering new markets bringing new technologies to market or requiring maintenance or addon business in addition to our fulltime sales and marketing staff a number of senior managers and officers spend a significant portion of their time on sales and marketing activities and call on existing and prospective customers 

we use public and proprietary databases to develop targeted marketing programs focused on carrier network expansions including das and related network services we attempt to match specific wireless infrastructure in our portfolio with potential new site demand by obtaining and analyzing information including our customers existing antenna locations tenant contracts marketing strategies capital spend plans deployment status and actual wireless carrier signal strength measurements taken in the field we have developed a webbased tool that stores key wireless infrastructure information above and beyond normal property management information including data on actual customer signal strength demographics site readiness and competitive structures in addition the webbased tool assists us in estimating potential demand for our wireless infrastructure with greater speed and accuracy we believe these and other tools we have developed assist our customers in their site selection and deployment of their wireless networks and provide us with an opportunity to have proactive discussions with them regarding their wireless infrastructure deployment plans and the timing and location of their demand for our wireless infrastructure a key aspect to our sales and marketing strategy is a continued emphasis on our processcentric approach to reduce cycle time related to new leasing and amendments which helps provide our customers with faster deployment of their networks 

competition  we compete with 1 other independent tower owners which also provide site rental and network services 2 wireless carriers which build own and operate their own tower networks and lease space to other wireless communication companies and 3 owners of alternative infrastructure including rooftops water towers broadcast towers utility poles das and other small cells some of the larger independent tower companies with which we compete in the us include american tower corporation and sba communications corporation in addition some wireless carriers own and operate their own tower networks and certain of such carriers are larger and have greater financial resources than we have we believe that tower location and capacity deployment speed quality of service and price have been and will continue to be the most significant competitive factors affecting the leasing of wireless infrastructure 

competitors in our network services offering include site acquisition consultants zoning consultants real estate firms rightofway consulting firms construction companies tower owners and managers radio frequency engineering consultants telecommunications equipment vendors who can provide turnkey site development services through multiple subcontractors and our customers internal staff we believe that our customers base their decisions on the outsourcing of network services on criteria such as a companys experience track record local reputation price and time for completion of a project 

ccal 

our primary business in australia is providing access to antenna space on towers to our customers we own 776 of ccal ccal is the largest independent tower operator in australia as of december 31 2012  ccal had approximately 1700  towers with 56  of such towers located in seven major metropolitan areas the majority of ccals towers were acquired from optus 

in 2000 and vodafone in 2001 ccal also provides a range of services including site maintenance and property management services for towers owned by third parties 

for 2012  ccal comprised 6  of our consolidated net revenues ccals principal customers are telstra optus and vha which collectively accounted for approximately 90 of ccals 2012 revenues during 2012 the australian government continued the development and roll out of the national broadband network nbn nbn is a national highspeed openaccess data network under development targeting nearly all australian premises and includes a fixed wireless broadband network expected to be deployed by 2015 we believe that the continued development of nbn may result in additional future demand for new tenant additions on ccals existing towers and construction of new towers 

in australia ccal competes with wireless carriers which own and operate their own tower networks service companies that provide site maintenance and property management services and other site owners such as broadcasters and building owners the other significant tower owners in australia are broadcast australia an independent operator of broadcast towers and telstra and optus wireless carriers we believe that tower location capacity quality of service deployment speed and price within a geographic market are the most significant competitive factors affecting the leasing of wireless infrastructure in australia 

employees 

at january 31 2013  we employed approximately 1600 people worldwide including approximately 1500 in the us we are not a party to any collective bargaining agreements we have not experienced any strikes or work stoppages and management believes that our employee relations are satisfactory 

regulatory and environmental matters 

to date we have not incurred any material fines or penalties or experienced any material adverse effects to our business as a result of any domestic or international regulations the summary below is based on regulations currently in effect and such regulations are subject to review and modification by the applicable governmental authority from time to time if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations we may be fined or even lose our rights to conduct some of our business 

united states 

 we are required to comply with a variety of federal state and local regulations and laws in the us including federal communications commission fcc and federal aviation administration faa regulations and those discussed under —environmental  below 

federal regulations  both the fcc and the faa regulate towers used for wireless communications radio and television broadcasting such regulations control the siting lighting and marking of towers and may depending on the characteristics of particular towers require the registration of tower facilities with the fcc and the issuance of determinations confirming no hazard to air traffic wireless communications devices operating on towers are separately regulated and independently licensed based upon the particular frequency used in addition the fcc and the faa have developed standards to consider proposals for new or modified tower and antenna structures based upon the height and location including proximity to airports proposals to construct or to modify existing tower and antenna structures above certain heights are reviewed by the faa to ensure the structure will not present a hazard to aviation which determination may be conditioned upon compliance with lighting and marking requirements the fcc requires its licensees to operate communications devices only on towers that comply with faa rules and are registered with the fcc if required by its regulations where tower lighting is required by faa regulation tower owners bear the responsibility of notifying the faa of any tower lighting outage and ensuring the timely restoration of such outages failure to comply with the applicable requirements may lead to civil penalties 

local regulations  the us telecommunications act of 1996 amended the communications act of 1934 to preserve state and local zoning authorities jurisdiction over the siting of communications towers and das the law however limits local zoning authority by prohibiting actions by local authorities that discriminate between different service providers of wireless services or ban altogether the provision of wireless services additionally the law prohibits state and local restrictions based on the environmental effects of radio frequency emissions to the extent the facilities comply with fcc regulations 

local regulations include city and other local ordinances including subdivision and zoning ordinances approvals for construction modification and removal of towers and das and restrictive covenants imposed by community developers these regulations vary greatly but typically require us to obtain approval from local officials prior to tower construction local zoning authorities may render decisions that prevent the construction or modification of towers or place conditions on such construction or modifications that are responsive to community residents concerns regarding the height visibility and other characteristics of the towers to expedite the deployment of wireless networks the fcc issued a declaratory ruling in 2009 which is currently under appeal establishing timeframes for the review of applications by local and state governments of 90 days for colocations and 150 

days for new tower construction the middle class tax relief and job creation act of 2012 mandates that state and local governments must approve an eligible facilitys request for the modification of an existing tower that does not substantially change the dimensions of such tower notwithstanding the fcc declaratory ruling and recent legislation decisions of local zoning authorities may also adversely affect the timing and cost of wireless infrastructure construction and modification 

some of our das related subsidiaries hold authorization to provide intrastate telecommunication services as competitive local exchange carriers clec in numerous states and to provide domestic interstate telecommunication services as authorized by the fcc these das subsidiaries are primarily regulated by state public service commissions which have jurisdiction over public rightsofway clec status in certain cases helps promote access to such public rightsofway which is beneficial to the deployment of our das on a timely basis status as a clec often allows us to deploy our das systems in locations where zoning restrictions might otherwise delay restrict or prevent building or expanding traditional wireless tower sites and traditional wireless rooftop sites 

environmental we are required to comply with a variety of federal state and local environmental laws and regulations protecting environmental quality including air and water quality and wildlife protection to date we have not incurred any material fines or penalties or experienced any material adverse effects to our business as a result of any domestic or international environmental regulations or matters see item 1a risk factors 

the construction of new towers and in some cases the modification of existing towers in the us may be subject to environmental review under the national environmental policy act of 1969 as amended nepa which requires federal agencies to evaluate the environmental impact of major federal actions the fcc has promulgated regulations implementing nepa which require applicants to investigate the potential environmental impact of the proposed tower construction should the proposed tower construction present a significant environmental impact the fcc must prepare an environmental impact statement subject to public comment if the proposed construction or modification of a tower may have a significant impact on the environment the fccs approval of the construction or modification could be significantly delayed 

our operations are subject to federal state and local laws and regulations relating to the management use storage disposal emission and remediation of and exposure to hazardous and nonhazardous substances materials and wastes as an owner lessee or operator of real property we are subject to certain environmental laws that impose strict jointandseveral liability for the cleanup of onsite or offsite contamination relating to existing or historical operations and we could also be subject to personal injury or property damage claims relating to such contamination in general our customer contracts prohibit our customers from using or storing any hazardous substances on our tower sites in violation of applicable environmental laws and require our customers to provide notice of certain environmental conditions caused by them 

as licensees and wireless infrastructure owners we are also subject to regulations and guidelines that impose a variety of operational requirements relating to radio frequency emissions as employers we are subject to occupational safety and health administration and similar occupational health and safety legislation in australia and similar guidelines regarding employee protection from radio frequency exposure the potential connection between radio frequency emissions and certain negative health effects including some forms of cancer has been the subject of substantial study by the scientific community in recent years 

we have compliance programs and monitoring projects to help assure that we are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws nevertheless there can be no assurance that the costs of compliance with existing or future environmental laws will not have a material adverse effect on us 

other regulations  we hold through certain of our subsidiaries licenses for common carrier microwave service which are subject to additional regulation by the fcc our fcc license relating to our 16701675 mhz us nationwide spectrum license spectrum contains certain conditions related to the services that may be provided thereunder the technical equipment used in connection therewith and the circumstances under which it may be renewed in 2007 after receiving fcc approval we entered into a longterm lease of the spectrum with an initial term through 2013 

australia 

federal regulations  carrier licenses and nominated carrier declarations issued under the australian telecommunications act 1997 authorize the use of network units for the supply of telecommunications services to the public the definition of “network units” includes line links and base stations used for wireless voice services but does not include tower infrastructure accordingly ccal as a tower owner and operator does not require a carrier license under the australian telecommunications act 1997 similarly because ccal does not own any transmitters or spectrum it does not currently require any apparatus or spectrum licenses issued under the australian radiocommunications act 1992 

carriers have a statutory obligation to provide other carriers with access to towers and if there is a dispute including a pricing dispute the matter may be referred to the australian competition and consumer commission for resolution as a noncarrier ccal is not subject to this requirement and our customers negotiate site access on a commercial basis 

while the australian telecommunications act 1997 grants certain exemptions from planning laws for the installation of low impact facilities newly constructed towers are expressly excluded from the definition of low impact facilities accordingly in connection with the construction of towers ccal is subject to state and local planning laws that vary on a site by site basis typically requiring us to obtain approval from local government agencies prior to tower construction subject to certain exceptions structural enhancements may be undertaken on behalf of a carrier without state and local planning approval under the general maintenance power under the australian telecommunications act 1997 although these enhancements may be subject to state and local planning laws if ccal is unable to obtain carrier cooperation to use such power for a limited number of towers ccal is also required to install aircraft warning lighting in compliance with federal aviation regulations in australia a carrier may arguably be able to utilize the maintenance power under the australian telecommunications act 1997 to remain as a tenant on a tower after the expiration of a site license or sublease however ccals customer access agreements generally limit the ability of customers to do this and even if a carrier did utilize this power the carrier would be required to pay for ccals financial loss which would roughly equal the site rental revenues that would have otherwise been payable 

local regulations  in australia there are various local state and territory laws and regulations which relate to among other things town planning and zoning restrictions standards and approvals for the design construction or alteration of a structure or facility and environmental regulations as in the us these laws vary greatly but typically require tower owners to obtain approval from governmental bodies prior to tower construction and to comply with environmental laws on an ongoing basis 




 item 1a risk factors 

you should carefully consider all of the risks described below as well as the other information contained in this document when evaluating your investment in our securities 

our business depends on the demand for wireless communications and wireless infrastructure and we may be adversely affected by any slowdown in such demand additionally a reduction in carrier network investment may materially and adversely affect our business including reducing demand for new tenant additions and network services 

demand for our wireless infrastructure depends on the demand for antenna space from our customers which in turn depends on the demand for wireless voice and data services by their customers the willingness of our customers to utilize our wireless infrastructure or renew or extend existing contracts on our wireless infrastructure is affected by numerous factors including 

 a slowdown in demand for wireless communications or our wireless infrastructure may negatively impact our growth or otherwise have a material adverse effect on us if our customers or potential customers are unable to raise adequate capital to fund their business plans as a result of disruptions in the financial and credit markets or otherwise they may reduce their spending which could adversely affect our anticipated growth and the demand for our wireless infrastructure and network services 

historically the amount of our customers network investment is cyclical and has varied based upon the various matters described in these risk factors changes in carrier network investment typically impact the demand for our wireless infrastructure as a result changes in carrier plans such as delays in the implementation of new systems new technologies including with respect to the use of small cells or plans to expand coverage or capacity may reduce demand for our wireless infrastructure furthermore the wireless communication industry could experience a slowdown or slowing growth rates as a result of numerous factors including a reduction in consumer demand for wireless services and general economic conditions there can be no assurances that weakness and uncertainty in the economic environment will not adversely impact the wireless communications industry which may materially and adversely affect our business including by reducing demand for our wireless infrastructure and network services in addition a slowdown may increase competition for site rental customers and network services a wireless communications industry slowdown or a reduction in carrier network investment may materially and adversely affect our business 

a substantial portion of our revenues is derived from a small number of customers and the loss consolidation or financial instability of any of our limited number of customers may materially decrease revenues and reduce demand for our wireless infrastructure and network services 

for 2012  approximately 72  of our consolidated revenues were derived from sprint attverizon wireless and tmobile which represented 24  20  17  and 11  respectively of our consolidated net revenues the loss of any one of our large customers as a result of bankruptcy insolvency consolidation network sharing roaming joint development resale agreements by our customers merger with other customers of ours or otherwise may result in 1 a material decrease in our revenues 2 uncollectible account receivables 3 an impairment of our deferred site rental receivables wireless infrastructure assets site rental contracts and customer relationships intangible assets 4 inability to realize our deferred tax asset and 5 other adverse effects to our business we cannot guarantee that contracts with our major customers will not be terminated or that these customers will renew their contracts with us in addition to our four largest customers in the us we also derive a portion of our revenues and anticipated future growth from customers offering or contemplating offering emerging wireless services such customers are smaller and have less financial resources than our four largest customers have business models which may not be successful and may require additional capital see also item 1 business—the company 

consolidation among our customers will likely result in duplicate or overlapping parts of networks for example where they are coresidents on a tower which may result in a reduction of wireless infrastructure and impact revenues from our wireless infrastructure in addition consolidation may result in a reduction in such customers future capital expenditures in the aggregate because their expansion plans may be similar wireless carrier consolidation could decrease the demand for our wireless infrastructure which in turn may result in a reduction in our revenues and cash flows 

potential consolidations   in october 2012 tmobile entered into a definitive agreement to acquire metropcs subject to regulatory approval and other closing conditions during 2012  tmobile and metropcs accounted for 11 and 4 respectively of our consolidated net revenues as of december 31 2012  tmobile and metropcs are coresidents on approximately 1550 of our towers net revenues from metropcs on these 1550 towers represented approximately 2 of our consolidated net revenues during 2012  in december 2012  sprint entered into a definitive agreement to acquire the portion of clearwire it does not already own subject to regulatory approvals and other closing conditions during 2012  sprint and clearwire accounted for 24 and 3 respectively of our consolidated net revenues as of december 31 2012  sprint and clearwire are coresidents on approximately 2700 of our towers 

 if consummated in whole or in part these potential consolidations could result in decreased revenues and reduced or delayed demand for our wireless infrastructure as a result of the anticipated integration of these networks and consolidation of duplicate or overlapping parts of the networks we expect that any termination of customer contracts as a result of these potential acquisitions would be spread over multiple years as existing contracts expire 

recent consolidations  sprint merged with nextel in august 2005 resulting in the combined companys use of two separate wireless technologies during 2010 sprint announced network vision a multiyear network enhancement project to improve network speed quality and efficiency and consolidate their multiple network technologies including the elimination of their narrowband pushtotalk network referred to as iden sprint expects the network vision deployment to reach 250 million people by the end of 2013 while we do not expect that any of our customers network enhancement deployments and any related nonrenewal of customer contracts anticipated in 2014 and 2015 including sprints network vision and any corresponding nonrenewal iden leases to have a material adverse effect on our operations and cash flows for 2013 and subsequent periods there can be no assurances that additional or similar actions by our customers would not adversely affect our operations and cash flows in the future 

our substantial level of indebtedness could adversely affect our ability to react to changes in our business and the terms of our debt instruments limit our ability to take a number of actions that our management might otherwise believe to be in our best interests in addition if we fail to comply with our covenants our debt could be accelerated 

as a result of our substantial indebtedness 

 currently we have debt instruments in place that limit in certain circumstances our ability to incur indebtedness pay dividends create liens sell assets and engage in certain mergers and acquisitions among other things certain of our subsidiaries under their debt instruments are also required to maintain specific financial ratios our ability to comply with the financial ratio covenants under these instruments and to satisfy our debt obligations will depend on our future operating performance if we fail to comply with the debt restrictions we will be in default under those instruments which in some cases would cause the maturity of a substantial portion of our longterm indebtedness to be accelerated if our operating subsidiaries were to default on the debt the trustee could seek to foreclose the collateral securing such debt in which case we could lose the wireless infrastructure and the revenues associated with the wireless infrastructure we are currently in compliance with our debt service coverage and leverage ratios see item 7 mda—liquidity and capital resources—debt covenants  for a further discussion of our debt covenants 

ccic and ccoc are holding companies that conduct all of their operations through their subsidiaries accordingly ccics and ccocs respective sources of cash to pay interest and principal on their outstanding indebtedness are distributions relating to their respective ownership interests in their subsidiaries from the net earnings and cash flows generated by such subsidiaries or from proceeds of debt or equity offerings earnings and cash flows generated by their subsidiaries are first applied by such subsidiaries to conduct their operations including servicing their respective debt obligations after which any excess cash flows generally may be paid to such holding company in the absence of any special conditions such as a continuing event of default however their subsidiaries are legally distinct from the holding companies and unless they guarantee such debt have no obligation to pay amounts due on their debt or to make funds available to us for such payment 

we have a substantial amount of indebtedness in the event we do not repay or refinance such indebtedness we could face substantial liquidity issues and might be required to issue equity securities or securities convertible into equity securities or sell some of our assets to meet our debt payment obligations 

we have a substantial amount of indebtedness approximately 110 billion  as of december 31 2012  after giving effect to the january 2013 debt retirements which we will need to refinance or repay see item 7 mda—liquidity and capital resources  for a tabular presentation of our contractual debt maturities there can be no assurances we will be able to refinance our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or terms including with respect to interest rates as favorable as our current debt or at all 

economic conditions and the credit markets continue to experience a period of volatility uncertainty and weakness due to among other things the impact of uncertainty around european sovereign debt and us fiscal and monetary policies any renewed financial turmoil worsening credit environment weakening of the general economy and further uncertainty could impact the availability and cost of debt financing including with respect to any refinancing of the obligations described above and on our ability to draw the full amount of our 15 billion revolving credit facility that as of february 5 2013 has 2470 million  of undrawn availability 

if we are unable to refinance or renegotiate our debt we cannot guarantee that we will be able to generate enough cash flows from operations or that we will be able to obtain enough capital to service our debt or fund our planned capital expenditures in such an event we could face substantial liquidity issues and might be required to issue equity securities or securities convertible into equity securities or sell some of our assets to meet our debt payment obligations failure to refinance indebtedness when required could result in a default under such indebtedness assuming we meet certain financial ratios we have the ability under our debt instruments to incur additional indebtedness and any additional indebtedness we incur could exacerbate the risks described above 

sales or issuances of a substantial number of shares of our common stock may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

future sales or issuances of a substantial number of shares of our common stock or other equity related securities may adversely affect the market price of our common stock as of february 5 2013 we had 293158751 shares of common stock outstanding and we reserved 71 million shares of common stock for future issuance under our various stock compensation plans 

in addition a small number of stockholders own a significant percentage of our outstanding common stock if any one of these stockholders or any group of our stockholders sells a large quantity of shares of our common stock or the public market perceives that existing stockholders might sell a large quantity of shares of our common stock the market price of our common stock may significantly decline 

as a result of competition in our industry including from some competitors with significantly more resources or less debt than we have we may find it more difficult to achieve favorable rental rates on our new or renewing customer contracts 

our growth is dependent on entering into new customer contracts as well as renewing or renegotiating customer contracts when existing customer contracts terminate we face competition for site rental customers from various sources including 

 certain wireless carriers own and operate their own tower networks and certain of such carriers are larger and have greater financial resources than we have competition in our industry may make it more difficult for us to attract new customers maintain or increase our gross margins or maintain or increase our market share 

the business model for our small cell operations contains differences from our traditional site rental business resulting in different operational risks if we do not successfully operate that business model or identify and manage those operational risks such operations may produce results that are less than anticipated 

the business model for our small cell operations contains differences from our traditional tower operations including differences relating to customer contract terms landlord demographics ownership of certain network assets operational oversight requirements including requirements for service level agreements regarding network performance and maintenance applicable laws and initial gross margins although longterm gross margins are expected to be similar 

in addition our small cell operations have operational risks that are different from our traditional site rental business including the 1 use of clec status 2 use of public rightsofway 3 use of poles owned by third parties and 4 risks relating to overbuilding small cells also have risks similar to our tower operations such as there can be no assurances that new customers will colocate on our small cells or that either our existing small cell customers or our small cell landlords will renew their contracts at the same rate as our traditional site rental business in addition the rate at which wireless carriers adopt small cells may be lower or slower than we anticipate our small cell operations will also expose us to different safety or liability risks and hazards than our traditional site rental business as a result of numerous factors including the location and nature of the assets involved because small cells are comparatively new technologies and are continuing to evolve there may be other risks related to small cells of which we are not yet aware 

as a result of the nextg acquisition in april 2012 we have significantly increased the size and scope of our small cell operations which may exacerbate the impact of the risks described above in addition there can be no assurances that assets acquired in the nextg acquisition will perform as expected by us and provide us with the benefits anticipated if the nextg assets fail to perform as expected or if we fail to otherwise realize the anticipated benefits of the nextg acquisition our business financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected 

new technologies may significantly reduce demand for our wireless infrastructure and negatively impact our revenues 

improvements in the efficiency of wireless networks could reduce the demand for our wireless infrastructure for example signal combining technologies that permit one antenna to service multiple frequencies and thereby multiple customers may reduce the need for our wireless infrastructure in addition other technologies such as femtocells other small cells and satellite transmission systems such as low earth orbiting may in the future serve as substitutes for or alternatives to leasing that might otherwise be anticipated or expected on wireless infrastructure had such technologies not existed any significant reduction in wireless infrastructure leasing demand resulting from the previously mentioned technologies or other technologies may negatively impact our revenues or otherwise have a material adverse effect on us 

new wireless technologies may not deploy or be adopted by customers as rapidly or in the manner projected 

there can be no assurances that new wireless services and technologies will be introduced or deployed as rapidly or in the manner projected by the wireless or broadcast industries in addition demand and customer adoption rates for such new technologies may be lower or slower than anticipated for numerous reasons as a result growth opportunities and demand for our wireless infrastructure as a result of such technologies may not be realized at the times or to the extent anticipated 

if we fail to retain rights to our wireless infrastructure including the land interests under our towers our business may be adversely affected 

our property interests relating to the land interests on which our towers reside consist primarily of leasehold and subleasehold interests fee interests easements licenses and rightsofway a loss of these interests may interfere with our ability to conduct our business and generate revenues for various reasons we may not always have the ability to access analyze and verify all information regarding titles and other issues prior to purchasing wireless infrastructure further we may not be able to renew ground leases on commercially viable terms our ability to retain rights to the land interests on which our towers reside depends on our ability to purchase such land or to renegotiate and extend the terms of the leases relating to such land approximately 9  of our site rental gross margins for the year ended december 31 2012  are derived from towers where the leases for the land interests under such towers have final expiration dates of less than ten years if we are unable to retain rights to the land interests on which our towers reside our business may be adversely affected 

approximately 6500 of our towers are leased or operated for an initial period of 32 years through may 2037 under master leases and subleases with sprint we have the option to purchase in 2037 all but not less than all of the sprint towers from sprint for approximately 23 billion approximately 6200 of our towers are leased or subleased or operated and managed under a master prepaid lease and other related agreements with tmobile with a weightedaverage term of approximately 28  years weighted on site rental gross margin we have the option to purchase these towers from tmobile at the end of the respective lease or sublease terms for aggregate option payments of approximately 20 billion which payments if exercised would be between 2035 and 2049 approximately 470 of our towers are subject to a lease and sublease and other related arrangements with att we have the option to purchase these towers that we do not otherwise already own at the end of their respective lease terms for aggregate option payments of up to approximately 405 million which payments if exercised would be due between 2018 and 2032 less than 10 million would be due before 2025 we may not have the required available capital to exercise our right to purchase some or all of these towers at the time these options are required to be exercised even if we do have available capital we may choose not to exercise our right to purchase the sprint towers or some or all of the tmobile towers for business or other reasons in the event that we do not exercise these purchase rights or are otherwise unable to acquire an interest that would allow us to continue to operate these towers after the applicable period we will lose the cash flows derived from such towers which may have a material adverse effect on our business in the event that we decide to exercise these purchase rights the benefits of the acquisition of the applicable sprint towers or tmobile towers may not exceed the costs which could adversely affect our business 

under master lease and master prepaid lease arrangements we have with tmobile and sprint certain of our subsidiaries lease or sublease or are otherwise granted the right to manage and operate sites from bankruptcy remote subsidiaries of such carriers if one of these bankruptcy remote subsidiaries nevertheless becomes a debtor in a bankruptcy proceeding and is permitted to reject the underlying ground lease our subsidiaries could lose their interest in the applicable sites if our subsidiaries were to lose their interest in the applicable sites or if the applicable ground leases were to be terminated we would lose the cash flow derived from the towers on those sites which may have a material adverse effect on our business we have similar bankruptcy risks with respect to sites that we operate under management agreements 

our network services business has historically experienced significant volatility in demand which reduces the predictability of our results 

the operating results of our network services business for any particular period may vary significantly and should not necessarily be considered indicative of longerterm results for this activity our network services business may be adversely impacted by various factors including competition economic weakness and uncertainty our market share and changes in the type and volume of work performed 

the expansion and development of our business including through acquisitions increased product offerings and other strategic growth opportunities may cause disruptions in our business which may have an adverse effect on our business operations and financial results 

we seek to expand and develop our business including through acquisitions recent examples of which include the wcp acquisition the nextg acquisition and the tmobile acquisition increased product offerings and other strategic growth opportunities in the ordinary course of our business we review analyze and evaluate various potential transactions and other activities in which we may engage such transactions and activities could cause disruptions in increase risk or otherwise negatively impact our business among other things such transaction and activities may 

 for example the integration of the towers from the tmobile acquisition is a significant undertaking and requires significant resources as well as attention from our management team in addition the integration of these towers into our operations requires certain onetime costs for tasks such as tower visits and audits and ground and tenant lease verification if we fail to successfully and efficiently integrate the towers from the tmobile acquisition we may not realize the benefits we expect from the tmobile acquisition and our business financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected 

if we fail to comply with laws or regulations which regulate our business and which may change at any time we may be fined or even lose our right to conduct some of our business 

a variety of federal state local and foreign laws and regulations apply to our business including those discussed in item 1 business  failure to comply with applicable requirements may lead to civil penalties or require us to assume indemnification obligations or breach contractual provisions we cannot guarantee that existing or future laws or regulations including state and local tax laws will not adversely affect our business increase delays or result in additional costs these factors may have a material adverse effect on us 

if radio frequency emissions from wireless handsets or equipment on our wireless infrastructure are demonstrated to cause negative health effects potential future claims could adversely affect our operations costs and revenues 

the potential connection between radio frequency emissions and certain negative health effects including some forms of cancer has been the subject of substantial study by the scientific community in recent years we cannot guarantee that claims relating to radio frequency emissions will not arise in the future or that the results of such studies will not be adverse to us 

public perception of possible health risks associated with cellular and other wireless communications may slow or diminish the growth of wireless companies which may in turn slow or diminish our growth in particular negative public perception of and regulations regarding these perceived health risks may slow or diminish the market acceptance of wireless communications services if a connection between radio frequency emissions and possible negative health effects were established our operations costs and revenues may be materially and adversely affected we currently do not maintain any significant insurance with respect to these matters 

certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation bylaws and operative agreements and domestic and international competition laws may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us or for us to acquire control of a third party even if such a change in control would be beneficial to our stockholders 

we have a number of antitakeover devices in place that will hinder takeover attempts and may reduce the market value of our common stock our antitakeover provisions include 

 our bylaws permit special meetings of the stockholders to be called only upon the request of our chief executive officer or a majority of the board of directors and deny stockholders the ability to call such meetings such provisions as well as the provisions of section 203 of the delaware general corporation law may impede a merger consolidation takeover or other business combination or discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us 

in addition domestic and international competition laws may prevent or discourage us from acquiring wireless infrastructure in certain geographical areas or impede a merger consolidation takeover or other business combination or discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us 

we may be adversely effected by exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates relating to our operations in australia 

our australian operations expose us to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates for 2012  approximately 6  of our consolidated net revenues were denominated in australian dollars over the past five years the australian dollar has strengthened by 18  against the us dollar we have not historically engaged in significant hedging activities relating to our australian operations and we may suffer future losses as a result of changes in currency exchange rates

towers are vertical metal structures generally ranging in height from 50 to 500 feet in addition wireless communications equipment may also be placed on building rooftops and other structures our towers are located on tracts of land with an average size of approximately 20000 square feet these tracts of land support the towers equipment shelters and where applicable guyed wires to stabilize the structure our small cells are typically located in areas in which zoning restrictions or other barriers may prevent or delay the deployment of a tower and often are attached to public rightofway infrastructure including utility poles and street lights or are located at venues and universities our small cells are typically das which is a network of antennas for the benefit of wireless carriers and is connected by fiber to communication hubs designed to facilitate wireless communications 

see item 1 business—overview  for information regarding our wireless infrastructure portfolio including with respect to our land interests and for a discussion of the location of our towers in the us and australia including the percentage of our us towers in the top 50 and 100 btas see item 7 mda—liquidity and capital resources—contractual cash obligations  for a tabular presentation of the remaining terms to final expiration of the leases for the land interests which we do not own and on which our towers are located as of december 31 2012  

approximately 78 of our debt is secured approximately 8500 towers 27 of our total as well as nearly all of the third party land interests and other assets acquired in the wcp acquisition and their related cash flows effectively secure 40 billion  of our debt governing documents relating to another approximately 4900 towers prevent liens from being granted on those towers without approval of a subsidiary of verizon however distributions paid from the entities that own those towers also service our tower revenue notes in addition we have pledged the equity interests in certain subsidiaries in connection with our debt agreements see note 6  to our consolidated financial statements

substantially all of our wireless infrastructure can accommodate another tenant either as currently constructed or with appropriate modifications to the structure additionally if so inclined as a result of a customer request for a new colocation or amendment of an existing installation we could generally replace an existing tower with another tower in its place providing additional capacity subject to certain restrictions as of december 31 2012  the average number of tenants defined as a unique license and any related amendments thereto for count purposes per tower is approximately 24 on our towers the following is a summary of the number of existing tenants per tower as of december 31 2012  see item 7 mda—accounting and reporting matters—critical accounting policies and estimates  for a discussion of our impairment evaluation and our towers with no tenants

net revenues for 2012  increased by 3798 million  or 20  from 2011  this increase in net revenues resulted from an increase in site rental revenues of 2561 million  or 15  for the same periods this increase in site rental revenues was impacted by the following items inclusive of straightline accounting in no particular order new tenant additions across our entire portfolio renewals or extensions of customer contracts acquisitions escalations and cancellations of customer contracts see item 7 mda—accounting and reporting matters—critical accounting policies and estimates  for a further discussion of our revenue recognition policies tenant additions were influenced by the previously mentioned growth in the wireless communications industry see also item 1 business—the company—ccusa   

site rental gross margins for 2012  increased by 1993 million  or 15  from 2011  the increase in the site rental gross margins was related to the previously mentioned 15  increase in site rental revenues site rental gross margins for 2012  increased primarily as a result of 1 the high incremental margins associated with tenant additions given the relatively fixed costs to operate wireless infrastructure and 2 acquisitions the 1993 million  incremental margin represents 78  of the related increase in site rental revenues inclusive of impact of acquisitions 

network services and other revenues for 2012  increased by 1238 million  or 77  from 2011  and the related gross margin increased by 461 million  or 70  from 2011  the increase in our gross margin from our network services and other revenues is a reflection of the carrier network enhancements such as lte upgrades and the general volatility in the volume and mix of network services work our network services offering is of a variable nature as these revenues are not under longterm contracts 

general and administrative expenses for 2012  increased by 332 million  or 22  from 2011  but were 8  of net revenues for both 2012  and 2011  general and administrative expenses are inclusive of stockbased compensation charges which increased 57 million during 2012 primarily related to a nonrecurring stock grant see also note 12  to our consolidated financial statements the increase in general and administrative expenses in nominal dollars was commensurate with the growth in our business as a result of our acquisitions typically our general and administrative expenses do not significantly increase as a result of the colocation of additional tenants on our wireless infrastructure 

adjusted ebitda for 2012  increased by 2355 million  or 19  from 2011  adjusted ebitda was positively impacted by the growth in our site rental as well as the contributions from network services activities and acquisitions

the benefit provision for income taxes for 2012 was a benefit of 601 million inclusive of a valuation allowance reversal of 1152 million resulting from 1 the nextg acquisition and 2 our determination to reverse a portion of the valuation allowance based upon our consideration of our recent historical trends and anticipated future taxable income for 2012 and 2011 the effective tax rate differs from the federal statutory rate predominately due to our federal deferred tax valuation allowance and the net impact of state taxes see item 7 mda—accounting and reporting matters—critical accounting policies and estimates   and note 9  in our consolidated financial statements 

net income loss attributable to ccic stockholders for 2012  was income of 1446 million  compared to income of 1681 million  for 2011 the decrease in net income was predominately due to the increase in interest expense and the net losses on the retirement of debt partially offset by 1 the growth in our existing business and 2 a change in our benefit provision for income taxes primarily as a result of the reversal of the us federal and state deferred tax valuation allowances 

ccal— 2012  and 2011   the increases and decreases between 2012  and 2011  were inclusive of exchange rate fluctuations the average exchange rate of australian dollars expressed in us dollars for 2012  was approximately 104  an increase of approximately 1  from approximately 103  for the same period in the prior year see item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

depreciation amortization and accretion for 2011  increased by 92 million  or 2 from 2010  the increase is consistent with the insignificant movement in our fixed assets and intangible assets which did not materially change between 2011 and 2010 

during 2010 we repaid or purchased 34 billion of face value of debt using cash from our issuances of debt in order to extend the maturities of our debt portfolio as a result of purchasing and early retiring certain of our debt we incurred a net loss of 1384 million for 2010 inclusive of make whole payments during 2010 we realized losses on interest rate swaps of 2864 million which predominately resulted from an increase in the liability for those swaps not subject to hedge accounting due to changes in the libor yield curve all of our forwardstarting swaps were settled during 2010 so no further cash outflows associated with these swaps will occur the increase in interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs of 184 million or 4 in 2011 resulted predominately from a 175 million increase in the amortization of interest rate swaps primarily related to the loss realized in 2010 on the swaps hedging the refinancing of the 2006 tower revenue notes for a further discussion of the debt refinancings and the interest rate swaps see notes 6  and 7  to our consolidated financial statements 

benefit provision for income taxes for 2011  was a provision of 61 million  compared to a benefit of 288 million  for 2010  for 2011 and 2010 the effective tax rate differs from the statutory rate predominately due to our federal deferred valuation allowances in addition 2010 included 198 million of federal tax benefits recorded predominately as a result of discrete events including acquisitions

liquidity and capital resources 

overview 

general  we believe our core business can be characterized as a stable cash flow stream generated by revenues under longterm contracts see item 7 mda—general overview—overview  since we became a public company in 1998 our cumulative net cash provided by operating activities net of cash interest payments has exceeded our capital expenditures and provided us with cash available for discretionary investments for the foreseeable future we expect to continue to generate net cash provided by operating activities that exceeds our capital expenditures and will be available for discretionary investments in addition to investing net cash provided by operating activities in certain circumstances we may also use debt financings and issuances of equity or equity related securities to fund discretionary investments 

we seek to allocate the net cash provided by our operating activities in a manner that will enhance per share results our historical discretionary investments include in no particular order purchasing our common stock acquiring or constructing wireless infrastructure acquiring land interests under towers improving and structurally enhancing our existing wireless infrastructure and purchasing repaying or redeeming our debt 

we seek to maintain a capital structure that we believe drives longterm stockholder value and optimizes our weightedaverage cost of capital we target a leverage ratio of approximately four to six times adjusted ebitda and interest coverage of approximately three times adjusted ebitda subject to various factors such as the availability and cost of capital and the potential longterm return on our discretionary investments we may choose to increase or decrease our leverage and coverage from these targets for various periods of time see our discussion of the impact of the tmobile acquisition on our leverage in item 7 mda—general overview—overview 

we have never declared or paid cash dividends on our common stock currently we endeavor to utilize our net cash provided by operating activities to engage in discretionary investments we seek to maintain flexibility in our discretionary investments with both net cash provided by operating activities and cash available from financing capacity periodically our board of directors assesses the advisability of declaring and paying cash dividends at some point in the future based on the thencurrent and anticipated future conditions including our earnings net cash provided by operating activities capital requirements financial condition our relative market capitalization taxable income taxpayer status and other factors deemed relevant by the board of directors 

we pay minimal cash income taxes as a result of our net operating loss carryforwards we have 27 billion  of federal net operating losses to offset future taxable income we expect to utilize our federal net operating losses between now and 2017 based on current taxable income projections we evaluate our options with respect to appropriately managing our tax position on an ongoing basis these options may include a conversion to a real estate investment trust reit which would require the payment of dividends on our common stock if we were to convert to a reit we expect that certain subsidiaries would not qualify as a reit and would continue to be subject to corporate income taxes 

liquidity position  the following is a summary of our capitalization and liquidity position as of december 31 2012 after giving effect to the january 2013 debt retirements see item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  and notes 6  and 20  to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our debt

 summary cash flows information   



operating activities 

the increase in net cash provided by operating activities for 2012  from 2011  and 2010  was due primarily to growth in our core site rental business inclusive of our acquisitions changes in working capital and particularly changes in accounts receivable deferred site rental receivables deferred rental revenues prepaid ground leases restricted cash and accrued interest can have a significant impact on net cash provided by operating activities largely due to the timing of prepayments and receipts we expect net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december 31 2013  will be sufficient to cover the next 12 months of our expected debt service obligations and capital expenditures we expect to grow our net cash provided by operating activities in the future exclusive of movements in working capital if we realize expected growth in our site rental business 

investing activities 

capital expenditures  we categorize our capital expenditures as sustaining or discretionary sustaining capital expenditures include capitalized costs related to 1 maintenance activities on our wireless infrastructure which are generally related to replacements and upgrades that extend the life of the asset 2 vehicles 3 information technology equipment and 4 office equipment discretionary capital expenditures which we also commonly refer to as revenuegenerating capital expenditures include 1 purchases of land interests under towers 2 wireless infrastructure improvements and structural enhancements in order to support additional site rentals and 3 the construction of wireless infrastructure 

a summary of our capital expenditures for the last three years is as follows   



other than sustaining capital expenditures which we expect to be approximately 28 million to 32 million for the year ended december 31 2013  our capital expenditures are discretionary and are made with respect to activities which we believe exhibit sufficient potential to improve our longterm results on a per share basis we expect to use roughly 400 million to 450 million of our cash flows on capital expenditures sustaining and discretionary for full year 2013  with approximately onefourth of our total capital expenditures targeted for our existing wireless infrastructure assets related to customer installations and related capacity improvement our decisions regarding capital expenditures are influenced by the availability and cost of capital and expected returns on alternative investments the following is a discussion of certain aspects of our capital expenditures 

 acquisitions acquisitions consist of the acquisitions of businesses such as towers das and third party land sites see notes 3  and 5  for a discussion of the wcp acquisition the nextg acquisition and the tmobile acquisition in 2012 and our acquisition of newpath in 2010

our debt obligations contain certain financial covenants with which ccic or our subsidiaries must maintain compliance in order to avoid the imposition of certain restrictions various of our debt obligations also place other restrictions on ccic or our subsidiaries which may include the ability to incur debt and liens purchase our securities make capital expenditures dispose of assets undertake transactions with affiliates make other investments and pay dividends we are permitted to issue additional indebtedness at ccic and at our operating subsidiaries subject to compliance with the covenants governing our debt including the below mentioned restrictive covenants and meeting certain other requirements which may include obtaining rating agency confirmations see note 6  to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our debt covenants 

factors that are likely to determine our subsidiaries ability to comply with their current and future debt covenants include their 1 financial performance 2 levels of indebtedness and 3 debt service requirements given the current level of indebtedness and debt services requirements of our subsidiaries the primary risk of a debt covenant violation would be from a deterioration of a subsidiarys financial performance should a covenant violation occur in the future as a result of a shortfall in financial performance or for any other reason we might be required to make principal payments earlier than currently scheduled and may not have access to additional borrowings under these debt instruments as long as the covenant violation continues if we fail to comply with the debt restrictions we will be in default under those instruments which could cause the maturity of a substantial portion of our longterm indebtedness to be accelerated if our operating subsidiaries were to default on the debt the trustee could seek to pursue the collateral securing the debt in which case we could lose the wireless infrastructure and the future revenues associated with such wireless infrastructure we currently have no financial covenant violations and based upon our current expectations we believe our operating results will be sufficient to comply with our debt covenants over the near and longterm see item 1a risk factors

accounting and reporting matters 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the following is a discussion of the accounting policies and estimates that we believe 1 are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and 2 require our most difficult subjective or complex judgments often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain the critical accounting policies and estimates for 2012  are not intended to be a comprehensive list of our accounting policies and estimates see note 2  to our consolidated financial statements for a summary of our significant accounting policies in many cases the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by gaap with no need for managements judgment in other cases management is required to exercise judgment in the application of accounting principles with respect to particular transactions 

revenue recognition  over 87  of our total revenue for 2012  consists of site rental revenues which are recognized on a monthly basis over the fixed noncancelable term of the relevant contract generally ranging from five to 15 years regardless of whether the payments from the customer are received in equal monthly amounts if the payment terms call for fixed escalations as in fixed dollar or fixed percentage increases prepaid rent or rent free periods the revenue is recognized on a straightline basis over the fixed noncancelable term of the contract when calculating our straightline rental revenues we consider all fixed elements of tenant contractual escalation provisions even if such escalation provisions contain a variable element such as an escalator tied to an inflationbased index in addition to a minimum any upfront billings to customers for their negotiated share of the cost of wireless infrastructure modifications required to accommodate the installation of customer equipment or the cost of the construction of small cells are initially deferred and recognized over the term of the applicable site rental contract to the extent we acquire belowmarket tenant leases for contractual interests with tenants on the acquired wireless infrastructure for example with respect to small cells we record deferred credits and amortize such deferred credits to site rental revenues over their estimated lease term since we recognize revenue on a straightline basis a portion of the site rental revenue in a given period represents cash collected or contractually collectible in other periods we record a deferred site rental receivable for the difference between the straightlined amount and the rent billed we record an allowance for uncollectible deferred site rental revenues for which increases or reversals of this allowance impact our site rental revenues see note 2  to our consolidated financial statements 

we provide network services relating to our wireless infrastructure which represent less than 13  of our total revenues for 2012  network services and other revenue relate to installation services as well as the following additional site development services relating to existing and new antenna installations on our wireless infrastructure site acquisition architectural and engineering zoning and permitting fiber installations other construction and other services related to network development network services revenues are recognized after completion of the applicable service we account for network services separately from the customers site rental 

see item 1 business—ccusa  for a further discussion of our business 

accounting for acquisitions — general as described in  item 1 business  much of our wireless infrastructure has been acquired in various transactions from the four largest wireless carriers or their predecessors through transactions consummated since 1999 we evaluate each of our acquisitions to determine if it should be accounted for as a business combination or as an acquisition of assets for our business combinations we allocate the purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair value at the date of acquisition any purchase price in excess of the net fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is allocated to goodwill see accounting for acquisitions  valuation below 

the determination of the final purchase price allocation could extend over several quarters resulting in the use of preliminary estimates that are subject to adjustment until finalized such changes could have a significant impact on our financial statements and could result in retrospective changes in results reported for the acquired business in prior periods in accordance with gaap as of december 31 2012  the purchase price allocation for the tmobile acquisition is preliminary and subject to change including as result of the finalization of the valuation of certain tangible and intangible assets and certain liabilities 

accounting for acquisitions — valuation  as of december 31 2012  our largest asset was property and equipment which primarily consists of wireless infrastructure followed by intangible assets and goodwill approximately 29 billion  and 31 billion  in net book value respectively approximately 27 billion  net book value at december 31 2012  of our identifiable intangibles relate to the site rental contracts and customer relationships intangible assets see note 2  to our consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the nature and composition of the site rental contracts and customer relationships intangible assets 

 the fair value of the vast majority of our assets and liabilities is determined by using either 

 the purchase price allocation requires subjective estimates that if incorrectly estimated could be material to our consolidated financial statements including the amount of depreciation amortization and accretion expense the most important estimates for measurement of tangible fixed assets are 1 the cost to replace the asset with a new asset and 2 the economic useful life after giving effect to age quality and condition the most important estimates for measurement of intangible assets are 1 discount rates and 2 timing and amount of cash flows including estimates regarding customer renewals and cancellations the most important estimates for measurement of above and belowmarket leases is the determination of 1 favorablility or unfavorability to the current market terms and 2 applicable lease term including whether renewals or extensions should be measured with respect to business combinations that include towers that we lease and operate such as the tmobile towers and the sprint towers we evaluate such agreements to determine treatment as capital or operating leases and identification of any bargain purchase options 

we record the fair value of obligations to perform certain asset retirement activities including requirements pursuant to our ground leases and easements to remove wireless infrastructure or remediate the land upon which our wireless infrastructure resides in determining the fair value of these asset retirement obligations we must make several subjective and highly judgmental estimates such as those related to 1 timing of cash flows 2 future costs 3 discount rates and 4 the probability of enforcement to remove the wireless infrastructure or remediate the land see note 2  to our consolidated financial statements 

accounting for longlived assets — useful lives  we are required to make subjective assessments as to the useful lives of our tangible and intangible assets for purposes of determining depreciation amortization and accretion expense that if incorrectly estimated could be material to our consolidated financial statements depreciation expense for our property and equipment is computed using the straightline method over the estimated useful lives of our various classes of tangible assets the substantial portion of our property and equipment represents the cost of our wireless infrastructure which is depreciated with an estimated useful life equal to the shorter of 1 20 years or 2 the term of the lease including optional renewals for the land interests under the wireless infrastructure 

the useful life of our intangible assets are estimated based on the period over which the intangible asset is expected to benefit us and gives consideration to the expected useful life of other assets to which the useful life may relate amortization expense for intangible assets is computed using the straightline method over the estimated useful life of each of the intangible assets the useful life of the site rental contracts and customer relationships intangible assets is limited by the maximum depreciable life of the wireless infrastructure 20 years as a result of the interdependency of the wireless infrastructure and site rental contracts and customer relationships in contrast the site rental contracts and customer relationships are estimated to provide economic benefits for several decades because of the low rate of customer cancellations and high rate of renewals experienced to date thus while site rental contracts and customer relationships are valued based upon the fair value of the site rental contracts and customer relationships which includes assumptions regarding both 1 customers exercise of optional renewals contained in the acquired contracts and 2 renewals of the acquired contracts past the contractual term including exercisable options the site rental contracts are amortized over a period not to exceed 20 years as a result of the useful life being limited by the depreciable life of the wireless infrastructure 

accounting for longlived assets — impairment evaluation — intangibles  we review the carrying values of property and equipment intangible assets and other longlived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable we utilize the following dual grouping policy for purposes of determining the unit of account for testing impairment of the site rental contracts and customer relationships 

 we first pool site rental contracts and customer relationships intangible assets and property and equipment into portfolio groups for purposes of determining the unit of account for impairment testing because we view wireless infrastructure as portfolios and wireless infrastructure in a given portfolio and its related customer contracts are not largely independent of the other wireless infrastructure in the portfolio we reevaluate the appropriateness of the pooled groups at least annually this use of grouping is based in part on 1 our limitations regarding disposal of wireless infrastructure 2 the interdependencies of wireless infrastructure portfolios and 3 the manner in which wireless infrastructure is traded in the marketplace the vast majority of our site rental 

contracts and customer relationships intangible assets and property and equipment are pooled into the us owned wireless infrastructure group secondly and separately we pool site rental contracts and customer relationships by significant customer or by customer grouping for individually insignificant customers as appropriate for purposes of determining the unit of account for impairment testing because we associate the value ascribed to site rental contracts and customer relationships intangible assets to the underlying contracts and related customer relationships acquired 

our determination that an adverse event or change in circumstance has occurred that indicates that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable will generally involve 1 a deterioration in an assets financial performance compared to historical results 2 a shortfall in an assets financial performance compared to forecasted results or 3 changes affecting the utility and estimated future demands for the asset when considering the utility of our assets we consider events that would meaningfully impact 1 our wireless infrastructure or 2 our customer relationships for example consideration would be given to events that impact 1 the structural integrity and longevity of our wireless infrastructure or 2 our ability to derive benefit from our existing customer relationships including events such as bankruptcy or insolvency or loss of a significant customer during 2012  there were no events or circumstances that caused us to review the carrying value of our intangible assets and property and equipment due in part to our assets performing consistently with or better than our expectations 

if the sum of the estimated future cash flows undiscounted from an asset or portfolio group significant customer or customer group for individually insignificant customers as applicable is less than its carrying amount an impairment loss may be recognized if the carrying value were to exceed the undiscounted cash flows measurement of an impairment loss would be based on the fair value of the asset which is based on an estimate of discounted future cash flows the most important estimates for such calculations of undiscounted cash flows are 1 the expected additions of new tenants and equipment on our wireless infrastructure and 2 estimates regarding customer cancellations and renewals of contracts we could record impairments in the future if changes in longterm market conditions expected future operating results or the utility of the assets results in changes for our impairment test calculations which negatively impact the fair value of our property and equipment and intangible assets or if we changed our unit of account in the future 

when grouping assets into pools for purposes of impairment evaluation we also consider individual towers nodes and third party land interests within a grouping for which we currently have no tenants approximately 3  of our total towers currently have no tenants we continue to pay operating expenses on these towers in anticipation of obtaining tenants on these towers in the future primarily because of the individual tower site demographics we estimate based on current visibility potential tenants on over half of these towers to the extent we do not believe there are longterm prospects of obtaining tenants on an individual tower node or third party land interest and all other possible avenues for recovering the carrying value has been exhausted including sale of the asset we appropriately reduce the carrying value of such assets to fair value 

accounting for longlived assets — impairment evaluation — goodwill   nearly all of our goodwill is recorded at ccusa we test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis regardless of whether adverse events or changes in circumstances have occurred the annual test begins with goodwill and all intangible assets being allocated to applicable reporting units we then perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount if it is concluded that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount it is necessary to perform the twostep goodwill impairment test otherwise the twostep goodwill impairment test is not required our reporting units are the operating segments ccusa and ccal since segment management operates their respective wireless infrastructure portfolios as a single network 

we performed our most recent annual goodwill impairment test as of october 1 2012 which resulted in no impairments this assessment included consideration of our market capitalization which exceeded over seven times the aggregate carrying amount of the reporting units as of december 31 2012  

deferred income taxes  we record deferred income tax assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet related to events that impact our financial statements and tax returns in different periods in order to compute these deferred tax balances we first analyze the differences between the book basis and tax basis of our assets and liabilities referred to as temporary differences these temporary differences are then multiplied by current tax rates to arrive at the balances for the deferred income tax assets and liabilities a valuation allowance is provided on deferred tax assets that do not meet the more likely than not realization threshold we recognize a tax position if it is more likely than not it will be sustained upon examination the tax position is measured at the largest amount that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 

 if our expectations about the future tax consequences of past events should prove to be inaccurate the balances of our deferred income tax assets and liabilities could require significant adjustments in future periods our ability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards is dependent in part upon our having sufficient future earnings to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards before they expire if market conditions change materially and we determine that we will be unable to generate 

sufficient taxable income in the future to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards we would be required to record an additional valuation allowance which would reduce our earnings such adjustments could cause a material effect on our results of operations for the period of the adjustment the change in our valuation allowance has no effect on our cash flows 

  see item 7 mda—results of operations—comparison of operating segments for a discussion of our benefit provision for income taxes during 2012 2011 and 2010 during 2012 we reversed the valuation allowance at ccusa and ccal related to our determination that we are more likely than not to realize these deferred tax assets as a result of our recent historical trends of taxable income and anticipated future taxable income for the respective jurisdictions the evaluation of the amount of our valuation allowance and the timing of any such adjustments requires significant judgment see note 9  of our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our valuation allowance

nongaap financial measures 

our measurement of profit or loss currently used to evaluate the operating performance of our operating segments is earnings before interest taxes depreciation amortization and accretion as adjusted or adjusted ebitda our definition of adjusted ebitda is set forth in item 7 mda—results of operations—comparison of operating segments    our measure of adjusted ebitda may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies including companies in the tower sector and other similar providers of wireless infrastructure and is not a measure of performance calculated in accordance with gaap adjusted ebitda should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for operating income or loss net income or loss net cash provided by used for operating investing and financing activities or other income statement or cash flow statement data prepared in accordance with gaap 

we believe adjusted ebitda is useful to an investor in evaluating our operating performance because 

 our management uses adjusted ebitda 

 34 

there are material limitations to using a measure such as adjusted ebitda including the difficulty associated with comparing results among more than one company including our competitors and the inability to analyze certain significant items including depreciation and interest expense that directly affect our net income or loss management compensates for these limitations by considering the economic effect of the excluded expense items independently as well as in connection with their analysis of net income loss 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

our primary exposures to market risks are related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates which may adversely affect our results of operations and financial position we seek to manage exposure to changes in interest rates where economically prudent to do so by utilizing fixed rate debt we do not currently hedge against foreign currency exchange risks 

interest rate risk 

our interest rate risk relates primarily to the impact of interest rate movements on the following 

 potential refinancing of existing debt 

over the next 12 months we have no debt maturities other than principal payments on amortizing debt we do not anticipate the need to access the capital markets to refinance our existing debt until at least 2015 which reflects the impact of refinancings that extended our debt maturities as of december 31 2012  we have no interest rate swaps hedging any refinancings see item 7 mda—liquidity and capital resources—overview   

floating rate debt 

we manage our exposure to market interest rates on our existing debt by controlling the mix of fixed and floating rate debt as of december 31 2012  we had 33 billion  of floating rate debt which included 16 billion of debt with a libor floor of 1 per annum as a result a hypothetical unfavorable fluctuation in market interest rates on our existing debt of 18 of a percent point over a 12 month period would increase our interest expense by approximately 2 million when giving effect to our libor floor and would increase our interest expense by approximately 4 million exclusive of the impact of the libor floor 

potential future borrowings of incremental debt 

we typically do not hedge our exposure to interest rates on potential future borrowings of incremental debt for a substantial period prior to issuance see item 7 mda—liquidity and capital resources  regarding our shortterm liquidity strategy 

the following table provides information about our market risk related to changes in interest rates the future principal payments and weightedaverage interest rates are presented as of december 31 2012  after giving effect to the january 2013 debt retirements these debt maturities reflect contractual maturity dates and do not consider the impact of the principal payments that will commence following the anticipated repayment dates of certain notes see footnote c see note 6  to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our debt 



   

 

foreign currency risk 

the vast majority of our foreign currency risk is related to the australian dollar which is the functional currency of ccal ccal represented 6  of our consolidated revenues and 4  of our consolidated operating income for 2012  as of december 31 2012  the australian dollar exchange rate had strengthened compared to the us dollar by approximately 1 from the average rate for 2011  see item 7 mda—results of operations—comparison of operating segments 

foreign exchange markets have recently been volatile and we expect foreign exchange markets to continue to be volatile over the near term we believe the risk related to our financial instruments exclusive of intercompany financing deemed a longterm investment denominated in australian dollars is not significant to our financial condition a hypothetical increase or decrease of 25 in australian dollar exchange rate would increase or decrease the fair value of our financial instruments by approximately 12 million

overview 

we own operate and lease shared wireless infrastructure including 1 towers and other structures such as rooftops collectively towers 2 distributed antenna systems daseach such system is a network of antennas for the benefit of wireless carriers and is connected by fiber to communication hubs designed to facilitate wireless communications and 3 interests in land under third party towers in various forms third party land interests unless the context otherwise suggests or requires references herein to wireless infrastructure include towers das and third party land interests our core business is renting space or physical capacity collectively space on our towers das and to a lesser extent third party land interests collectively site rental business via longterm contracts in various forms including license sublease and lease agreements collectively contracts our wireless infrastructure can accommodate multiple customers colocation for antennas and other equipment necessary for the transmission of signals for wireless communication devices we seek to increase our site rental revenues by adding more tenants on our wireless infrastructure which we expect to result in significant incremental cash flows due to our relatively fixed operating costs 

information concerning our site rental business as of december 31 2011  is as follows 

 information concerning our customers and site rental contracts as of december 31 2011  is as follows 

 to a lesser extent we also provide certain network services relating to our wireless infrastructure primarily consisting of antenna installations and subsequent augmentations as well as additional site development services relating to existing and new antenna installations on our wireless infrastructure 

strategy 

our strategy is to increase longterm stockholder value by translating anticipated future growth in our core site rental business into growth of our results of operations on a per share basis we believe our strategy is consistent with our mission to deliver the highest level of service to our customers at all times – striving to be their critical partner as we assist them in growing efficient ubiquitous wireless networks the key elements of our strategy are to 

 our longterm strategy is based on our belief that additional demand for our wireless infrastructure will be created by the expected continued growth in the wireless communications industry which is predominately driven by the demand for wireless voice and data services by consumers we believe that additional demand for wireless infrastructure will create future growth opportunities for us we believe that such demand for our wireless infrastructure will continue will result in organic growth of our revenues due to new tenant additions on our existing wireless infrastructure and will create other growth opportunities for us such as demand for new wireless infrastructure 

during 2011 consumer demand for wireless data services continued to grow as consumer demand for wireless devices such as smartphones tablets and laptops increased the growth rate of voice services slowed this growth in wireless data services is driven by increased mobile video internet usage and machinetomachine applications the following is a discussion of certain recent events and actual and expected growth trends in the us wireless communications industry 

 

   

 2011  highlights and recent developments 

see item 7 mda  and our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of developments and activities occurring in 2011  in addition see item 7 mda  and note 20 of our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of subsequent events occurring in 2012 through the date of this filing including the definitive agreement to acquire nextg the wcp acquisition the refinancing of our credit facility in january 2012 january 2012 refinancing and the exercise of our mandatory conversion right on our 625 redeemable convertible preferred stock preferred stock conversion 

the company 

virtually all of our operations are located in the us and australia we conduct our operations principally through subsidiaries of crown castle operating company ccoc including 1 certain subsidiaries which operate our wireless infrastructure portfolios in the us and 2 a 776 owned subsidiary that operates our australia tower portfolio for more information about our operating segments as well as financial information about the geographic areas in which we operate see note 16  to our consolidated financial statements and item 7 mda   

ccusa 

site rental  the core business of ccusa is the renting of space on our wireless infrastructure we predominately rent space to wireless carriers under longterm contracts for their antennas which transmit a variety of signals related to wireless voice and data as a result we believe our wireless infrastructure is integral to our customers network and their ability to serve their customers 

most of our towers were acquired from the four largest wireless carriers or their predecessors through transactions consummated since 1999 including 1 approximately 10700 towers from global signal inc global signal in 2007 of which approximately 6600 were originally acquired from sprint 2 approximately 4800 towers during 1999 to 2000 from companies now part of verizon wireless 3 approximately 2700 towers during 1999 to 2000 from companies now part of att as well as 4 other smaller acquisitions from companies now part of tmobile and other independent tower operators 

we generally receive monthly rental payments from tenants payable under longterm contracts we have existing master lease agreements with most wireless carriers including verizon wireless att sprint and tmobile such agreements provide certain terms including economic terms that govern contracts on our towers entered into by such carriers during the term of their master lease agreements over the last several years we have negotiated up to 15year terms for both initial and renewal periods for certain of our customers which often included fixed escalations we continue to endeavor to negotiate with our existing customer base for longer contractual terms which often may contain fixed escalation rates 

our customer contracts have a high renewal rate because of 1 the integral nature of our wireless infrastructure within our customers networks 2 customers cost associated with relocation of their antennas and other equipment to another wireless infrastructure and 3 zoning and other barriers including the cost of capital associated with the construction of new wireless infrastructure with limited exceptions the customer contracts may not be terminated prior to the end of their current term in general each customer contract which is renewable will automatically renew at the end of its term unless the customer provides prior notice of its intent not to renew see note 15  to our consolidated financial statements for a tabular presentation of the minimum rental cash payments due to us by tenants pursuant to contract agreements without consideration of tenant renewal options 

the average monthly rental payment of a new tenant added to wireless infrastructure varies based on 1 the different regions in the us 2 aggregate customer volume and 3 the type of signal transmitted by the tenant primarily as a result of the physical size of the antenna installation and related equipment in addition with respect to das the amount of the rental payment can also be influenced by the cost of installation including the related fiber we also routinely receive rental payment increases in connection with contract amendments pursuant to which our customers add additional antennas or other equipment to wireless infrastructure on which they already have equipment pursuant to preexisting contract agreements 

approximately twothirds of our direct site operating expenses consist of ground lease expenses and the remainder includes property taxes repairs and maintenance employee compensation and related benefit costs and utilities our cash operating 

expenses tend to escalate at approximately the rate of inflation partially offset by reductions in cash ground lease expenses from our purchases of land interests as a result of the relatively fixed nature of these expenditures the colocation of additional tenants is achieved at a low incremental operating cost resulting in high incremental operating cash flows our wireless infrastructure portfolio requires minimal sustaining capital expenditures including maintenance and other nondiscretionary capital expenditures and are typically less than 2 of site rental revenues or an annual average over the last three years of approximately 25 million see note 15  to our consolidated financial statements for a tabular presentation of the rental cash payments owed by us to landlords pursuant to our contractual agreements 

network services  to a lesser extent we also offer wireless communication companies and their agents certain network services relating to our wireless infrastructure for 2011 69 of network services and other revenues related to antenna installations and subsequent augmentation collectively installation services and the remainder related to the following additional site development services relating to existing and new antenna installations on our wireless infrastructure site acquisition architectural and engineering zoning and permitting fiber installations other construction and other services related to network development we do not always provide the installation services on our wireless infrastructure as the customer may obtain a third party to complete these services see also  —competition  below we have grown our network services business over the last several years as a result of our focus on customer service increasing our market share for installation services on our wireless infrastructure promoting site development services and expanding the scope of services we have the capability and expertise to install with the assistance of our network of subcontractors equipment and antenna systems for our customers these activities are typically nonrecurring and highly competitive with a number of local competitors in most markets nearly all of our antenna installation services are billed on a costplus profit basis 

customers  we work extensively with large national wireless carriers and in general our customers are primarily comprised of providers of wireless voice and data services who operate national or regional networks the following table summarizes the net revenues from our four largest customers expressed as a percentage of our consolidated revenues for 2011  see item 1a risk factors 



sales and marketing  our sales organization markets our wireless infrastructure within the wireless communications industry with the objectives of renting space on existing wireless infrastructure and on new wireless infrastructure prior to construction as well as obtaining network services related to our wireless infrastructure we seek to become the critical partner and preferred independent wireless infrastructure provider for our customers and increase customer satisfaction relative to our peers by leveraging our 1 technological tools 2 process centric approach and 3 customer relationships 

we use public and proprietary databases to develop targeted marketing programs focused on carrier network expansions including das and related network services we attempt to match specific wireless infrastructure in our portfolio with potential new site demand by obtaining and analyzing information including our customers existing antenna locations tenant contracts marketing strategies capital spend plans deployment status and actual wireless carrier signal strength measurements taken in the field we have developed a webbased tool that stores key wireless infrastructure information above and beyond normal property management information including data on actual customer signal strength demographics site readiness and competitive structures in addition the webbased tool assists us in estimating potential demand for our wireless infrastructure with greater speed and accuracy we believe these and other tools we have developed assist our customers in their site selection and deployment of their wireless networks and provide us with an opportunity to have proactive discussions with them regarding their wireless infrastructure deployment plans and the timing and location of their demand for our wireless infrastructure a key aspect to our sales and marketing strategy is a continued emphasis on our processcentric approach to reduce cycle time related to new leasing and amendments which helps provide our customers with faster deployment of their networks 

a team of national account directors maintains our relationships with our largest customers these directors work to develop wireless infrastructure leasing and network service opportunities as well as to ensure that customers wireless infrastructure needs are efficiently translated into new leases on our wireless infrastructure sales personnel in our area offices develop and maintain local relationships with our customers that are expanding their networks entering new markets bringing new technologies to market or requiring maintenance or addon business in addition to our fulltime sales and marketing staff a number of senior managers and officers spend a significant portion of their time on sales and marketing activities and call on existing and prospective 

customers 

competition  we compete with 1 other independent tower owners which also provide site rental and network services 2 wireless carriers which build own and operate their own tower networks and lease space to other wireless communication companies and 3 owners of alternative facilities including rooftops water towers broadcast towers das and utility poles some of the larger independent tower companies with which we compete in the us include american tower corporation and sba communications corporation wireless carriers that own and operate their own tower networks generally some of which are larger and have greater financial resources than we have we believe that tower location and capacity deployment speed quality of service and price have been and will continue to be the most significant competitive factors affecting the leasing of wireless infrastructure 

competitors in the network services business include site acquisition consultants zoning consultants real estate firms rightofway consulting firms construction companies tower owners and managers radio frequency engineering consultants telecommunications equipment vendors who can provide turnkey site development services through multiple subcontractors and our customers internal staffs we believe that our customers base their decisions on the outsourcing of network services on criteria such as a companys experience track record local reputation price and time for completion of a project

our primary business in australia is the renting of antenna space on towers to our customers ccal is owned 776 by us and 224 by permanent nominees aust ltd acting on behalf of a group of professional and private investors led by todd capital limited ccal is the largest independent tower operator in australia as of december 31 2011  ccal had approximately 1600  towers with 58 of such towers located in seven major metropolitan areas the majority of ccals towers were acquired from optus in 2000 and vodafone in 2001 ccal also provides a range of services including site maintenance and property management services for towers owned by third parties 

for 2011  ccal comprised 6  of our consolidated net revenues ccals principal customers are telstra optus and vha which collectively accounted for approximately 94 of ccals 2011 revenues during 2011 the australian government entered into agreements with carriers to develop and roll out the national broadband network nbn nbn is a national highspeed openaccess data network under development targeting nearly all australian premises we believe that the development of nbn may result in additional future demand for new tenant additions on ccals existing towers and construction of new towers 

in australia ccal competes with wireless carriers which own and operate their own tower networks service companies that provide site maintenance and property management services and other site owners such as broadcasters and building owners the other significant tower owners in australia are broadcast australia an independent operator of broadcast towers and telstra and optus wireless carriers we believe that tower location capacity quality of service deployment speed and price within a geographic market are the most significant competitive factors affecting the leasing of wireless infrastructure in australia 

employees 

at january 31 2012 we employed approximately 1300 people worldwide including approximately 1200 in the us we are not a party to any collective bargaining agreements we have not experienced any strikes or work stoppages and management believes that our employee relations are satisfactory 

regulatory and environmental matters 

to date we have not incurred any material fines or penalties or experienced any material adverse effects to our business as a result of any domestic or international regulations the summary below is based on regulations currently in effect and such regulations are subject to review and modification by the applicable governmental authority from time to time if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations we may be fined or even lose our rights to conduct some of our business 

united states 

 we are required to comply with a variety of federal state and local regulations and laws in the us including fcc and federal aviation administration faa regulations and those discussed under —environmental  below 

federal regulations  both the fcc and the faa regulate towers used for wireless communications radio and television broadcasting such regulations control the siting lighting and marking of towers and may depending on the characteristics of particular towers require the registration of tower facilities with the fcc and the issuance of determinations confirming no hazard to air traffic wireless communications devices operating on towers are separately regulated and independently licensed based upon the particular frequency used in addition the fcc and the faa have developed standards to consider proposals for new or modified tower and antenna structures based upon the height and location including proximity to airports proposals to construct 

or to modify existing tower and antenna structures above certain heights are reviewed by the faa to ensure the structure will not present a hazard to aviation which determination may be conditioned upon compliance with lighting and marking requirements the fcc requires its licensees to operate communications devices only on towers that comply with faa rules and are registered with the fcc if required by its regulations where tower lighting is required by faa regulation tower owners bear the responsibility of notifying the faa of any tower lighting outage and ensuring the timely restoration of such outages failure to comply with the applicable requirements may lead to civil penalties 

local regulations  the us telecommunications act of 1996 amended the communications act of 1934 to preserve state and local zoning authorities jurisdiction over the siting of communications towers and das the law however limits local zoning authority by prohibiting actions by local authorities that discriminate between different service providers of wireless services or ban altogether the provision of wireless services additionally the law prohibits state and local restrictions based on the environmental effects of radio frequency emissions to the extent the facilities comply with fcc regulations 

local regulations include city and other local ordinances including subdivision and zoning ordinances approvals for construction modification and removal of towers and das and restrictive covenants imposed by community developers these regulations vary greatly but typically require us to obtain approval from local officials prior to tower construction local zoning authorities may render decisions that prevent the construction or modification of towers or place conditions on such construction or modifications that are responsive to community residents concerns regarding the height visibility and other characteristics of the towers to expedite the deployment of wireless networks the fcc issued a declaratory ruling in 2009 establishing timeframes for the review of applications by local and state governments of 90 days for colocations and 150 days for new tower construction if a jurisdiction fails to act within these timeframes the applicant may file a claim for relief in court notwithstanding this declaratory ruling decisions of local zoning authorities may also adversely affect the timing and cost of tower construction and modification 

environmental we are required to comply with a variety of federal state and local environmental laws and regulations protecting environmental quality including air and water quality and wildlife protection to date we have not incurred any material fines or penalties or experienced any material adverse effects to our business as a result of any domestic or international environmental regulations or matters see item 1a risk factors 

the construction of new towers and in some cases the modification of existing towers in the us may be subject to environmental review under the national environmental policy act of 1969 as amended nepa which requires federal agencies to evaluate the environmental impact of major federal actions the fcc has promulgated regulations implementing nepa which require applicants to investigate the potential environmental impact of the proposed tower construction should the proposed tower construction present a significant environmental impact the fcc must prepare an environmental impact statement subject to public comment if the proposed construction or modification of a tower may have a significant impact on the environment the fccs approval of the construction or modification could be significantly delayed 

our operations are subject to federal state and local laws and regulations relating to the management use storage disposal emission and remediation of and exposure to hazardous and nonhazardous substances materials and wastes as an owner lessee or operator of real property we are subject to certain environmental laws that impose strict jointandseveral liability for the cleanup of onsite or offsite contamination relating to existing or historical operations and we could also be subject to personal injury or property damage claims relating to such contamination in general our customer contracts prohibit our customers from using or storing any hazardous substances on our tower sites in violation of applicable environmental laws and require our customers to provide notice of certain environmental conditions caused by them 

as licensees and wireless infrastructure owners we are also subject to regulations and guidelines that impose a variety of operational requirements relating to radio frequency emissions as employers we are subject to occupational safety and health administration and similar occupational health and safety legislation in australia and similar guidelines regarding employee protection from radio frequency exposure the potential connection between radio frequency emissions and certain negative health effects including some forms of cancer has been the subject of substantial study by the scientific community in recent years 

we have compliance programs and monitoring projects to help assure that we are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws nevertheless there can be no assurance that the costs of compliance with existing or future environmental laws will not have a material adverse effect on us 

other regulations  we hold through certain of our subsidiaries licenses for common carrier microwave service which are subject to additional regulation by the fcc our fcc license relating to our 16701675 mhz us nationwide spectrum license spectrum contains certain conditions related to the services that may be provided thereunder the technical equipment used in connection therewith and the circumstances under which it may be renewed in 2007 after receiving fcc approval we entered into a longterm lease of the spectrum with an initial term through 2013 

australia 

federal regulations  carrier licenses and nominated carrier declarations issued under the australian telecommunications act 1997 authorize the use of network units for the supply of telecommunications services to the public the definition of “network units” includes line links and base stations used for wireless voice services but does not include tower infrastructure accordingly ccal as a tower owner and operator does not require a carrier license under the australian telecommunications act 1997 similarly because ccal does not own any transmitters or spectrum it does not currently require any apparatus or spectrum licenses issued under the australian radiocommunications act 1992 

carriers have a statutory obligation to provide other carriers with access to towers and if there is a dispute including a pricing dispute the matter may be referred to the australian competition and consumer commission for resolution as a noncarrier ccal is not subject to this requirement and our customers negotiate site access on a commercial basis 

while the australian telecommunications act 1997 grants certain exemptions from planning laws for the installation of low impact facilities newly constructed towers are expressly excluded from the definition of low impact facilities accordingly in connection with the construction of towers ccal is subject to state and local planning laws that vary on a site by site basis typically requiring us to obtain approval from local government agencies prior to tower construction subject to certain exceptions structural enhancements may be undertaken on behalf of a carrier without state and local planning approval under the general maintenance power under the australian telecommunications act 1997 although these enhancements may be subject to state and local planning laws if ccal is unable to obtain carrier cooperation to use such power for a limited number of towers ccal is also required to install aircraft warning lighting in compliance with federal aviation regulations in australia a carrier may arguably be able to utilize the maintenance power under the australian telecommunications act 1997 to remain as a tenant on a tower after the expiration of a site license or sublease however ccals customer access agreements generally limit the ability of customers to do this and even if a carrier did utilize this power the carrier would be required to pay for ccals financial loss which would roughly equal the site rental revenues that would have otherwise been payable 

local regulations  in australia there are various local state and territory laws and regulations which relate to among other things town planning and zoning restrictions standards and approvals for the design construction or alteration of a structure or facility and environmental regulations as in the us these laws vary greatly but typically require tower owners to obtain approval from governmental bodies prior to tower construction and to comply with environmental laws on an ongoing basis 




 item 1a risk factors 

you should carefully consider all of the risks described below as well as the other information contained in this document when evaluating your investment in our securities 

our business depends on the demand for wireless communications and wireless infrastructure and we may be adversely affected by any slowdown in such demand additionally a reduction in carrier network investment may materially and adversely affect our business including reducing demand for new tenant additions and network services 

demand for our wireless infrastructure depends on the demand for antenna space from our customers which in turn depends on the demand for wireless voice and data services by their customers the willingness of our customers to utilize our wireless infrastructure or renew or extend existing contracts on our wireless infrastructure is affected by numerous factors including 

 a slowdown in demand for wireless communications or our wireless infrastructure may negatively impact our growth or 

otherwise have a material adverse effect on us over the last several years new entrants in the marketplace such as those providing wireless data technologies have accounted for a significant portion of our new tenant additions our expectations for future demand for our wireless infrastructure are based in part on new entrants into the wireless communications industry with unproven business models the success of new entrants can be influenced by numerous factors including the items described above particularly the availability and cost of capital and the success of their business models if our customers or potential customers are unable to raise adequate capital to fund their business plans as a result of disruptions in the financial and credit markets or otherwise they may reduce their spending which could adversely affect our anticipated growth and the demand for our wireless infrastructure and network services 

historically the amount of our customers network investment is cyclical and has varied based upon the various matters described in these risk factors changes in carrier network investment typically impact the demand for our wireless infrastructure as a result changes in carrier plans such as delays in the implementation of new systems new technologies or plans to expand coverage or capacity may reduce demand for our wireless infrastructure furthermore the wireless communication industry could experience a slowdown or slowing growth rates as a result of numerous factors including a reduction in consumer demand for wireless services and general economic conditions there can be no assurances that the weakness and uncertainty in the current economic environment will not adversely impact the wireless communications industry which may materially and adversely affect our business including by reducing demand for our wireless infrastructure and network services in addition such a slowdown may increase competition for site rental customers and network services a wireless communications industry slowdown or a reduction in carrier network investment may materially and adversely affect our business 

a substantial portion of our revenues is derived from a small number of customers and the loss consolidation or financial instability of any of our limited number of customers may materially decrease revenues and reduce demand for our wireless infrastructure and network services 

for 2011 approximately 74  of our consolidated revenues were derived from att sprint verizon wireless and tmobile which represented 23  21  19  and 11  respectively of our consolidated net revenues the loss of any one of our large customers as a result of bankruptcy insolvency consolidation network sharing roaming joint development resale agreements by our customers merger with other customers of ours or otherwise may result in 1 a material decrease in our revenues 2 uncollectible account receivables 3 an impairment of our deferred site rental receivables wireless infrastructure assets site rental contracts and customer relationships intangible assets and 4 other adverse effects to our business we cannot guarantee that contracts with our major customers will not be terminated or that these customers will renew their contracts with us in addition to our four largest customers in the us we also derive a portion of our revenues and anticipated future growth from customers offering or contemplating offering emerging wireless services such customers are smaller and have less financial resources than our four largest customers have business models which may not be successful and may require additional capital see also item 1 business—the company 

consolidation among our customers will likely result in duplicate or overlapping parts of networks which may result in a reduction of wireless infrastructure and impact revenues from our wireless infrastructure in addition consolidation may result in a reduction in such customers future capital expenditures in the aggregate because their expansion plans may be similar wireless carrier consolidation could decrease the demand for our wireless infrastructure which in turn may result in a reduction in our revenues and cash flows 

recent examples of consolidation include verizon wireless acquiring alltel in 2009 also sprint merged with nextel in august 2005 resulting in their use of two separate wireless technologies during 2010 sprint announced network vision a multiyear network enhancement to improve network speed quality and efficiency and consolidate their multiple network technologies including the elimination of their narrowband pushtotalk network referred to as iden sprint expects the network vision deployment to reach 250 million people by the end of 2013 sprints plan will likely result in sprint not renewing certain contracts with us 

our substantial level of indebtedness could adversely affect our ability to react to changes in our business and the terms of our debt instruments limit our ability to take a number of actions that our management might otherwise believe to be in our best interests in addition if we fail to comply with our covenants our debt could be accelerated 

as a result of our substantial indebtedness 

 

 currently we have debt instruments in place that limit in certain circumstances our ability to incur indebtedness pay dividends create liens sell assets and engage in certain mergers and acquisitions our subsidiaries under their debt instruments are also required to maintain specific financial ratios our ability to comply with the financial ratio covenants under these instruments and to satisfy our debt obligations will depend on our future operating performance if we fail to comply with the debt restrictions we will be in default under those instruments which would cause the maturity of a substantial portion of our longterm indebtedness to be accelerated if our operating subsidiaries were to default on the debt the trustee could seek to foreclose the collateral securing the debt in which case we could lose the wireless infrastructure and the revenues associated with the wireless infrastructure we are currently in compliance with our debt service coverage and leverage ratios see item 7 mda—liquidity and capital resources—debt covenants  for a further discussion of our debt covenants 

ccic and ccoc are holding companies that conduct all of their operations through their subsidiaries accordingly ccics and ccocs respective sources of cash to pay interest and principal on their outstanding indebtedness are distributions relating to their respective ownership interests in their subsidiaries from the net earnings and cash flows generated by such subsidiaries or from proceeds of debt or equity offerings earnings and cash flows generated by their subsidiaries are first applied by such subsidiaries to conduct their operations including servicing their respective debt obligations after which any excess cash flows generally may be paid to such holding company in the absence of any special conditions such as a continuing event of default however their subsidiaries are legally distinct from the holding companies and unless they guarantee such debt have no obligation to pay amounts due on their debt or to make funds available to us for such payment 

we have a substantial amount of indebtedness in the event we do not repay or refinance such indebtedness we could face substantial liquidity issues and might be required to issue equity securities or securities convertible into equity securities or sell some of our assets to meet our debt payment obligations 

we have a substantial amount of indebtedness approximately 80 billion as of december 31 2011  after giving effect to the wcp acquisition and our january 2012 refinancing which we will need to refinance or repay see item 7 mda—liquidity and capital resources  for a tabular presentation of our contractual debt maturities there can be no assurances we will be able to refinance our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or terms including with respect to interest rates as favorable as our current debt or at all 

economic conditions and the credit markets continue to experience a period of volatility uncertainty and weakness due to among other things the impact of uncertainty around european sovereign debt any renewed financial turmoil worsening credit environment european sovereign debt crisis weakening of the general economy and further uncertainty could impact the availability and cost of debt financing including with respect to any refinancing of the obligations described above and on our ability to draw the full amount of our 5000 million delayed draw term loan and our 10 billion revolving credit facility 

if we are unable to refinance or renegotiate our debt we cannot guarantee that we will be able to generate enough cash flows from operations or that we will be able to obtain enough capital to service our debt or fund our planned capital expenditures in such an event we could face substantial liquidity issues and might be required to issue equity securities or securities convertible into equity securities or sell some of our assets to meet our debt payment obligations failure to refinance indebtedness when required could result in a default under such indebtedness assuming we meet certain financial ratios we have the ability under our debt instruments to incur additional indebtedness and any additional indebtedness we incur could exacerbate the risks described above 

sales or issuances of a substantial number of shares of our common stock may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

future sales or issuances of a substantial number of shares of our common stock or other equity related securities may adversely affect the market price of our common stock as of february 6 2012 we had 2845 million shares of common stock outstanding and we reserved 81 million shares of common stock for future issuance under our various stock compensation plans we also expect to issue 83 million shares of our common stock in connection with preferred stock conversion in february 2012 

in addition a small number of stockholders own a significant percentage of our outstanding common stock if any one of these stockholders or any group of our stockholders sells a large quantity of shares of our common stock or the public market perceives that existing stockholders might sell a large quantity of shares of our common stock the market price of our common 

stock may significantly decline 

as a result of competition in our industry including from some competitors with significantly more resources or less debt than we have we may find it more difficult to achieve favorable rental rates on our new or renewing customer contracts 

our growth is dependent on entering into new customer contracts as well as renewing or renegotiating customer contracts when existing customer contracts terminate we face competition for site rental customers from various sources including 

 wireless carriers that own and operate their own wireless infrastructure portfolios are generally substantially larger and have greater financial resources than we have competition in our industry may make it more difficult for us to attract new customers maintain or increase our gross margins or maintain or increase our market share 

new technologies may significantly reduce demand for our wireless infrastructure and negatively impact our revenues 

improvements in the efficiency of wireless networks could reduce the demand for our wireless infrastructure for example signal combining technologies that permit one antenna to service multiple frequencies and thereby multiple customers may reduce the need for our wireless infrastructure in addition other technologies such as femtocells and satellite transmission systems such as low earth orbiting may in the future serve as substitutes for or alternatives to leasing that might otherwise be anticipated or expected on wireless infrastructure had such technologies not existed any significant reduction in wireless infrastructure leasing demand resulting from the previously mentioned technologies or other technologies may negatively impact our revenues or otherwise have a material adverse effect on us 

new wireless technologies may not deploy or be adopted by customers as rapidly or in the manner projected 

there can be no assurances that new wireless services and technologies will be introduced or deployed as rapidly or in the manner projected by the wireless or broadcast industries in addition demand and customer adoption rates for such new technologies may be lower or slower than anticipated for numerous reasons as a result growth opportunities and demand for our wireless infrastructure as a result of such technologies may not be realized at the times or to the extent anticipated 

if we fail to retain rights to our wireless infrastructure including the land interests under our towers our business may be adversely affected 

our property interests relating to the land interests on which our towers reside consist primarily of leasehold and subleasehold interests fee interests easements licenses and rightsofway a loss of these interests may interfere with our ability to conduct our business and generate revenues for various reasons we may not always have the ability to access analyze and verify all information regarding titles and other issues prior to purchasing wireless infrastructure further we may not be able to renew ground leases on commercially viable terms our ability to retain rights to the land interests on which our towers reside depends on our ability to purchase such land or to renegotiate and extend the terms of the leases relating to such land approximately 11  of our site rental gross margins for the year ended december 31 2011  are derived from towers where the leases for the land interests under such towers have final expiration dates of less than ten years if we are unable to retain rights to the land interests on which our towers reside our business may be adversely affected 

approximately 6500 of our towers are leased or operated for an initial period of 32 years through may 2037 under master leases and subleases with sprint sprint towers we have the option to purchase in 2037 all but not less than all of the sprint towers from sprint for approximately 23 billion we may not have the required available capital to exercise our right to purchase these towers at the end of the applicable period even if we do have available capital we may choose not to exercise our right to purchase the sprint towers for business or other reasons in the event that we do not exercise these purchase rights or are otherwise unable to acquire an interest that would allow us to continue to operate these towers after the applicable period we will lose the cash flows derived from such towers which may have a material adverse effect on our business in the event that we decide to exercise these purchase rights the benefits of the acquisition of the sprint towers may not exceed the costs which could adversely affect our business 

our network services business has historically experienced significant volatility in demand which reduces the predictability of our results 

the operating results of our network services business for any particular period may vary significantly and should not 

necessarily be considered indicative of longerterm results for this activity our network services business may be adversely impacted by various factors including competition economic weakness and uncertainty our market share and changes in the type and volume of work performed 

if we fail to comply with laws or regulations which regulate our business and which may change at any time we may be fined or even lose our right to conduct some of our business 

a variety of federal state local and foreign laws and regulations apply to our business including those discussed in item 1 business  failure to comply with applicable requirements may lead to civil penalties or require us to assume indemnification obligations or breach contractual provisions we cannot guarantee that existing or future laws or regulations including state and local tax laws will not adversely affect our business increase delays or result in additional costs these factors may have a material adverse effect on us 

if radio frequency emissions from wireless handsets or equipment on our wireless infrastructure are demonstrated to cause negative health effects potential future claims could adversely affect our operations costs and revenues 

the potential connection between radio frequency emissions and certain negative health effects including some forms of cancer has been the subject of substantial study by the scientific community in recent years we cannot guarantee that claims relating to radio frequency emissions will not arise in the future or that the results of such studies will not be adverse to us 

public perception of possible health risks associated with cellular and other wireless communications may slow or diminish the growth of wireless companies which may in turn slow or diminish our growth in particular negative public perception of and regulations regarding these perceived health risks may slow or diminish the market acceptance of wireless communications services if a connection between radio emissions and possible negative health effects were established our operations costs and revenues may be materially and adversely affected we currently do not maintain any significant insurance with respect to these matters 

certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation bylaws and operative agreements and domestic and international competition laws may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us or for us to acquire control of a third party even if such a change in control would be beneficial to our stockholders 

we have a number of antitakeover devices in place that will hinder takeover attempts and may reduce the market value of our common stock our antitakeover provisions include 

 our bylaws permit special meetings of the stockholders to be called only upon the request of our chief executive officer or a majority of the board of directors and deny stockholders the ability to call such meetings such provisions as well as the provisions of section 203 of the delaware general corporation law may impede a merger consolidation takeover or other business combination or discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us 

in addition domestic and international competition laws may prevent or discourage us from acquiring wireless infrastructure in certain geographical areas or impede a merger consolidation takeover or other business combination or discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us 

we may be adversely effected by exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates relating to our operations in australia 

our australian operations expose us to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates for 2011  approximately 6  of our consolidated net revenues were denominated in australian dollars over the past five years the australian dollar has strengthened by 29 against the us dollar we have not historically engaged in significant hedging activities relating to our australian operations and we may suffer future losses as a result of changes in currency exchange rates

offices 

our principal corporate headquarters is owned and located in houston texas in the us we own or lease area offices located in 1 canonsburg pennsylvania 2 charlotte north carolina 3 alpharetta georgia and 4 phoenix arizona the principal responsibilities of these area offices are to manage the renting of wireless infrastructure space on a local basis maintain the wireless infrastructure already located in the area and service our customers in the area in addition general and administrative functions are also performed at the canonsburg pennsylvania location in addition we lease additional smaller offices in locations with high wireless infrastructure concentrations in australia we lease an office in sydney 

wireless infrastructure 

towers are vertical metal structures generally ranging in height from 50 to 500 feet in addition wireless communications equipment may also be placed on building rooftops and other structures our towers are located on tracts of land with an average size of approximately 20000 square feet these tracts of land support the towers equipment shelters and where applicable guyed wires to stabilize the structure das are typically located in areas in which zoning restrictions or other barriers may prevent or delay the deployment of a tower and often are attached to public rightofway infrastructure such as utility poles and street lights 

see item 1 business—overview  for information regarding our wireless infrastructure portfolio including with respect to our land interests and for a discussion of the location of our towers in the us and australia including the percentage of our us towers in the top 50 and 100 btas see item 7 mda—liquidity and capital resources—contractual cash obligations  for a tabular presentation of the remaining terms to final expiration of the leases for the land interests which we do not own and on which our towers are located as of december 31 2011  

approximately 15700 towers 66 of our total and their related cash flows effectively secure 46 billion  of our debt governing documents relating to another approximately 4900 towers prevent liens from being granted on those towers without approval of a subsidiary of verizon however distributions paid from the entities that own those towers also service our tower revenue notes see note 6  to our consolidated financial statements 

approximately 6500 of our towers are leased or operated for an initial period of 32 years through may 2037 under master leases and subleases with sprint we have the option to purchase in 2037 all but not less than all of these sprint towers from sprint for approximately 23 billion 

substantially all of our wireless infrastructure can accommodate another tenant either as currently constructed or with appropriate modifications to the structure additionally if so inclined as a result of a customer request for a new colocation or amendment of an existing installation we could generally replace an existing tower with another tower in its place providing additional capacity subject to certain restrictions as of december 31 2011  the average number of tenants defined as a unique license and any related amendments thereto for count purposes per tower is approximately 3 on our towers the following is a summary of the number of existing tenants per tower as of december 31 2011  see item 7 mda—accounting and reporting matters—critical accounting policies and estimates  for a discussion of our impairment evaluation and our towers with no tenants 

  




 item 3 legal proceedings 

we are periodically involved in legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business most of these proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business involve disputes with landlords vendors collection matters involving bankrupt customers zoning and variance matters condemnation or wrongful termination claims while the outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty management does not expect any pending matters to have a material adverse effect on us

our reportable operating segments for 2011  are 1 ccusa primarily consisting of our us operations and 2 ccal our australian operations our financial results are reported to management and the board of directors in this manner 

see note 16  to our consolidated financial statements for segment results and a reconciliation of net income loss to adjusted ebitda defined below 

our measurement of profit or loss currently used to evaluate our operating performance and operating segments is earnings before interest taxes depreciation amortization and accretion as adjusted adjusted ebitda our measure of adjusted ebitda may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies including companies in the tower sector and other similar providers of wireless infrastructure and is not a measure of performance calculated in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 

we define adjusted ebitda as net income loss plus restructuring charges credits asset writedown charges acquisition and integration costs depreciation amortization and accretion interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs gains losses on retirement of longterm obligations net gain loss on interest rate swaps impairment of availableforsale securities interest income other income expense benefit provision for income taxes cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle income loss from discontinued operations and stockbased compensation expense see note 12  to our consolidated financial statements the reconciliation of adjusted ebitda to our net income loss is set forth in note 16  to our consolidated financial statements adjusted ebitda is not intended as an alternative measure of operating results or cash flows from operations as determined in accordance with gaap and adjusted ebitda may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies adjusted ebitda is discussed further under item 7 mda — accounting and reporting matters—nongaap financial measures 

ccusa— 2011  and 2010   net revenues for 2011  increased by 1303 million  or 7  from 2010  this increase in net revenues resulted from an increase in site rental revenues of 1369 million  or 9  for the same periods this increase in site rental revenues was impacted by the following items inclusive of straightline accounting in no particular order new tenant additions across our entire portfolio renewals or extensions of customer contracts escalations and cancellations of customer contracts see item 7 mda—accounting and reporting matters—critical accounting policies and estimates  for a further discussion of our revenue recognition policies tenant additions were influenced by the previously mentioned growth in the wireless communications industry see also item 1 business—the company—ccusa 

site rental gross margins for 2011  increased by 1278 million  or 11  from 2010  the increase in the site rental gross margins was related to the previously mentioned 9  increase in site rental revenues site rental gross margins for 2011  increased primarily as a result of the high incremental margins associated with tenant additions given the relatively fixed costs to operate wireless infrastructure the 1278 million  incremental margin represents 93  of the related increase in site rental revenues 

network services and other revenues for 2011  decreased by 66 million  or 4  from 2010  and the related gross margin increased by 50 million  or 8  from 2010  the increase in our gross margin from our network services and other revenues is a reflection of the general volatility in the volume and mix of such work our network services business is of a variable nature as these revenues are not under longterm contracts 

general and administrative expenses for 2011  increased by 34 million  or 2  from 2010  general and administrative expenses are inclusive of stockbased compensation charges as discussed further in note 12  to our consolidated financial statements general and administrative expenses increased primarily as a result of das operations driven by our acquisition of newpath in 2010 general and administrative expenses were 8  of net revenues for both 2011  and 2010  typically our general and administrative expenses do not significantly increase as a result of new tenant additions on our wireless infrastructure 

adjusted ebitda for 2011  increased by 1255 million  or 11  from 2010  adjusted ebitda was positively impacted by the growth in our site rental business including the high incremental site rental margin on the tenant additions 

depreciation amortization and accretion for 2011  increased by 92 million  or 2  from 2010  this increase is consistent with the insignificant movement in our fixed assets and intangible assets which did not materially change between 2010  and 2011  

during 2010  we repaid or purchased 34 billion of face value of debt using cash from our issuances of debt in order to extend the maturities of our debt portfolio as a result of purchasing and early retiring certain of our debt we incurred a net loss of 1384 million  for 2010  inclusive of make whole payments during 2010  we realized losses on interest rate swaps of 2864 million  which predominately resulted from an increase in the liability for those swaps not subject to hedge accounting due to changes in the libor yield curve all of our forwardstarting swaps were settled during 2010 so no further cash outflows associated with these swaps will occur the increase in interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs of 184 million  or 4  in 2011  resulted predominately from a 175 million  increase in the amortization of interest rate swaps primarily related to the loss realized in 2010 on the swaps hedging the refinancing of the 2006 tower revenue notes for a further discussion of the debt refinancings and the interest rate swaps see notes 6  and 7  to our consolidated financial statements item 7 mda—liquidity and capital resources  and item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk   

benefit provision for income taxes for 2011  was a provision of 61 million  compared to a benefit of 288 million  for 2010  for 2010 and 2011 the effective tax rate differs from the statutory rate predominately due to our federal deferred valuation allowances in addition 2010  included 198 million of federal tax benefits recorded predominately as a result of discrete events including acquisitions 

net income loss attributable to ccic stockholders for 2011  was income of 1681 million  net income loss attributable to ccic stockholders for 2010  was a loss of 3102 million  inclusive of 1 net losses from interest rate swaps of 2864 million  and 2 net losses from repayments and purchases and early retirement of debt of 1384 million  the change from net loss to net income was predominately due to 1 the previously mentioned charges and 2 growth in our site rental and service businesses 

ccal— 2011  and 2010   the increases and decreases between 2011  and 2010  were inclusive of exchange rate fluctuations the average exchange rate of australian dollars expressed in us dollars for 2011  was approximately 103  an increase of 12  from approximately 092  for the same period in the prior year see item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

total net revenues for 2011  increased by 238 million  or 23  from 2010  site rental revenues for 2011  increased by 159 million  or 17  from 2010  the increase in the exchange rate positively impacted net revenues and site rental revenues by approximately 139 million  and 119 million  respectively and accounted for an increase of 14 and 13 respectively for 2011  from 2010  site rental revenues were also impacted by various other factors inclusive of straightline accounting including in no particular order tenant additions on our wireless infrastructure renewals of customer contracts escalations and cancellations of customer contracts net revenues were also impacted by a 79 million  increase in network services and other revenues 

site rental gross margins increased by 107 million  or 17  for 2011  from 633 million  and adjusted ebitda for 2011  increased by 94 million  or 18  from 530 million the increase in the site rental gross margin and adjusted ebitda were primarily due to exchange rate fluctuations 

net income loss attributable to ccic stockholders for 2011  was a net income of 30 million  compared to net loss of 07 million  for 2010  the change from net loss to net income was primarily related to the previously mentioned increase in net revenues 

ccusa— 2010  and 2009   net revenues for 2010  increased by 1751 million  or 11  from 2009  this increase in net revenues resulted from an increase in site rental revenues of 1416 million  or 10  for the same periods this increase in site rental revenues was impacted by the following items inclusive of straightline accounting in no particular order new tenant additions across our entire portfolio renewals or extensions of customer contracts escalations and cancellations of customer contracts see item 7 mda—accounting and reporting matters—critical accounting policies and estimates  for a further discussion of our revenue recognition policies tenant additions were influenced by the previously mentioned growth in the wireless communications industry we amended a site rental contract with one of our four largest customers during 2010 to provide the customer with the ability to add equipment to its existing antennas on our wireless infrastructure without the need to pay additional rent on individual amendments at each tower with limited exceptions in exchange for an increase in rent on the customers existing contracts during 2010 we continued to derive a large portion of our site rental revenues from the four largest wireless carriers in the us although a significant portion of our new tenant additions were from customers offering emerging wireless services such as those offering wireless data only technologies including clearwire a provider of wireless mobile internet services see also item 1 business—the company—ccusa 

site rental gross margins for 2010  increased by 1373 million  or 13  from 2009  the increase in site rental gross margins was related to the previously mentioned 10 increase in site rental revenues site rental gross margins for 2010  increased primarily as a result of the high incremental margins associated with tenant additions given the relatively fixed costs to operate wireless infrastructure the 1373 million  incremental margin represents 97  of the related increase in site rental revenues 

network services and other revenues for 2010  increased by 336 million  or 25  from 2009  and the related gross margin increased by 143 million  or 31  from 2009  our network services business is of a variable nature as these revenues are not 

under longterm contracts the increase in our network services and other revenues reflect our increased market share as well as the general volatility in the volume and mix of such work we were able to achieve this growth in revenues while modestly expanding our related gross margin 

general and administrative expenses for 2010  increased by 72 million  or 5  from 2009  but decreased to 8 of net revenues from 9 general and administrative expenses are inclusive of stockbased compensation charges which increased by 68 million from 2009 to 2010 as discussed further in note 12  to our consolidated financial statements the increase in stockbased compensation was driven by the furthered emphasis on the longterm incentive compensation component of total compensation for senior management which we believe further aligns compensation with stockholder value typically our general and administrative expenses do not significantly increase as a result of new tenant additions on our wireless infrastructure 

adjusted ebitda for 2010  increased by 1516 million or 16 from 2009  adjusted ebitda was positively impacted by the growth in our site rental and services businesses including the high incremental site rental margin on the new tenant additions 

depreciation amortization and accretion for 2010  increased by 114 million  or 2 from 2009  the small increase is consistent with the movement in our fixed assets and intangible assets which did not materially change between 2009 and 2010 

during 2009  and 2010  we refinanced the vast majority of our debt in order to extend and ladder the maturities of our debt portfolio this refinancing activity included purchasing and early retiring certain of our debt resulting in a net loss of 1384 million  for 2010  inclusive of make whole payments the increase in interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs of 449 million  or 10  in 2010  resulted predominately from 1 a 354 million  increase in the amortization of interest rate swaps primarily related to the loss on the swaps hedging the refinancing of the 2005 tower revenue notes and the 2006 tower revenue notes and 2 the net impact of our various refinancings during 2010  we realized losses on interest rate swaps of 2864 million  which predominately resulted from an increase in the liability due to changes in the libor yield curve for those swaps not subject to hedge accounting as of december 31 2010  all of our forwardstarting interest rate swaps are settled for a further discussion of the debt refinancings and the interest rate swaps see notes 6  and 7  to our consolidated financial statements item 7 mda—liquidity and capital resources  and item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk   

benefit provision for income taxes for 2010  was a benefit of 288 million  compared to a benefit of 777 million  for 2009  as further discussed in note 9  to our consolidated financial statements we were limited in our ability to recognize federal tax benefits on our losses during 2010 except for 198 million of federal tax benefits recorded predominately as a result of discrete events including acquisitions as of december 31 2010  we are unable to recognize additional federal tax benefits in future periods unless discrete events allow us to record additional deferred tax liabilities tax benefits for 2010 predominately reflect our recognition of federal tax benefits on our losses and a reversal of 206 million of state tax valuation allowance 

net income loss attributable to ccic stockholders for 2010  was a loss of 3102 million  inclusive of 1 net losses from interest rate swaps of 2864 million  and 2 net losses from repayments and purchases and early retirement of debt of 1384 million  net income loss attributable to ccic stockholders for 2009  was a loss of 1154 million  inclusive of 1 net losses from repayments and purchases and early retirement of debt of 911 million  and 2 net losses from interest rate swaps of 930 million  the increase in net loss was predominately due to 1 the previously mentioned charges and benefits and 2 the previously mentioned increase in interest expense of 449 million  partially offset by 3 growth in our site rental and service businesses 

ccal— 2010  and 2009   the increases and decreases between 2010  and 2009  are inclusive of exchange rate fluctuations the average exchange rate of australian dollars to us dollars for 2010  was approximately 092 an increase of 16 from approximately 079 for the same period in the prior year see item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

total net revenues for 2010  increased by 181 million  or 21  from 2009  site rental revenues for 2010  increased by 160 million  or 21  from 2009  the increase in the exchange rate positively impacted net revenues and site rental revenues by approximately 143 million and 129 million respectively and accounted for an increase of 17 in both net revenues and site rental revenues for 2010  from 2009  site rental revenues were also impacted by various other factors inclusive of straightline accounting including in no particular order new tenant additions on our wireless infrastructure renewals of customer contracts escalations and cancellations of customer contracts 

site rental gross margins increased by 97 million  or 18  for 2010  from 536 million  and adjusted ebitda for 2010  increased by 70 million or 15 from 2010  the increase in the site rental gross margin and adjusted ebitda were predominately due to exchange rate fluctuations 

net income loss attributable to ccic stockholders for 2010  was a net loss of 07 million  compared to a net income of 11 million for 2009 the change from net income to net loss was predominately due to the following exclusive of the impact 

from exchange rate fluctuations 1 an increase in interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs the majority of which was due to an increase in the variable interest rate of our intercompany debt 2 an increase in general and administrative expenses due to an increase in stockbased compensation and 3 lower depreciation expense for 2011 as a result of recording depreciation expense for towers that were acquired in 2008 with short useful lives for accounting purposes driven by the short term of the underlying ground lease 

liquidity and capital resources 

overview 

general  we believe our site rental business can be characterized as a stable cash flow stream generated by revenues under longterm contracts see item 7 mda—general overview—overview  since we became a public company in 1998 our cumulative net cash provided by operating activities net of cash interest payments has exceeded our capital expenditures and provided us with cash available for discretionary investments for the foreseeable future we expect to continue to generate net cash provided by operating activities that exceeds our capital expenditures and will be available for discretionary investments in addition to investing net cash provided by operating activities in certain circumstances we may also use debt financings and issuances of equity or equity related securities to fund discretionary investments 

we seek to allocate the net cash provided by our operating activities in a manner that will enhance per share operating results our historical discretionary investments include in no particular order purchasing our common stock acquiring or constructing wireless infrastructure acquiring land interests under our towers improving and structurally enhancing our existing wireless infrastructure and purchasing or redeeming our debt 

we seek to maintain a capital structure that we believe drives longterm stockholder value and optimizes our weightedaverage cost of capital we target a leverage ratio of approximately four to six times adjusted ebitda and interest coverage of approximately three times adjusted ebitda subject to various factors such as the availability and cost of capital and the potential longterm return on our discretionary investments we may choose to increase or decrease our leverage and coverage from these targets for various periods of time 

we have never declared or paid cash dividends on our common stock currently we endeavor to utilize our net cash provided by operating activities to engage in discretionary investments we seek to maintain flexibility in our discretionary investments with both net cash provided by operating activities and cash available from financing capacity periodically our board of directors assesses the advisability of declaring and paying cash dividends at some point in the future based on the thencurrent and anticipated future conditions including our earnings net cash provided by operating activities capital requirements financial condition our relative market capitalization taxable income taxpayer status and other factors deemed relevant by the board of directors 

we pay minimal cash income taxes as a result of our net operating loss carryforwards we may generate taxable income in the future and if so we may utilize all or a portion of our 25 billion of federal net operating losses to offset such income if we were to approach the exhaustion of our net operating loss carryforwards or if there were relevant tax law changes we would evaluate our options with respect to appropriately managing our tax position  these options may include a conversion to a real estate investment trust reit which would require the payment of dividends on our common stock if we were to convert to a reit we expect that certain subsidiaries would not qualify as a reit and would continue to be subject to corporate income taxes 

liquidity position  the following is a summary of our capitalization and liquidity position after giving effect to the wcp acquisition the january 2012 refinancing and the preferred stock conversion expected to occur in february 2012 see item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  and notes 6  and 8  to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our debt 



 

 

during january 2012 we refinanced our credit facility through 1 a 5000 million undrawn delayed draw term loan due in 2017 2 a 16 billion term loan due in 2019 and 3 a 10 billion undrawn revolving credit facility due in 2017 this refinancing effectively extended the maturity of our credit facility and provided funding for the wcp acquisition and the anticipated acquisition of the nextg for approximately 10 billion of cash subject to adjustment which is expected to close in the second quarter of 2012 see notes 6  and 20  to our consolidated financial statements 

over the next 12 months 

 summary cash flows information   



operating activities 

the increase in net cash provided by operating activities for 2011  from 2010  and 2009  was due primarily to growth in our core site rental business partially offset by changes in working capital the yearoveryear decrease in working capital from 2010 to 2011 of 863 million  resulted primarily from changes in deferred site rental receivables and deferred revenues changes in working capital and particularly changes in deferred site rental receivables deferred rental revenues prepaid ground leases restricted cash and accrued interest can have a significant impact on net cash provided by operating activities largely due to the timing of prepayments and receipts we expect net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december 31 2011 will be sufficient to cover the next 12 months of our expected debt service obligations and capital expenditures we expect to grow our net cash provided by operating activities in the future exclusive of movements in working capital if we realize expected growth in our site rental business 

investing activities 

capital expenditures  we categorize our capital expenditures as sustaining or discretionary sustaining capital expenditures include capitalized costs related to 1 maintenance activities on our wireless infrastructure which are generally related to replacements and upgrades that extend the life of the asset 2 vehicles 3 information technology equipment and 4 office equipment discretionary capital expenditures which we also commonly refer to as revenuegenerating capital expenditures include 1 purchases of land interests under towers 2 wireless infrastructure improvements in order to support additional site rentals and 3 the construction of wireless infrastructure 

a summary of our capital expenditures for the last three years is as follows   



other than sustaining capital expenditures which we expect to be approximately 22 million to 27 million for the year ended december 31 2012 our capital expenditures are discretionary and are made with respect to activities which we believe exhibit sufficient potential to improve our longterm results of operations on a per share basis we expect to use roughly 350 million of our cash flows on capital expenditures sustaining and discretionary for full year 2012 with less than onefourth of our total capital expenditures targeted for our existing wireless infrastructure assets related to customer installations and related capacity improvement our decisions regarding capital expenditures are influenced by the availability and cost of capital and expected returns on alternative investments the following is a discussion of certain aspects of our capital expenditures 

 acquisitions see note 20  for a discussion of the definitive agreement to acquire nextg and the wcp acquisition see note 3  for a discussion of the acquisition of newpath in 2010 

financing activities 

we seek to allocate cash generated by our operations in a manner that will enhance per share operating results which may include various financing activities such as in no particular order purchasing our common stock and purchasing or redeeming our debt during 2010 and 2009 we extended the maturities of our debt by issuing an aggregate 63 billion face value of debt and purchased and repaid 58 billion face value of debt since the beginning of 2009  we have purchased an aggregate of 116 million shares of common stock for 4659 million which we believe is consistent with our objective to drive per share operating results in the beginning of 2012 our financing activities predominately related to refinancing our credit facility which effectively extended the maturity of our credit facility as well as provided funding for the wcp acquisition and the expected closing of the nextg acquisition see item 7 mda—liquidity and capital resources—overview and note 20  to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the january 2012 refinancing 

incurrence of debt   see note 6  to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our issuances of debt during 2009 and 2010 which extended the maturities of our debt portfolio as of december 31 2011  71 of our ccusa towers and the cash flows from these towers effectively secure 46 billion  of our debt in addition distributions paid from our entities that hold approximately 4900 towers will also service this secured debt in addition nearly all of the third party land interests and other assets acquired in the wcp acquisition and the cash flows derived therefrom are effectively pledged as security on the debt assumed in connection with the wcp acquisition see item 7 mda—liquidity and capital resources—overview—liquidity position and note 20  to our consolidated financial statements for a further discussion on the refinancing of our credit facility in january 2012 

debt purchases and repayments  see note 6  to our consolidated financial statements for a summary of our purchases and repayments of debt during 2009 and 2010 including the gains losses on retirement of longterm obligations see note 20  to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the refinancing of our credit facility in january 2012 

interest rate swaps  during 2010 we settled all of our forwardstarting interest rate swaps see note 7  to our consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of interest rate swaps 

common stock and preferred stock activity  as of december 31 2011  2010  and 2009  we had 2844 million  2908 million  and 2927 million common shares outstanding respectively during 2011 we purchased 74 million shares of common stock at an average price of 4112 per share utilizing 3034 million in cash we may continue to purchase our common stock in the future as we seek to allocate capital to discretionary investments in a manner that we believe will enhance per share results during 2011 we paid 150 million to purchase a portion of our 625 redeemable convertible preferred stock thereby reducing the number of common shares issuable upon conversion of such preferred stock by 03 million in january 2012 we exercised our right to convert all of the outstanding 625 redeemable convertible preferred stock into 83 million shares of common stock see item 1 business—strategy  and note 20  to our consolidated financial statements 

revolving credit facility   the proceeds of our revolving credit facility may be used for general corporate purposes which may include the financing of capital expenditures acquisitions and purchases of our common stock typically we use our revolving credit facility to fund discretionary investments and not for operating activities such as working capital which are typically funded by net cash provided by operating activities as of february 6 2012 there were no amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility see item 7 mda—liquidity and capital resources—overview and note 20  to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our january 2012 refinancing 

restricted cash  pursuant to the indentures governing our operating companies debt securities all rental cash receipts of the issuers of these debt instruments and their subsidiaries are restricted and held by an indenture trustee the restricted cash in excess of required reserve balances is subsequently released to us in accordance with the terms of the indentures see also notes 2  and 6  to our consolidated financial statements 

contractual cash obligations 

the following table summarizes our contractual cash obligations as of december 31 2011  after giving effect to the wcp acquisition the january 2012 refinancing and the preferred stock conversion these contractual cash obligations relate primarily to our outstanding borrowings and lease obligations for land interests under our towers the debt maturities reflect contractual maturity dates and do not consider the impact of the principal payments that will commence following the anticipated repayment dates on the tower revenue notes see footnote c   



     

 

2040 the full year 2011 excess cash flow of the issuers of the wcp securitized notes was approximately 17 million in connection with the wcp acquisition we acquired restricted cash of 295 million that if not spent on towers or third party land interests by november 2012 will be required to be used to repay principal amounts outstanding on the wcp securitized notes 

 the following table summarizes our rights to the land interests under our towers including renewal terms at our option as of december 31 2011  as of december 31 2011 the leases for land interests under our towers had an average remaining life of approximately 31 years weighted based on site rental gross margin see item 1a risk factors   



   

 debt covenants 

our debt obligations contain certain financial covenants with which ccic or our subsidiaries must maintain compliance in order to avoid the imposition of certain restrictions various of our debt obligations also place other restrictions on ccic or our subsidiaries which may include the ability to incur debt and liens purchase our securities make capital expenditures dispose of assets undertake transactions with affiliates make other investments and pay dividends we are permitted to issue additional indebtedness at ccic and at our operating subsidiaries subject to compliance with the covenants governing our debt including the below mentioned restrictive covenants and meeting certain other requirements which may include obtaining rating agency confirmations see note 6  to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our debt covenants 

factors that are likely to determine our subsidiaries ability to comply with their current and future debt covenants include their 1 financial performance 2 levels of indebtedness and 3 debt service requirements given the current level of indebtedness and debt services requirements of our subsidiaries the primary risk of a debt covenant violation would be from a deterioration of a subsidiarys financial performance should a covenant violation occur in the future as a result of a shortfall in financial performance or for any other reason we might be required to make principal payments earlier than currently scheduled and may not have access to additional borrowings under these debt instruments as long as the covenant violation continues if we fail to comply with the debt restrictions we will be in default under those instruments which could cause the maturity of a substantial portion of our longterm indebtedness to be accelerated if our operating subsidiaries were to default on the debt the trustee could seek to pursue the collateral securing the debt in which case we could lose the wireless infrastructure and the future revenues associated with such wireless infrastructure we currently have no financial covenant violations and based upon our current expectations we believe our operating results will be sufficient to comply with our debt covenants over the near and longterm see item 1a risk factors 

the following are the ratios applicable to the financial maintenance restrictive and cash trap reserve covenants under our debt agreements after giving effect to the wcp acquisition and the january 2012 refinancing 



 

 offbalance sheet arrangements 

we have no offbalance sheet arrangements as defined in item 303a4ii of regulation sk 

accounting and reporting matters 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the following is a discussion of the accounting policies and estimates that we believe 1 are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and 2 require our most difficult subjective or complex judgments often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain the critical accounting policies and estimates for 2011  are not intended to be a comprehensive list of our accounting policies and estimates see note 2  to our consolidated financial statements for a summary of our significant accounting policies in many cases the accounting treatment of a particular 

transaction is specifically dictated by gaap with no need for managements judgment in other cases management is required to exercise judgment in the application of accounting principles with respect to particular transactions 

revenue recognition  over 91 of our total revenue for 2011  consists of site rental revenues which are recognized on a monthly basis over the fixed noncancelable term of the relevant contract generally ranging from five to 15 years regardless of whether the payments from the customer are received in equal monthly amounts if the payment terms call for fixed escalations as in fixed dollar or fixed percentage increases or rent free periods the effect is recognized on a straightline basis over the fixed noncancelable term of the contract when calculating our straightline rental revenues we consider all fixed elements of tenant contractual escalation provisions even if such escalation provisions contain a variable element such as an escalator tied to an inflationbased index in addition to a minimum any upfront billings to customers for their negotiated share of the cost of wireless infrastructure modifications required to accommodate the installation of customer equipment are initially deferred and recognized over the term of the applicable site rental contract since we recognize revenue on a straightline basis a portion of the site rental revenue in a given period represents cash collected or contractually collectible in other periods we record a deferred site rental receivable for the difference between the straightlined amount and the rent billed we record an allowance for uncollectible deferred site rental revenues for which increases or reversals of this allowance impact our site rental revenues see note 2  to our consolidated financial statements 

we provide network services relating to our wireless infrastructure which represent less than 9 of our total revenues for 2011  network services and other revenue relate to installation services as well as the following additional site development services relating to existing and new antenna installations on our wireless infrastructure site acquisition architectural and engineering zoning and permitting fiber installations other construction and other services related to network development network services revenues are recognized after completion of the applicable service we account for network services separately from the customers subsequent site rental 

see item 1 business—ccusa  for a further discussion of our site rental and network services business 

accounting for longlived assets — valuation  as of december 31 2011  our largest asset was our telecommunications towers representing approximately 36 billion or 73 of our 49 billion  in net book value of property and equipment followed by intangible assets and goodwill approximately 22 billion  and 20 billion  in net book value respectively resulting predominately from the global signal merger in 2007 and other acquisitions of large tower portfolios nearly all approximately 21 billion  net book value at december 31 2011  of our identifiable intangibles relate to the site rental contracts and customer relationships intangible assets see note 2  to our consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the nature and composition of the site rental contracts and customer relationships intangible assets 

for our business combinations we allocate the purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair value at the date of acquisition any purchase price in excess of the net fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is allocated to goodwill the fair value of the vast majority of our assets and liabilities is determined by using either 

 the purchase price allocation requires subjective estimates that if incorrectly estimated could be material to our consolidated financial statements including the amount of depreciation amortization and accretion expense the most important estimates for measurement of tangible fixed assets are 1 the cost to replace the asset with a new asset and 2 the economic useful life after giving effect to age quality and condition the most important estimates for measurement of intangible assets are 1 discount rates and 2 timing and amount of cash flows including estimates regarding customer renewals and cancellations the determination of the final purchase price allocation could extend over several quarters resulting in the use of preliminary estimates that are subject to adjustment until finalized 

we record the fair value of obligations to perform certain asset retirement activities including requirements pursuant to our ground leases and easements to remove wireless infrastructure or remediate the land upon which our wireless infrastructure resides in determining the fair value of these asset retirement obligations we must make several subjective and highly judgmental estimates such as those related to 1 timing of cash flows 2 future costs 3 discount rates and 4 the probability of enforcement to remove the wireless infrastructure or remediate the land see note 2  to our consolidated financial statements 

accounting for longlived assets — useful lives  we are required to make subjective assessments as to the useful lives of our tangible and intangible assets for purposes of determining depreciation amortization and accretion expense that if incorrectly estimated could be material to our consolidated financial statements depreciation expense for our property and equipment is computed using the straightline method over the estimated useful lives of our various classes of tangible assets the substantial portion of our property and equipment represents the cost of our wireless infrastructure which is depreciated with an estimated 

useful life equal to the shorter of 1 20 years or 2 the term of the lease including optional renewals for the land interests under the wireless infrastructure 

the useful life of our intangible assets are estimated based on the period over which the intangible asset is expected to benefit us and gives consideration to the expected useful life of other assets to which the useful life may relate amortization expense for intangible assets is computed using the straightline method over the estimated useful life of each of the intangible assets the useful life of the site rental contracts and customer relationships intangible assets is limited by the maximum depreciable life of the wireless infrastructure 20 years as a result of the interdependency of the wireless infrastructure and site rental contracts and customer relationships in contrast the site rental contracts and customer relationships are estimated to provide economic benefits for several decades because of the low rate of customer cancellations and high rate of renewals experienced to date thus while site rental contracts and customer relationships are valued based upon the fair value of the site rental contracts and customer relationships which includes assumptions regarding both 1 customers exercise of optional renewals contained in the acquired contracts and 2 renewals of the acquired contracts past the contractual term including exercisable options the site rental contracts are amortized over a period not to exceed 20 years as a result of the useful life being limited by the depreciable life of the wireless infrastructure 

accounting for longlived assets — impairment evaluation — intangibles  we review the carrying values of property and equipment intangible assets and other longlived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable we utilize the following dual grouping policy for purposes of determining the unit of account for testing impairment of the site rental contracts and customer relationships 

 we first pool site rental contracts and customer relationships intangible assets and property and equipment into portfolio groups for purposes of determining the unit of account for impairment testing because we view wireless infrastructure as portfolios and wireless infrastructure in a given portfolio and its related customer contracts are not largely independent of the other wireless infrastructure in the portfolio we reevaluate the appropriateness of the pooled groups at least annually this use of grouping is based in part on 1 our limitations regarding disposal of wireless infrastructure 2 the interdependencies of wireless infrastructure portfolios and 3 the manner in which wireless infrastructure is traded in the marketplace the vast majority of our site rental contracts and customer relationships intangible assets and property and equipment are pooled into the us owned wireless infrastructure group secondly and separately we pool site rental contracts and customer relationships by significant customer or by customer grouping for individually insignificant customers as appropriate for purposes of determining the unit of account for impairment testing because we associate the value ascribed to site rental contracts and customer relationships intangible assets to the underlying contracts and related customer relationships acquired 

our determination that an adverse event or change in circumstance has occurred that indicates that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable will generally involve 1 a deterioration in an assets financial performance compared to historical results 2 a shortfall in an assets financial performance compared to forecasted results or 3 changes affecting the utility and estimated future demands for the asset when considering the utility of our assets we consider events that would meaningfully impact 1 our wireless infrastructure or 2 our customer relationships for example consideration would be given to events that impact 1 the structural integrity and longevity of our wireless infrastructure or 2 our ability to derive benefit from our existing customer relationships including events such as bankruptcy or insolvency or loss of a significant customer during 2011  there were no events or circumstances that caused us to review the carrying value of our intangible assets and property and equipment due in part to our assets performing consistently with or better than our expectations 

if the sum of the estimated future cash flows undiscounted from an asset or portfolio group significant customer or customer group for individually insignificant customers as applicable is less than its carrying amount an impairment loss may be recognized if the carrying value were to exceed the undiscounted cash flows measurement of an impairment loss would be based on the fair value of the asset which is based on an estimate of discounted future cash flows the most important estimates for such calculations of undiscounted cash flows are 1 the expected additions of new tenants and equipment on our wireless infrastructure and 2 estimates regarding customer cancellations and renewals of contracts we could record impairments in the future if changes in longterm market conditions expected future operating results or the utility of the assets results in changes for our impairment test calculations which negatively impact the fair value of our property and equipment and intangible assets or if we changed our unit of account in the future 

when grouping assets into pools for purposes of impairment evaluation we also consider individual towers nodes and third party land interests within a grouping for which we currently have no tenants approximately 3  of our total towers currently 

have no tenants we continue to pay operating expenses on these towers in anticipation of obtaining tenants on these towers in the future primarily because of the individual tower site demographics in fact we have current visibility to potential tenants on approximately half of these towers to the extent we do not believe there are longterm prospects of obtaining tenants on an individual tower node or third party land interest and all other possible avenues for recovering the carrying value has been exhausted including sale of the asset we appropriately reduce the carrying value of such assets 

accounting for longlived assets — impairment evaluation — goodwill   nearly all of our goodwill is recorded at ccusa we test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis regardless of whether adverse events or changes in circumstances have occurred the annual test begins with goodwill and all intangible assets being allocated to applicable reporting units we then perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount if it is concluded that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount it is necessary to perform the twostep goodwill impairment test otherwise the twostep goodwill impairment test is not required our reporting units are the operating segments since segment management operates their respective wireless infrastructure portfolios as a single network 

we performed our annual goodwill impairment test as of october 1 2011 utilizing the qualitative assessment we determined that the more likely than not threshold was achieved and no further testing of goodwill was required this assessment was based in part on the fair value of our net assets as measured by our market capitalization exceeding by over five times the aggregate carrying amount of the reporting units as of december 31 2011  

deferred income taxes  we record deferred income tax assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet related to events that impact our financial statements and tax returns in different periods in order to compute these deferred tax balances we first analyze the differences between the book basis and tax basis of our assets and liabilities referred to as temporary differences these temporary differences are then multiplied by current tax rates to arrive at the balances for the deferred income tax assets and liabilities a valuation allowance is provided on deferred tax assets that do not meet the more likely than not realization threshold we recognize a tax position if it is more likely than not it will be sustained upon examination the tax position is measured at the largest amount that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement if our expectations about the future tax consequences of past events should prove to be inaccurate the balances of our deferred income tax assets and liabilities could require significant adjustments in future periods such adjustments could cause a material effect on our results of operations for the period of the adjustment 

before giving effect to any valuation allowances we are in an overall net deferred tax asset position in the us and australia during 2011 in our judgment the deferred tax assets did not meet the more likely than not realization threshold under gaap principally due to our recent history of substantial losses and as a result we continued to record a valuation allowance fully offsetting our net deferred tax assets our us federal and australia valuation allowances comprise the majority of the total allowance and amounted to 1302 million and 641 million respectively as of december 31 2011 although we reported pretax earnings in 2011 because of the fully reserved deferred position the impact of taxes on our net income for 2011 is immaterial see note 9  to our consolidated financial statements 

we intend to review our conclusion about the appropriate amount of our deferred income tax asset valuation allowance in light of circumstances existing in future periods should we continue to generate earnings at the level generated in 2011 this positive evidence would likely change our conclusion as to the realizability of the deferred tax assets which would result in a reversal of some or all of the valuation allowance given the importance of future annual earnings to this assessment managements consideration would likely extend to late 2012 unless events or changes in circumstances lead to a change in our conclusion before then one potential transaction that could result in adjustment of our valuation allowance is the consummation of our recently announced agreement to acquire nextg see note 20  to the our consolidated financial statements if the nextg acquisition is consummated because of the expected significant deferred tax liabilities that would be recorded in purchase accounting related to the target company we would likely be required to reverse a substantial portion of our existing us federal valuation allowance to earnings as the acquired deferred tax liabilities would serve to offset our deferred tax assets eliminating the need for some or all of the related valuation allowance 

 any future reversal of the valuation allowance would have a favorable impact on our net income but would have no effect on our cash flows while a reversal if any of the valuation allowance would have a positive effect on the companys net income in the period of reversal our net income in periods after such reversal would be reduced as a result of an increase in the provision for income taxes to approximately the statutory rate 

impact of accounting standards issued but not yet adopted and those adopted in 2011   

in october 2009 financial accounting standards board fasb issued guidance that addressed how to recognize revenue for transactions with multiple deliverables this guidance revises the criteria for separating measuring and allocating arrangement consideration to each consideration deliverable which must be estimated if there is not a history of selling the deliverable on a 

standalone basis or thirdparty evidence of selling price the provisions of this guidance were effective for us as of january 1 2011 and were applied prospectively the adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and did not result in a change to the pattern and timing of our revenue recognition 

in september 2011 the fasb issued an amendment to the guidance on goodwill impairment testing the amended guidance permits an entity to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount if it is concluded that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount it is then necessary to perform the twostep goodwill impairment test which is discussed further in note 2  to our consolidated financial statements otherwise the twostep goodwill impairment test is not required we have adopted this amended guidance effective during 2011 see item 7 mda—accounting and reporting matters—critical accounting policies and estimates—accounting for longlived assets—impairment evaluation—goodwill 

nongaap financial measures 

our measurement of profit or loss currently used to evaluate the operating performance of our operating segments is earnings before interest taxes depreciation amortization and accretion as adjusted or adjusted ebitda our definition of adjusted ebitda is set forth in item 7 mda—results of operations—comparison of operating segments    our measure of adjusted ebitda may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies including companies in the tower sector and other similar providers of wireless infrastructure and is not a measure of performance calculated in accordance with gaap adjusted ebitda should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for operating income or loss net income or loss net cash provided by used for operating investing and financing activities or other income statement or cash flow statement data prepared in accordance with gaap 

we believe adjusted ebitda is useful to an investor in evaluating our operating performance because 

 our management uses adjusted ebitda 

 there are material limitations to using a measure such as adjusted ebitda including the difficulty associated with comparing results among more than one company including our competitors and the inability to analyze certain significant items including depreciation and interest expense that directly affect our net income or loss management compensates for these limitations by considering the economic effect of the excluded expense items independently as well as in connection with their analysis of net income loss 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

our primary exposures to market risks are related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates which may adversely affect our results of operations and financial position we seek to manage exposure to changes in interest rates where economically prudent to do so by utilizing fixed rate debt we do not currently hedge against foreign currency exchange risks 

interest rate risk 

our interest rate risk relates primarily to the impact of interest rate movements on the following after giving effect to the wcp acquisition and the january 2012 refinancing 

 potential refinancing of existing debt 

over the next 12 months we have no debt maturities other than principal payments on amortizing debt we do not anticipate the need to access the capital markets to refinance our existing debt until at least 2015 which reflects the impact of refinancings that extended our debt maturities as of december 31 2011 we have no interest rate swaps hedging any refinancings see item 7 mda—liquidity and capital resources—overview   

floating rate debt 

we manage our exposure to market interest rates on our existing debt by controlling the mix of fixed and floating rate debt as of december 31 2011  after giving effect to the january 2012 refinancing and the wcp acquisition we had 16 billion of floating rate debt as a result a hypothetical unfavorable fluctuation in market interest rates on our existing debt of two percentage points over a 12 month period would increase our interest expense by approximately 32 million 

potential future borrowings of incremental debt 

we typically do not hedge our exposure to interest rates on potential future borrowings of incremental debt for a substantial period prior to issuance see item 7 mda—liquidity and capital resources  regarding our shortterm liquidity strategy and note 20  to our consolidated financial statements regarding our january 2012 refinancing including our undrawn revolving credit facility and delayed draw term loan 

the following table provides information about our market risk related to changes in interest rates the future principal payments and weightedaverage interest rates are presented as of december 31 2011  and are after giving effect to the january 2012 refinancing and the wcp acquisition these debt maturities reflect contractual maturity dates and do not consider the impact of the principal payments that will commence following the anticipated repayment dates of certain notes see footnote c see note 6  to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our debt 



   

 

foreign currency risk 

the vast majority of our foreign currency risk is related to the australian dollar which is the functional currency of ccal ccal represented 6  of our consolidated revenues and 4  of our consolidated operating income for 2011  as of december 31 2011  the australian dollar exchange rate had strengthened compared to the us dollar by approximately 12  from the average rate for 2010  see item 7 mda—results of operations—comparison of operating segments 

foreign exchange markets have recently been volatile and we expect foreign exchange markets to continue to be volatile over the near term we believe the risk related to our financial instruments exclusive of intercompany financing deemed a longterm investment denominated in australian dollars is not significant to our financial condition a hypothetical increase or decrease of 25 in australian dollar exchange rate would increase or decrease the fair value of our financial instruments by approximately 8 million

 item 1 business 

overview 

we own operate and lease towers and other wireless infrastructure including distributed antenna system das networks in the us and rooftop installations unless the context otherwise suggests or requires references herein to towers include such other wireless infrastructure our core business is renting space on our towers via longterm contracts in various forms including license sublease and lease agreements collectively contracts our towers can accommodate multiple customers colocation for antennas and other equipment necessary for the transmission of signals for wireless communication devices we seek to increase our site rental revenues by adding more tenants on our towers which we expect to result in significant incremental cash flows due to our relatively fixed tower operating costs 

information concerning our towers as of december 31 2010 is as follows 

 information concerning our customers and site rental contracts as of december 31 2010 is as follows 

  

 to a lesser extent we also provide certain network services relating to our towers primarily consisting of antenna installations and subsequent augmentations as well as the following additional services site acquisition architectural and engineering zoning and permitting other construction and other services related to network development 

strategy 

our strategy is to increase longterm stockholder value by translating anticipated future growth in our core site rental business into growth of our results of operations on a per share basis we believe our strategy is consistent with our mission to deliver the highest level of service to our customers at all times – striving to be their critical partner as we assist them in growing efficient ubiquitous wireless networks the key elements of our strategy are to 

 1 

from our towers by colocating additional tenants on our towers through longterm contracts as our customers deploy and improve their wireless networks we seek to maximize additional new tenant additions or modifications of existing installations collectively new tenant additions through our focus on customer service and deployment speed and by leveraging our webbased proprietary tools due to the relatively fixed nature of the costs to operate our towers which tend to increase at approximately the rate of inflation we expect the increased revenues from rent received from additional colocations and the related subsequent impact from contracted escalations to result in incremental site rental gross margin and growth in our operating cash flows we believe there is considerable additional future demand for our existing towers based on their location and the anticipated growth in the wireless communications industry 

 our longterm strategy is based on our belief that additional demand for our towers will be created by the expected continued growth in the wireless communications industry which is predominately driven by the demand for wireless voice and data services by consumers we believe that additional demand for wireless infrastructure will create future growth opportunities for us we believe that such demand for our towers will continue will result in organic growth of our revenues due to the colocation of additional tenants on our existing towers and will create other growth opportunities for us such as demand for new towers however our results of operations may not always be indicative of the extent of changing demand for our towers in any given period as a result of the application of straightline accounting 

during 2010 consumer demand for wireless data services continued to grow driven by userfriendly wireless devices such as smartphones high speed networks and a robust offering of software applications this growth in data services is in contrast to the slowing growth rate in voice services as the role of wireless devices expands the following is a discussion of the recent growth and our expectations for growth trends in the us wireless communications industry

 2010 highlights and recent developments 

see item 7 mda and our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of developments and activities occurring in 2010  including the refinancing of 35 billion face value of debt and the settlement of all remaining forwardstarting interest rate swaps 

the company 

virtually all of our operations are located in the us and australia we conduct our operations principally through subsidiaries of crown castle operating company ccoc including 1 certain subsidiaries which operate our tower portfolios in the us and 2 a 776 owned subsidiary that operates our australia tower portfolio for more information about our operating segments as well as financial information about the geographic areas in which we operate see note 16 to our consolidated financial statements and item 7 mda   

ccusa 

site rental the core business of ccusa is the renting of antenna space on our towers including colocating tenants on our indoor and outdoor das networks which are located in areas in which zoning restrictions or other barriers may prevent or delay the deployment of a tower and often are attached to public rightofway infrastructure such as utility poles and street lights we predominately rent space to wireless carriers under longterm contracts for their antennas which transmit a variety of signals related to wireless voice and data as a result we believe our towers are integral to our customers network and their ability to serve their customers 

most of our ccusa towers were acquired from the four largest wireless carriers or their predecessors through transactions consummated during the last decade including 1 approximately 10700 towers from global signal inc global signal in 2007 of which approximately 6600 were originally acquired from sprint 2 approximately 4800 towers during 1999 to 2000 from companies now part of verizon wireless 3 approximately 2700 towers during 1999 to 2000 from companies now part of att as well as 4 other smaller acquisitions from companies now part of tmobile and other independent tower operators 

we generally receive monthly rental payments from tenants payable under longterm contracts we have existing master lease agreements with most wireless carriers including verizon wireless att sprint tmobile and clearwire which provide certain terms including economic terms that govern contracts on our towers entered into by such parties during the term of their master lease agreements over the last several years we have negotiated 15year terms for both initial and renewal periods for certain of our customers which often included fixed escalations we continue to endeavor to negotiate with our existing customer base for longer contractual terms which often may contain fixed escalation rates 

our customer contracts have a high renewal rate because of 1 the integral nature of our towers within our customers networks 2 customers cost associated with relocation of their antennas and other equipment to another tower and 3 zoning and other barriers associated with the construction of new towers with limited exceptions the customer contracts may not be terminated in general each customer contract which is renewable will automatically renew at the end of its term unless the customer provides prior notice of its intent not to renew 

see note 15 to our consolidated financial statements for a tabular presentation of the minimum rental cash payments due to us by tenants pursuant to contract agreements without consideration of tenant renewal options 

the average monthly rental payment of a new tenant added to a tower varies based on 1 the different regions in the us 2 aggregate customer volume and 3 the type of signal transmitted by the tenant primarily as a result of the physical size of the antenna installation and related equipment we also routinely receive rental payment increases in connection with contract amendments pursuant to which our customers add additional antennas or other equipment to towers on which they already have equipment pursuant to preexisting contract agreements 

approximately twothirds of our direct site operating expenses consist of ground lease expenses and the remainder includes property taxes repairs and maintenance employee compensation and related benefit costs and utilities our cash operating expenses tend to escalate at approximately the rate of inflation partially offset by reductions in cash ground lease expenses from our purchases of land as a result of the relatively fixed nature of these expenditures the colocation of additional tenants is 

achieved at a low incremental operating cost resulting in high incremental operating cash flows our tower portfolio requires minimal sustaining capital expenditures including tower maintenance and other nondiscretionary capital expenditures and are typically less than 2 of site rental revenues 

we have an agreement to provide certain management construction and acquisition services for a third party as to certain tower opportunities in the us with an initial period through march 2011 the arrangement was entered into to permit us to maintain our construction and acquisition capabilities and expertise and further our good relationships with certain major customers with limited capital commitments and expenditures as to such towers 

network services to a lesser extent we also offer wireless communication companies and their agents certain network services relating to our towers for 2010 approximately 71 of network services and other revenues related to antenna installations and subsequent augmentation collectively installation services and the remainder related to the following additional services site acquisition architectural and engineering zoning and permitting other construction and other services related to network development we do not always provide the installation services on our towers as the customer may obtain a third party to complete these services as reflected in our quarterly market share for installation services on our towers which has ranged between onequarter to twothirds over the last two years see also  —competition  below we have grown our network services business over the last several years as a result of our focus on customer service and increasing our market share for installation services on our towers we have the capability and expertise to install with the assistance of our network of subcontractors equipment and antenna systems for our customers these activities are typically nonrecurring and highly competitive with a number of local competitors in most markets nearly all of our antenna installation services are billed on a costplus profit basis 

customers we work extensively with large national wireless carriers and in general our customers are primarily comprised of providers of wireless voice and data services who operate national or regional networks the following table summarizes the net revenues from our four largest customers expressed as a percentage of ccusas and our consolidated revenues for 2010  see item 1a risk factors 

  



in addition to our four largest customers new tenant additions for 2010 were derived from customers offering emerging wireless technologies such as those offering wireless data only technologies and to a lesser extent national wireless carriers other than those mentioned in the table above such as those offering flat rate calling plans new entrants in the wireless industry are emerging as new technologies become available including clearwire a provider of wimax wireless mobile data services 

sales and marketing the ccusa sales organization markets our towers within the wireless communications industry with the objectives of renting space on existing towers and on new towers prior to construction as well as obtaining network services related to our towers we seek to become the critical partner and preferred independent tower provider for our customers and increase customer satisfaction relative to our peers by leveraging our 1 technological tools 2 process centric approach and 3 customer relationships 

we use public and proprietary databases to develop targeted marketing programs focused on carrier network expansions including das networks and any related network services we attempt to match specific towers in our portfolio with potential new site demand by obtaining and analyzing information including our customers existing antenna locations tenant contracts marketing strategies capital spend plans deployment status and actual wireless carrier signal strength measurements taken in the field we have developed a webbased tool that stores key tower information above and beyond normal property management information including data on actual customer signal strength demographics site readiness and competitive structures in addition the webbased tool assists us in estimating potential demand for our towers with greater speed and accuracy we believe these and other tools we have developed assist our customers in their site selection and deployment of their wireless networks and provide us with an opportunity to have proactive discussions with them regarding their wireless infrastructure deployment plans and the timing and location of their demand for our towers a key aspect to our sales and marketing strategy is a continued emphasis on our processcentric approach to reduce cycle time related to new leasing and amendments which helps provide our customers with faster deployment of their networks 

a team of national account directors maintains our relationships with our largest customers these directors work to develop 

tower leasing and network service opportunities as well as to ensure that customers tower needs are efficiently translated into new leases on our towers sales personnel in our area offices develop and maintain local relationships with our customers that are expanding their networks entering new markets bringing new technologies to market or requiring maintenance or addon business in addition to our fulltime sales and marketing staff a number of senior managers and officers spend a significant portion of their time on sales and marketing activities and call on existing and prospective customers 

competition ccusa competes with 1 other independent tower owners which also provide site rental and network services 2 wireless carriers which build own and operate their own tower networks and lease space to other wireless communication companies and 3 owners of alternative facilities including rooftops water towers broadcast towers das networks and utility poles some of the larger independent tower companies with which ccusa competes in the us include american tower corporation sba communications corporation global tower partners and towerco wireless carriers that own and operate their own tower networks generally are substantially larger and have greater financial resources than we have we believe that tower location and capacity deployment speed quality of service and price have been and will continue to be the most significant competitive factors affecting the leasing of a tower 

competitors in the network services business include site acquisition consultants zoning consultants real estate firms rightofway consulting firms construction companies tower owners and managers radio frequency engineering consultants telecommunications equipment vendors who can provide turnkey site development services through multiple subcontractors and our customers internal staffs we believe that our customers base their decisions on the outsourcing of network services on criteria such as a companys experience track record local reputation price and time for completion of a project 

ccal 

our primary business in australia is the renting of antenna space on towers to our customers ccal is owned 776 by us and 224 by permanent nominees aust ltd acting on behalf of a group of professional and private investors led by todd capital limited ccal is the largest independent tower operator in australia as of december 31 2010  ccal had approximately 1600 towers with 57 of such towers located in the six major metropolitan areas including sydney melbourne brisbane perth adelaide and the australian capital territory the majority of ccals towers were acquired from optus in 2000 and vodafone in 2001 ccal also provides a range of services including site maintenance and property management services for towers owned by third parties 

for 2010  ccal comprised 5 of our consolidated net revenues ccals principal customers are telstra optus and vha which collectively accounted for approximately 93 of ccals 2010 revenues in june 2009 vodafone and hutchison merged their australian operations in a joint venture named vha pty ltd with the intention to market primarily under the name vodafone 

in australia ccal competes with wireless carriers which own and operate their own tower networks service companies that provide site maintenance and property management services and other site owners such as broadcasters and building owners the other significant tower owners in australia are broadcast australia an independent operator of broadcast towers and telstra and optus wireless carriers we believe that tower location capacity quality of service deployment speed and price within a geographic market are the most significant competitive factors affecting the leasing of a tower 

employees 

at january 31 2011 we employed approximately 1200 people worldwide including approximately 1100 in the us we are not a party to any collective bargaining agreements we have not experienced any strikes or work stoppages and management believes that our employee relations are satisfactory 

regulatory and environmental matters 

to date we have not incurred any material fines or penalties or experienced any material adverse effects to our business as a result of any domestic or international regulations the summary below is based on regulations currently in effect and such regulations are subject to review and modification by the applicable governmental authority from time to time if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations we may be fined or even lose our rights to conduct some of our business 

united states 

we are required to comply with a variety of federal state and local regulations and laws in the us including the fcc and federal aviation administration faa regulations and those discussed under —environmental below 

federal regulations both the fcc and the faa regulate towers used for wireless communications radio and television broadcasting such regulations control the siting lighting and marking of towers and may depending on the characteristics of particular towers require the registration of tower facilities with the fcc and the issuance of determinations confirming no hazard 

to air traffic wireless communications devices operating on towers are separately regulated and independently licensed based upon the particular frequency used in addition the fcc and the faa have developed standards to consider proposals for new or modified tower and antenna structures based upon the height and location including proximity to airports proposals to construct or to modify existing tower and antenna structures above certain heights are reviewed by the faa to ensure the structure will not present a hazard to aviation which determination may be conditioned upon compliance with lighting and marking requirements the fcc requires its licensees to operate communications devices only on towers that comply with faa rules and are registered with the fcc if required by its regulations where tower lighting is required by faa regulation tower owners bear the responsibility of notifying the faa of any tower lighting outage and ensuring the timely restoration of such outages failure to comply with the applicable requirements may lead to civil penalties 

local regulations the us telecommunications act of 1996 amended the communications act of 1934 to preserve state and local zoning authorities jurisdiction over the siting of communications towers the law however limits local zoning authority by prohibiting actions by local authorities that discriminate between different service providers of wireless services or ban altogether the provision of wireless services additionally the law prohibits state and local restrictions based on the environmental effects of radio frequency emissions to the extent the facilities comply with fcc regulations 

local regulations include city and other local ordinances including subdivision and zoning ordinances approvals for construction modification and removal of towers and restrictive covenants imposed by community developers these regulations vary greatly but typically require us to obtain approval from local officials prior to tower construction local zoning authorities may render decisions that prevent the construction or modification of towers or place conditions on such construction or modifications that are responsive to community residents concerns regarding the height visibility and other characteristics of the towers to expedite the deployment of wireless networks the fcc issued a declaratory ruling in november 2009 establishing timeframes for the review of applications by local and state governments of 90 days for colocations and 150 days for new tower construction if a jurisdiction fails to act within these timeframes the applicant may file a claim for relief in court notwithstanding this declaratory ruling decisions of local zoning authorities may also adversely affect the timing and cost of tower construction and modification 

environmental we are required to comply with a variety of federal state and local environmental laws and regulations protecting environmental quality including air and water quality and wildlife protection to date we have not incurred any material fines or penalties or experienced any material adverse effects to our business as a result of any domestic or international environmental regulations or matters see item 1a risk factors 

the construction of new towers and in some cases the modification of existing towers in the us may be subject to environmental review under the national environmental policy act of 1969 as amended nepa which requires federal agencies to evaluate the environmental impact of major federal actions the fcc has promulgated regulations implementing nepa which require applicants to investigate the potential environmental impact of the proposed tower construction should the proposed tower construction present a significant environmental impact the fcc must prepare an environmental impact statement subject to public comment if the proposed construction or modification of a tower may have a significant impact on the environment the fccs approval of the construction or modification could be significantly delayed 

our operations are subject to federal state and local laws and regulations relating to the management use storage disposal emission and remediation of and exposure to hazardous and nonhazardous substances materials and wastes as an owner lessee or operator of real property we are subject to certain environmental laws that impose strict jointandseveral liability for the cleanup of onsite or offsite contamination relating to existing or historical operations and we could also be subject to personal injury or property damage claims relating to such contamination in general our customer contracts prohibit our customers from using or storing any hazardous substances on our tower sites in violation of applicable environmental laws and require our customers to provide notice of certain environmental conditions caused by them 

as licensees and tower owners we are also subject to regulations and guidelines that impose a variety of operational requirements relating to radio frequency emissions as employers we are subject to occupational safety and health administration and similar occupational health and safety legislation in australia and similar guidelines regarding employee protection from radio frequency exposure the potential connection between radio frequency emissions and certain negative health effects including some forms of cancer has been the subject of substantial study by the scientific community in recent years 

we have compliance programs and monitoring projects to help assure that we are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws nevertheless there can be no assurance that the costs of compliance with existing or future environmental laws will not have a material adverse effect on us 

other regulations we hold through certain of our subsidiaries certain licenses for radio transmission facilities granted by the fcc including licenses for common carrier microwave service commercial and private mobile radio service specialized mobile radio and paging service which are subject to additional regulation by the fcc our fcc license relating to our 16701675 

mhz us nationwide spectrum license spectrum contains certain conditions related to the services that may be provided thereunder the technical equipment used in connection therewith and the circumstances under which it may be renewed in 2007 after receiving fcc approval we entered into a longterm lease of the spectrum with an initial term through 2013 

australia 

federal regulations carrier licenses and nominated carrier declarations issued under the australian telecommunications act 1997 authorize the use of network units for the supply of telecommunications services to the public the definition of “network units” includes line links and base stations used for wireless voice services but does not include tower infrastructure accordingly ccal as a tower owner and operator does not require a carrier license under the australian telecommunications act 1997 similarly because ccal does not own any transmitters or spectrum it does not currently require any apparatus or spectrum licenses issued under the australian radiocommunications act 1992 

carriers have a statutory obligation to provide other carriers with access to towers and if there is a dispute including a pricing dispute the matter may be referred to the australian competition and consumer commission for resolution as a noncarrier ccal is not subject to this requirement and our customers negotiate site access on a commercial basis 

while the australian telecommunications act 1997 grants certain exemptions from planning laws for the installation of low impact facilities newly constructed towers are expressly excluded from the definition of low impact facilities accordingly in connection with the construction of towers ccal is subject to state and local planning laws that vary on a site by site basis typically requiring us to obtain approval from local offices prior to tower construction subject to certain exceptions structural enhancements may be undertaken on behalf of a carrier without state and local planning approval under the general maintenance power under the australian telecommunications act 1997 although these enhancements may be subject to state and local planning laws if ccal is unable to obtain carrier cooperation to use such power for a limited number of towers ccal is also required to install aircraft warning lighting in compliance with federal aviation regulations in australia a carrier may arguably be able to utilize the maintenance power under the australian telecommunications act 1997 to remain as a tenant on a tower after the expiration of a site license or sublease however ccals customer access agreements generally limit the ability of customers to do this and even if a carrier did utilize this power the carrier would be required to pay for ccals financial loss which would roughly equal the site rental revenues that would have otherwise been payable 

local regulations in australia there are various local state and territory laws and regulations which relate to among other things town planning and zoning restrictions standards and approvals for the design construction or alteration of a structure or facility and environmental regulations as in the us these laws vary greatly but typically require tower owners to obtain approval from governmental bodies prior to tower construction and to comply with environmental laws on an ongoing basis 

  




 item 1a risk factors 

you should carefully consider all of the risks described below as well as the other information contained in this document when evaluating your investment in our securities 

our business depends on the demand for wireless communications and towers and we may be adversely affected by any slowdown in such demand 

demand for our towers depends on the demand for antenna space from our customers which in turn depends on the demand for wireless voice and data services by their customers the willingness of our customers to utilize our infrastructure or renew or extend existing contracts on our towers is affected by numerous factors including 

 7 

 a slowdown in demand for wireless communications or our towers may negatively impact our growth or otherwise have a material adverse effect on us over the last several years new entrants in the marketplace such as those providing wireless data technologies have accounted for a significant portion of our new tenant additions our expectations for future demand for our towers is based in part on new entrants into the wireless communications industry with unproven business models the success of new entrants can be influenced by numerous factors including the items described above particularly the availability and cost of capital and the success of their business models if our customers or potential customers are unable to raise adequate capital to fund their business plans as a result of disruptions in the financial and credit markets or otherwise they may reduce their spending which could adversely affect our anticipated growth and the demand for our towers and network services 

a substantial portion of our revenues is derived from a small number of customers and the loss consolidation or financial instability of or network sharing among any of our limited number of customers may materially decrease revenues and reduce demand for our towers and network services 

for 2010 approximately 73 of our consolidated revenues was derived from att verizon wireless sprint and tmobile which represented 21  21  20 and 11  respectively of our consolidated net revenues the loss of any one of our large customers as a result of bankruptcy insolvency consolidation network sharing roaming joint development resale agreements by our customers merger with other customers of ours or otherwise may result in 1 a material decrease in our revenues 2 uncollectible account receivables 3 an impairment of our deferred site rental receivables towers assets site rental contracts and customer relationships intangible assets and 4 other adverse effects to our business we cannot guarantee that contracts with our major customers will not be terminated or that these customers will renew their contracts with us see also item 1 business—the company 

consolidation among our customers will likely result in duplicate or overlapping parts of networks which may result in a reduction of cell sites and impact revenues from our towers in addition consolidation may result in a reduction in such customers future capital expenditures in the aggregate because their expansion plans may be similar for example verizon wireless acquired alltel in 2009 in addition sprint merged with nextel in august 2005 resulting in their use of two separate wireless technologies during 2010 sprint announced multiyear network plans to consolidate their multiple network technologies including the elimination of their narrowband pushtotalk network referred to as iden which is scheduled to be phased out over a period of time beginning in 2013 these plans by sprint may result in their not renewing certain contracts with us any industry consolidation could decrease the demand for our towers which in turn may result in a reduction in our revenues and cash flows 

our substantial level of indebtedness could adversely affect our ability to react to changes in our business and the terms of our debt instruments limit our ability to take a number of actions that our management might otherwise believe to be in our best interests in addition if we fail to comply with our covenants our debt could be accelerated 

as a result of our substantial indebtedness 

 currently we have debt instruments in place that limit in certain circumstances our ability to incur indebtedness pay dividends create liens sell assets and engage in certain mergers and acquisitions our subsidiaries under their debt instruments are also required to maintain specific financial ratios our ability to comply with the financial ratio covenants under these instruments and to satisfy our debt obligations will depend on our future operating performance if we fail to comply with the debt restrictions we will be in default under those instruments which would cause the maturity of a substantial portion of our longterm indebtedness to be accelerated if our operating subsidiaries were to default on the debt the trustee could seek to foreclose the collateral securing the debt in which case we could lose the towers and the revenues associated with the towers see also item 7 mda—liquidity and capital resources—debt covenants 

ccic and ccoc are holding companies that conduct all of their operations through their subsidiaries accordingly ccics 

and ccocs respective sources of cash to pay interest and principal on their outstanding indebtedness and preferred stock are distributions relating to their respective ownership interests in their subsidiaries from the net earnings and cash flows generated by such subsidiaries or from proceeds of debt or equity offerings earnings and cash flows generated by their subsidiaries are first applied by such subsidiaries in conducting their operations including the service of their respective debt obligations after which any excess cash flows generally may be paid to a holding company in the absence of any special conditions such as a continuing event of default however their subsidiaries are legally distinct from the holding companies and unless they guarantee such debt have no obligation to pay amounts due on their debt or to make funds available to us for such payment 

we have a substantial amount of indebtedness in the event we do not repay or refinance such indebtedness we could face substantial liquidity issues and might be required to issue equity securities or securities convertible into equity securities or sell some of our assets to meet our debt payment obligations 

we have a substantial amount of indebtedness approximately 68 billion as of december 31 2010  which we will need to refinance or repay see item 7 mda—liquidity and capital resources for a tabular presentation of our contractual debt maturities we are also required to redeem all outstanding shares of our 625 convertible preferred stock in august 2012 for approximately 3181 million  plus any unpaid dividends on that preferred stock there can be no assurances we will be able to refinance our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or terms including with respect to interest rates as favorable as our current debt and preferred stock or at all 

beginning in 2008 the global economy entered a recession and the credit markets underwent a period of substantial volatility and disruption although economic conditions and credit markets have improved during 2009 and 2010 uncertainty and weakness continues any renewed financial turmoil worsening credit environment economic weakness and uncertainty could impact the availability and cost of debt financing including with respect to any refinancing of the obligations described above 

if we are unable to refinance or renegotiate our debt we cannot guarantee that we will be able to generate enough cash flows from operations or that we will be able to obtain enough capital to service our debt pay our obligations under our convertible preferred stock or fund our planned capital expenditures in such an event we could face substantial liquidity issues and might be required to issue equity securities or securities convertible into equity securities or sell some of our assets to meet our debt payment obligations failure to refinance indebtedness when required could result in a default under such indebtedness assuming we meet certain financial ratios we have the ability under our debt instruments to incur additional indebtedness and any additional indebtedness we incur could exacerbate the risks described above 

sales or issuances of a substantial number of shares of our common stock may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

future sales or issuances of a substantial number of shares of our common stock or other equity related securities may adversely affect the market price of our common stock as of february 5 2011 we had 2909 million shares of common stock outstanding and we reserved 1 89 million shares of common stock for future issuance under our various stock compensation plans and 2 86 million shares of common stock for the conversion of our outstanding convertible preferred stock 

in addition a small number of stockholders own a significant percentage of our outstanding common stock if any one of these stockholders or any group of our stockholders sells a large quantity of shares of our common stock or the public market perceives that existing stockholders might sell a large quantity of shares of our common stock the market price of our common stock may significantly decline 

a wireless communications industry slowdown or a reduction in carrier network investment may materially and adversely affect our business including reducing demand for our towers and network services 

historically the amount of our customers network investment is cyclical and has varied based upon the various matters described in these risk factors changes in carrier network investment typically impact the demand for our towers as a result changes in carrier plans such as delays in the implementation of new systems new technologies or plans to expand coverage or capacity may reduce demand for our towers furthermore the wireless communication industry could experience a slow down or slowing growth rates as a result of numerous factors including a reduction in consumer demand for wireless services and general economic conditions there can be no assurances that the weakness and uncertainty in the current economic environment will not adversely impact the wireless communications industry which may materially and adversely affect our business including by reducing demand for our towers and network services in addition such a slowdown may increase competition for site rental customers and network services a wireless communications industry slowdown or a reduction in carrier network investment may materially and adversely affect our business 

as a result of competition in our industry including from some competitors with significantly more resources or less debt than we have we may find it more difficult to achieve favorable rental rates on our new or renewing customer contracts 

our growth is dependent on entering into new customer contracts as well as renewing or reletting customer contracts when existing customer contracts terminate we face competition for site rental customers from various sources including 

 wireless carriers that own and operate their own tower portfolios are generally substantially larger and have greater financial resources than we have competition in our industry may make it more difficult for us to attract new customers maintain or increase our gross margins or maintain or increase our market share 

new technologies may significantly reduce demand for our towers and negatively impact our revenues 

improvements in the efficiency of wireless networks could reduce the demand for our towers for example signal combining technologies that permit one antenna to service multiple frequencies and thereby multiple customers may reduce the need for our towers in addition other technologies such as wifi femtocells picocells satellite transmission systems such as low earth orbiting and das networks may in the future serve as substitutes for or alternatives to leasing that might otherwise be anticipated or expected on towers had such technologies not existed any significant reduction in tower leasing demand resulting from the previously mentioned technologies or other technologies may negatively impact our revenues or otherwise have a material adverse effect on us 

new wireless technologies may not deploy or be adopted by customers as rapidly or in the manner projected 

there can be no assurances that new wireless services and technologies such as 4g will be introduced or deployed as rapidly or in the manner projected by the wireless or broadcast industries in addition demand and customer adoption rates for such new technologies may be lower or slower than anticipated for numerous reasons as a result growth opportunities and demand for our towers as a result of such technologies may not be realized at the times or to the extent anticipated 

if we fail to retain rights to our towers including the land under our towers our business may be adversely affected 

our property interests relating to the land on which our towers reside consist primarily of leasehold and subleasehold interests fee interests easements licenses and rightsofway a loss of these interests may interfere with our ability to conduct our business and generate revenues for various reasons we may not always have the ability to access analyze and verify all information regarding titles and other issues prior to completing an acquisition of towers further we may not be able to renew ground leases on commercially viable terms our ability to retain rights to the land on which our towers reside depends on our ability to purchase such land or to renegotiate and extend the terms of the leases relating to such land approximately 9 of our site rental gross margins for the year ended december 31 2010 are derived from towers where the leases for the land under such towers have final expiration dates of less than ten years if we are unable to retain rights to the land on which our towers reside our business may be adversely affected 

approximately 6500 of our towers are leased or operated for an initial period of 32 years through may 2037 under master leases and subleases with sprint sprint towers we have the option to purchase in 2037 all but not less than all of the sprint towers from sprint for approximately 23 billion we may not have the required available capital to exercise our right to purchase these towers at the end of the applicable period even if we do have available capital we may choose not to exercise our right to purchase the sprint towers for business or other reasons in the event that we do not exercise these purchase rights or are otherwise unable to acquire an interest that would allow us to continue to operate these towers after the applicable period we will lose the cash flows derived from such towers which may have a material adverse effect on our business in the event that we decide to exercise these purchase rights the benefits of the acquisition of the sprint towers may not exceed the costs which could adversely affect our business 

our network services business has historically experienced significant volatility in demand which reduces the predictability of our results 

the operating results of our network services business for any particular period may vary significantly and should not necessarily be considered indicative of longerterm results for this activity our network services business may be adversely impacted by various factors including competition economic weakness and uncertainty our market share and changes in the type and volume of work performed 

if we fail to comply with laws or regulations which regulate our business and which may change at any time we may be fined 

or even lose our right to conduct some of our business 

a variety of federal state local and foreign laws and regulations apply to our business including those discussed in item 1 business failure to comply with applicable requirements may lead to civil penalties or require us to assume indemnification obligations or breach contractual provisions we cannot guarantee that existing or future laws or regulations including state and local tax laws will not adversely affect our business increase delays or result in additional costs these factors may have a material adverse effect on us 

if radio frequency emissions from wireless handsets or equipment on our towers are demonstrated to cause negative health effects potential future claims could adversely affect our operations costs and revenues 

the potential connection between radio frequency emissions and certain negative health effects including some forms of cancer has been the subject of substantial study by the scientific community in recent years we cannot guarantee that claims relating to radio frequency emissions will not arise in the future or that the results of such studies will not be adverse to us 

public perception of possible health risks associated with cellular and other wireless communications may slow or diminish the growth of wireless companies which may in turn slow or diminish our growth in particular negative public perception of and regulations regarding these perceived health risks may slow or diminish the market acceptance of wireless communications services if a connection between radio emissions and possible negative health effects were established our operations costs and revenues may be materially and adversely affected we currently do not maintain any significant insurance with respect to these matters 

certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation bylaws and operative agreements and domestic and international competition laws may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us or for us to acquire control of a third party even if such a change in control would be beneficial to our stockholders 

we have a number of antitakeover devices in place that will hinder takeover attempts and may reduce the market value of our common stock our antitakeover provisions include 

 our bylaws permit special meetings of the stockholders to be called only upon the request of our chief executive officer or a majority of the board of directors and deny stockholders the ability to call such meetings such provisions as well as the provisions of section 203 of the delaware general corporation law may impede a merger consolidation takeover or other business combination or discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us 

in addition domestic and international competition laws may prevent or discourage us from acquiring towers or tower networks in certain geographical areas or impede a merger consolidation takeover or other business combination or discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us 

we may be adversely effected by exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates relating to our operations in australia 

our australian operations expose us to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates for 2010  approximately 5 of our consolidated net revenues were denominated in australian dollars over the past five years the australian dollar has strengthened by 29 against the us dollar we have not historically engaged in significant hedging activities relating to our australian operations and we may suffer future losses as a result of changes in currency exchange rates

 item 2 properties 

offices 

our principal corporate headquarters is owned and located in houston texas in the us ccusa owns or leases area offices located in 1 canonsburg pennsylvania 2 charlotte north carolina 3 alpharetta georgia and 4 phoenix arizona the principal responsibilities of these area offices are to manage the renting of tower space on a local basis maintain the towers already located in the area and service our customers in the area in addition general and administrative functions are also performed at the canonsburg pennsylvania location in addition we lease additional smaller district offices which report to the area offices in locations with high tower concentrations in australia we lease an office in sydney australia 

towers 

towers are vertical metal structures generally ranging in height from 50 to 500 feet in addition wireless communications equipment may also be placed on building rooftops and other structures towers are generally located on tracts of land of up to five acres these tracts of land support the towers equipment shelters and where applicable guyed wires to stabilize the structure 

see item 1 business—overview for information regarding our tower portfolio including with respect to our real property interests and for a discussion of the location of our towers in the us and australia including the percentage of our us towers in the top 50 and 100 btas see item 7 mda—liquidity and capital resources—contractual cash obligations for a tabular presentation of the remaining terms to final expiration of the leases for the land which we do not own and on which our towers are located as of december 31 2010  

approximately 15700 towers 66 of our total and the cash flows from these towers effectively secure 47 billion of our debt governing documents relating to another approximately 4900 towers prevent liens from being granted on those towers without approval of a subsidiary of verizon however distributions paid from the entities that own those towers also service our tower revenue notes see note 6 to our consolidated financial statements 

approximately 6500 of our towers are leased or operated for an initial period of 32 years through may 2037 under master leases and subleases with sprint we have the option to purchase in 2037 all but not less than all of these sprint towers from sprint for approximately 23 billion 

substantially all of our towers can accommodate another tenant either as currently constructed or with appropriate modifications to the tower additionally if so inclined as a result of a customer request for a new colocation or amendment of an existing installation we could generally replace an existing tower with another tower in its place providing additional capacity subject to certain restrictions as of december 31 2010  the average number of tenants per tower is approximately 29 on our towers the following is a summary of the number of existing tenants per tower as of december 31 2010 see item 7 mda—accounting and reporting matters—critical accounting policies and estimates for a discussion of our impairment evaluation and our towers with no tenants

comparison of operating segments 

our reportable operating segments for 2010 are 1 ccusa primarily consisting of our us tower operations and 2 ccal our australian tower operations our financial results are reported to management and the board of directors in this manner 

see note 16 to our consolidated financial statements for segment results and a reconciliation of net income loss to adjusted ebitda defined below 

our measurement of profit or loss currently used to evaluate our operating performance and operating segments is earnings before interest taxes depreciation amortization and accretion as adjusted adjusted ebitda our measure of adjusted ebitda may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies including companies in the tower sector and is not a measure of performance calculated in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap

ccusa— 2010 and 2009  net revenues for 2010 increased by 1751 million  or 11  from 2009  this increase in net revenues resulted from an increase in site rental revenues of 1416 million  or 10  for the same periods this increase in site rental revenues was impacted by the following items inclusive of straightline accounting in no particular order new tenant additions across our entire portfolio renewals or extensions of customer contracts escalations and cancellations of customer contracts see item 7 mda—accounting and reporting matters—critical accounting policies and estimates for a further discussion of our revenue recognition policies tenant additions were influenced by the previously mentioned growth in the wireless communications industry we amended a site rental contract with one of our four largest customers during 2010 to provide the customer with the ability to add equipment to its existing antennas on our towers without the need to pay additional rent on individual amendments at each tower with limited exceptions in exchange for an increase in rent on the customers existing contracts during 2010 we continued to derive a large portion of our site rental revenues from the four largest wireless carriers in the us although a significant portion of our new tenant additions were from customers offering emerging wireless services such as those offering wireless data only technologies including clearwire a provider of wireless mobile internet services see also item 1 business—the company—ccusa 

site rental gross margins for 2010 increased by 1373 million  or 13  from 2009  the increase in the site rental gross margins was related to the previously mentioned 10 increase in site rental revenues site rental gross margins for 2010 increased primarily as a result of the high incremental margins associated with tenant additions given the relatively fixed costs to operate a tower the 1373 million incremental margin represents 97 of the related increase in site rental revenues 

network services and other revenues for 2010 increased by 336 million  or 25  from 2009  and the related gross margin increased by 143 million  or 31  from 2009  our network services business is of a variable nature as these revenues are not under longterm contracts the increase in our network services and other revenues reflect our increased market share as well as the general volatility in the volume and mix of such work we were able to achieve this growth in revenues while modestly expanding our related gross margin 

general and administrative expenses for 2010 increased by 72 million  or 5  from 2009 but decreased to 8 of net revenues from 9  general and administrative expenses are inclusive of stockbased compensation charges which increased by 68 million from 2009 to 2010  as discussed further in note 12 to our consolidated financial statements the increase in stockbased compensation was driven by the furthered emphasis on the longterm incentive compensation component of total compensation for senior management which we believe further aligns compensation with stockholder value typically our general and administrative expenses do not significantly increase as a result of the colocation of additional tenants on our towers 

adjusted ebitda for 2010 increased by 1516 million  or 16  from 2009  adjusted ebitda was positively impacted by the growth in our site rental and services businesses including the high incremental site rental margin on the new tenant additions 

depreciation amortization and accretion for 2010 increased by 114 million  or 2  from 2009  the small increase is consistent with the movement in our fixed assets and intangible assets which did not materially change between 2009 and 2010  

during 2009 and 2010  we refinanced the vast majority of our debt in order to extend and ladder the maturities of our debt portfolio this refinancing activity included purchasing and early retiring certain of our debt resulting in a net loss of 1384 million for 2010  inclusive of make whole payments the increase in interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs of 449 million  or 10  in 2010 resulted predominately from 1 a 354 million increase in the amortization of interest rate swaps primarily related to the loss on the swaps hedging the refinancing of the 2005 tower revenue notes and the 2006 tower revenue notes and 2 the net impact of our various refinancings during 2010  we recorded losses on interest rate swaps of 2864 million  which predominately resulted from an increase in the liability due to changes in the libor yield curve for those swaps not subject to hedge accounting as of december 31 2010 all of our forwardstarting interest rate swaps are settled for a further discussion of the debt refinancings and the interest rate swaps see notes 6 and 7 to our consolidated financial statements item 7 mda—liquidity and capital resources and item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk   

benefit provision for income taxes for 2010 was a benefit of 288 million compared to a benefit of 777 million for 2009  as further discussed in note 9 to our consolidated financial statements we were limited in our ability to recognize federal tax benefits on our losses during 2010 except for 198 million of federal tax benefits recorded predominately as a result of discrete events including acquisitions as of december 31 2010  we are unable to recognize additional federal tax benefits in future periods unless discrete events allow us to record additional deferred tax liabilities tax benefits for 2009 predominately reflect our recognition of federal tax benefits on our losses and a reversal of 206 million of state tax valuation allowance 

net income loss attributable to ccic stockholders for 2010 was a loss of 3102 million  inclusive of 1 net losses from interest rate swaps of 2864 million and 2 net losses from repayments and purchases and early retirement of debt of 1384 million  net income loss attributable to ccic stockholders for 2009 was a loss of 1154 million  inclusive of 1 net losses from repayments and purchases and early retirement of debt of 911 million and 2 net losses from interest rate swaps of 930 million the increase in net loss was predominately due to 1 the previously mentioned charges and benefits and 2 the previously mentioned increase in interest expense of 449 million  partially offset by 3 growth in our site rental and service businesses 

ccal— 2010 and 2009  the increases and decreases between 2010 and 2009 are inclusive of exchange rate fluctuations the average exchange rate of australian dollars to us dollars for 2010 was approximately 092  an increase of 16 from approximately 079 for the same period in the prior year see item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

total net revenues for 2010 increased by 181 million  or 21  from 2009  site rental revenues for 2010 increased by 160 million  or 21  from 2009  the increase in the exchange rate positively impacted net revenues and site rental revenues by approximately 143 million and 129 million  respectively and accounted for an increase of 17 in both net revenues and site rental revenues for 2010 from 2009  site rental revenues were also impacted by various other factors inclusive of straightline accounting including in no particular order new tenant additions on our towers renewals of customer contracts escalations and cancellations of customer contracts 

site rental gross margins increased by 97 million  or 18  for 2010 from 536 million and adjusted ebitda for 2010 increased by 70 million  or 15  from 2009  the increase in the site rental gross margin and adjusted ebitda were predominately due to exchange rate fluctuations 

net income loss attributable to ccic stockholders for 2010 was a net loss of 07 million  compared to net income of 11 

million for 2009  the change from net income to net loss was predominately due to the following exclusive of the impact from exchange rate fluctuations 1 an increase in interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs the majority of which was due to an increase in the variable interest rate of our intercompany debt 2 an increase in general and administrative expenses due to an increase in stockbased compensation and 3 lower depreciation expense for 2010 as a result of recording depreciation expense for towers that were acquired in 2008 with short useful lives for accounting purposes driven by the short term of the underlying ground lease 

ccusa— 2009 and 2008  net revenues for 2009 increased by 1630 million  or 11  from 2008  this increase in net revenues resulted from an increase in site rental revenues of 1419 million  or 11  for the same periods this increase in site rental revenues was impacted by the following items inclusive of straightline accounting in no particular order new tenant additions across our entire portfolio renewals or extensions of customer contracts escalations and cancellations of customer contracts see item 7 mda—accounting and reporting matters—critical accounting policies and estimates for a further discussion of our revenue recognition policies tenant additions were influenced by the previously mentioned growth in the wireless communications industry although we continued to derive a large portion of our site rental revenues from the four largest wireless carriers in the us a significant portion of our new tenant additions were from national wireless carriers other than the four largest wireless carriers such as those offering flat rate calling plans and customers offering emerging wireless technologies such as wireless data only technologies including clearwire a provider of wireless mobile internet services 

site rental gross margins for 2009 increased by 1413 million or 16 from 2008  the increase in site rental gross margins was related to the previously mentioned 11 increase in site rental revenues site rental gross margins increased primarily as a result of the high incremental margins associated with tenant additions given the relatively fixed costs to operate a tower the 1413 million incremental margin represents 100 of the related increase in site rental revenues 

network services and other revenues for 2009 increased by 212 million  or 19  from 2008  and the related gross margin increased by 101 million or 28 from 2008 the increase in network services and other revenues and the related gross margin reflects 1 the volatility and variable nature of the network services business as these revenues are not under longterm contract 2 as well as an increase in our market share for installations on our towers driven partially by our focus on delivering customer service and our emphasis on execution and expanding market share in the service business 

general and administrative expenses for 2009 increased by 77 million  or 6  from 2008  general and administrative expenses are inclusive of stockbased compensation charges which increased by 33 million from 2008 to 2009 as discussed further in note 12 to our consolidated financial statements in addition to stockbased compensation the increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to the increase in salary and employee benefits including an increase in the annual bonus accrual due to 2009 performance and other nonrecurring expenses partially offset by the realization of certain cost management initiatives general and administrative expenses were 9 of net revenues for both 2009 and 2008 typically our general and administrative expenses do not significantly increase as a result of the colocation of additional tenants on our towers 

adjusted ebitda for 2009 increased by 1470 million or 18 from 2008  adjusted ebitda was positively impacted by the growth in our site rental business including the high incremental margin on the tenant additions 

depreciation amortization and accretion for 2009 increased by 32 million  or less than 1 from 2008  the small increase is consistent with the movement in our fixed assets and intangible assets which did not materially change between 2008 and 2009 

during 2009  we repaid or purchased 23 billion face value of debt using cash from our issuances of debt in order to extend the maturities of our debt portfolio as a result of purchasing and early retiring certain of our debt we incurred a net loss of 911 million for 2009 inclusive of make whole payments the increase in interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs of 926 million  or 26  in 2009 resulted predominately from our total debt increasing by 4626 million and the impact of completing the refinancings at a higher weightedaverage cost of debt the refinancing of the 2006 mortgage loan did not qualify for hedge accounting as the actual refinancing was not consistent with that anticipated as part of hedge accounting which resulted in discontinuing hedge accounting and reclassifying 1329 million from accumulated other comprehensive income aoci to earnings during 2009 this loss was partially offset by gains on interest rate swaps that resulted from a decrease in the liability for those swaps not subject to hedge accounting for a further discussion of the debt refinancings and the interest rate swaps see notes 6 and 7 to our consolidated financial statements item 7 mda—liquidity and capital resources and item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

benefit provision for income taxes for 2009 was a benefit of 777 million compared to 1066 million for 2008  the benefit for income taxes for 2009 is inclusive of a 206 million reversal of state tax valuation allowances the effective tax rate for 2009 differs from the federal statutory rate due predominately to these state tax benefits the effective tax rate for 2008 differs 

from the federal statutory rate predominately due to income tax benefits resulting from the completion of the irs examination and a full valuation allowance on our unrealized capital losses from our investment in fibertower see note 9 to our consolidated financial statements

adjusted ebitda for 2009 decreased by 09 million or 2 from 2008  adjusted ebitda was negatively impacted by the exchange rate fluctuations site rental gross margins decreased by 11 million or 2 for 2009 from 547 million 

net income loss attributable to ccic stockholders for 2009 was a net income of 11 million  compared to a net loss of 105 million for 2008 the change from net loss to net income was primarily driven by a decrease in interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs of 97 million the majority of which was due to a decrease in the variable interest rate of our intercompany debt 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

overview 

general we believe our site rental business can be characterized as a stable cash flow stream generated by revenues under longterm contracts that should be recurring for the foreseeable future for more than five years our cash from operations have exceeded our cash interest payments and sustaining capital expenditures and provided us with cash available for discretionary investments we seek to allocate the cash produced by our operations in a manner that will enhance per share operating results see item 1 business for a further discussion of how we seek to allocate our available capital during 2010 we increased our discretionary investments from 2009 levels as a result of the financial flexibility afforded by financing activities completed during 2009 and early 2010 that extended our debt maturities our significant financing activities during 2010 included the following 

 liquidity position the following is a summary of our capitalization and liquidity position see item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk and notes 6 and 8 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our debt 



 

 over the next 12 months we expect that our cash on hand undrawn revolver availability and cash flows from operating activities net of cash interest payments should be sufficient to cover our expected 1 debt service obligations of 287 million principal payments and 2 capital expenditures in excess of 300 million sustaining and discretionary as ccic and ccoc are holding companies this cash flow from operations is generated by our operating subsidiaries 

over the next twelve months we have no debt maturing other than nominal principal payments on amortizing debt we may utilize cash flows from operations to repay some or all of the 1570 million outstanding under the revolver prior to its maturity in september 2013 we do not anticipate the need to access the capital markets to refinance our existing debt until at least 2014 when our term loans mature  6256 million outstanding as of december 31 2010 however we may access the capital markets to fund our obligation to redeem all outstanding shares of 625 convertible preferred stock in august 2012 for approximately 318 million plus any unpaid dividends on that preferred stock see item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for a tabular presentation of our debt maturities as of december 31 2010 

longterm strategy we seek to maintain a capital structure that we believe drives longterm shareholder value and optimizes our weightedaverage cost of capital over the long term we target leverage of approximately five times adjusted ebitda and interest coverage of approximately three times adjusted ebitda subject to various factors such as the availability and cost of capital and the potential longterm return on our discretionary investments in furtherance of this longterm strategy we contemplate funding our discretionary investments primarily with operating cash flows and in certain instances potential future debt financings and issuances of equity or equity related securities as a result anticipated future growth in site rental cash flows and corresponding increases in adjusted ebitda should reduce our leverage conversely as our cash flows and adjusted ebitda grow we may seek to increase our debt in nominal dollars to maintain or achieve a certain targeted leverage despite this longterm strategy we may increase our leverage over the shorter term in order to pursue a discretionary investment 

summary cash flows information   



operating activities 

the increase in net cash provided by operating activities for 2010 from 2009 and 2008 was due primarily to growth in our core site rental business partially offset by an increase in the amount of cash used to meet working capital needs the yearoveryear increase in the working capital used in 2010 from 2009 of 993 million resulted primarily from changes in accrued interest and deferred site rental receivables changes in working capital and particularly changes in deferred site rental receivables deferred rental revenues prepaid ground leases restricted cash and accrued interest can have a significant impact on net cash from operating activities largely due to the timing of prepayments and receipts we expect net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december 31 2011 will be sufficient to cover the next 12 months of our expected debt service obligations and capital expenditures we expect to grow our cash flows provided by operating activities in the future exclusive of movements 

in working capital if we realize expected growth in our site rental business 

we pay minimal cash income taxes as a result of our net operating loss carryforwards we expect to generate taxable income in the future and based upon current projections we expect to fully utilize our 24 billion of federal net operating losses by 2017 

investing activities 

capital expenditures we categorize our capital expenditures as sustaining or discretionary sustaining capital expenditures include capitalized costs related to 1 maintenance activities on our towers which are generally related to replacements and upgrades that extend the life of the asset 2 vehicles 3 information technology equipment and 4 office equipment discretionary capital expenditures which we also commonly refer to as revenuegenerating capital expenditures include 1 purchases of land under towers 2 tower improvements in order to support additional site rentals and 3 the construction of towers 

a summary of our capital expenditures for the last three years is as follows   



as previously mentioned during 2010 we increased our capital expenditures from our 2009 levels following our financing activities in 2009 and 2010 that extended our debt maturities other than sustaining capital expenditures which we expect to be approximately 20 million to 25 million for the year ended december 31 2011 our capital expenditures are discretionary and are made with respect to activities which we believe exhibit sufficient potential to improve our longterm results of operations on a per share basis we expect to use in excess of 300 million of our cash flows on capital expenditures sustaining and discretionary for full year 2011 with less than onethird of our total capital expenditures targeted for our existing tower assets related to customer installations and related capacity improvement our decisions regarding capital expenditures are influenced by the availability and cost of capital and expected returns on alternative investments the following is a discussion of certain aspects of our capital expenditures 

 acquisitions in september 2010 we acquired newpath a provider of das networks through a merger with and into a subsidiary of ours the total cash consideration was approximately 128 million  see note 3 to our consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of the newpath acquisition 

financing activities 

as discussed in item 7 mda—liquidity and capital resources—overview as a result of the financial flexibility afforded us after completing these financing activities we increased our discretionary investments including purchases of our common stock and the settlement of all remaining forwardstarting interest rate swaps 

issuances of debt during 2010 we refinanced the 2005 tower revenue notes and the 2006 tower revenue notes through the issuance of the january 2010 tower revenue notes and the august 2010 tower revenues notes collectively 2010 tower revenue notes these refinancings extended our debt maturities as of december 31 2010 71 of our ccusa towers and the cash flows from these towers effectively secure 47 billion of our debt in addition distributions paid from our entities that hold approximately 4900 towers will also service this secured debt see note 6 to our consolidated financial statements for a further discussion on the refinancing of our tower revenue notes 

debt purchases and repayments see note 6 to our consolidated financial statements for a summary of our purchases and repayments of debt during 2009 and 2010 including the gains losses on purchases and repayments 

interest rate swaps during 2010 we settled all of our forwardstarting interest rate swaps see note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of interest rate swaps including 1 cash payments made to settle all remaining forwardstarting interest rate swaps and 2 the impact on our earnings 

common stock activity as of december 31 2010  2009 and 2008  we had 2908 million  2927 million and 2885 million common shares outstanding respectively during 2010 we purchased 41 million shares of common stock at an average price of 3862 per share utilizing 1596 million in cash we may continue to purchase our common stock in the future as we seek to allocate capital to discretionary investments in a manner that we believe will enhance per share results see item 1 business—strategy 

revolving credit agreement the proceeds of our revolving credit facility may be used for general corporate purposes which may include the financing of capital expenditures acquisitions and purchases of our common stock typically we use our revolving credit facility to fund discretionary investments and not for operating activities such as working capital since we generate cash flows from operations our only borrowing under the revolving credit facility during 2010 was 1570 million in december to fund a portion of the cash settlement of our previously outstanding forwardstarting interest rate swaps as of december 31 2010 the weightedaverage interest rate of the revolving credit facility was 24 including the credit spread see note 6 to our consolidated financial statements 

preferred stock dividends we have the option to pay dividends on our 625 convertible preferred stock in cash or shares of common stock valued at 95 of the current market value of the common stock as defined see item 5 market for registrants common equity related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities  since 2005 we have elected to pay the dividends in cash and expect to continue to do so for the foreseeable future we are required to redeem all outstanding shares of our 625 convertible preferred stock on august 15 2012 at a price equal to the liquidation preference plus accumulated and unpaid dividends the shares of 625 convertible preferred stock are convertible at the option of the holder in whole or in part at any time into shares of common stock at a conversion price of 36875 per share of common stock under certain circumstances we have the right to convert the 625 convertible preferred stock in whole or in part into 86 million shares of common stock if the price per share of our common stock equals or exceeds 120 of the conversion price or 4425 for at least 20 trading days in any consecutive 30day trading period 

restricted cash  pursuant to the indenture governing our operating companies debt all rental cash receipts of the issuers of these debt instruments and their subsidiaries are restricted and held by an indenture trustee the restricted cash in excess of required reserve balances is subsequently released to us in accordance with the terms of the indentures see also notes 2 and 6 to our consolidated financial statements 

contractual cash obligations 

the following table summarizes our contractual cash obligations as of december 31 2010  these contractual cash obligations relate primarily to our outstanding borrowings and lease obligations for land under our towers the debt maturities reflect contractual maturity dates and do not consider the impact of the principal payments that will commence following the anticipated repayment dates on the tower revenue notes see footnote b   



     

 25 

the land upon which our towers reside the cash obligations disclosed in the above table as of december 31 2010  are exclusive of estimated undiscounted future cash outlays for asset retirement obligations of approximately 17 billion as of december 31 2010  the net present value of these asset retirement obligations was approximately 638 million 

 the following table summarizes our rights to the land under our towers including renewal terms at our option as of december 31 2010  as of december 31 2010 the leases for land under our towers had an average remaining life of approximately 31 years weighted based on site rental gross margin see item 1a risk factors   



   

 debt covenants 

our debt obligations contain certain financial covenants with which ccic or our subsidiaries must maintain compliance in order to avoid the imposition of certain restrictions various of our debt obligations also place other restrictions on ccic or our subsidiaries including the ability to incur debt and liens purchase our securities make capital expenditures dispose of assets undertake transactions with affiliates make other investments and pay dividends we are permitted to issue additional indebtedness at ccic and at our operating subsidiaries if no covenant violations occur including the below mentioned restrictive covenants and certain other requirements are met which may include rating agency confirmations see note 6 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our debt covenants 

factors that are likely to determine our subsidiaries ability to comply with their current and future debt covenants include their 1 financial performance 2 levels of indebtedness and 3 debt service requirements given the current level of indebtedness and debt services requirements of our subsidiaries the primary risk of a debt covenant violation would be from a deterioration of a subsidiarys financial performance should a covenant violation occur in the future as a result of a shortfall in financial performance or for any other reason we might be required to make principal payments earlier than currently scheduled and may not have access to additional borrowings under these facilities as long as the covenant violation continues if we fail to comply with the debt restrictions we will be in default under those instruments which could cause the maturity of a substantial portion of our longterm indebtedness to be accelerated if our operating subsidiaries were to default on the debt the trustee could seek to pursue the collateral securing the debt in which case we could lose the towers and the future revenues associated with the towers we currently have no financial covenant violations and based upon our current expectations we believe our operating results will be sufficient to comply with our debt covenants over the near and longterm see item 1a risk factors 

the financial maintenance covenants under our debt agreements exclusive of cash trap reserve covenants are as follows 



 

 the following are the ratios applicable to the cash trap reserve covenants under our debt agreements that could require the cash flows generated by the issuers and their subsidiaries to be deposited in a reserve account and not released to us 

  



 

 the 9 senior notes and 7125 senior notes contain restrictive covenants with which ccic and our restricted subsidiaries must comply subject to a number of exceptions and qualifications including restrictions on our ability to incur incremental debt issue preferred stock guarantee debt pay dividends repurchase our capital stock use assets as security in other transactions sell assets or merge with or into other companies and make certain investments certain of these covenants are not applicable if there is no event of default and if the ratio of our consolidated debt as defined in the senior notes indenture to our adjusted consolidated cash flows as defined in the senior notes indenture is less than 70 to 1 as of december 31 2010 such restrictions were not applicable because there has been no event of default and our ratio of consolidated debt to adjusted consolidated cash flows is less than 70 to 1 based on our estimates of consolidated debt to adjusted consolidated cash flows and our current indebtedness we do not expect such restrictions to be applicable for the foreseeable future the 9 senior notes and 7125 senior notes do not contain any financial maintenance covenants 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we have no offbalance sheet arrangements as defined in item 303a4ii of regulation sk 

  

accounting and reporting matters 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the following is a discussion of the accounting policies and estimates that we believe 1 are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and 2 require our most difficult subjective or complex judgments often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain the critical accounting policies and 

estimates for 2010 are not intended to be a comprehensive list of our accounting policies and estimates see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for a summary of our significant accounting policies in many cases the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by gaap with no need for managements judgment in other cases management is required to exercise judgment in the application of accounting principles with respect to particular transactions 

revenue recognition over 90 of our total revenue for 2010 consists of site rental revenues which are recognized on a monthly basis over the fixed noncancelable term of the relevant contract generally ranging from five to 15 years regardless of whether the payments from the customer are received in equal monthly amounts if the payment terms call for fixed escalations as in fixed dollar or fixed percentage increases or rent free periods the effect is recognized on a straightline basis over the fixed noncancelable term of the contract when calculating our straightline rental revenues we consider all fixed elements of tenant contractual escalation provisions even if such escalation provisions contain a variable element such as an escalator tied to an inflationbased index in addition to a minimum upfront billings to customers for their negotiated share of the cost of tower modifications required to accommodate the installation of customer equipment are initially deferred and recognized over the term of the applicable site rental contract since we recognize revenue on a straightline basis a portion of the site rental revenue in a given period represents cash collected or contractually collectible in other periods we record a deferred site rental receivable for the difference between the straightlined amount and the rent billed we record an allowance for uncollectible deferred site rental revenues for which increases or reversals of this allowance impact our site rental revenues see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements 

we provide network services relating to our towers which represent less than 10 of our total revenues for 2010 network services and other revenue relate to installation services as well as the following additional services site acquisition architectural and engineering zoning and permitting other construction and other services related to network development network services revenues are recognized after completion of the applicable service we account for network services separately from the customers subsequent site rental 

see item 1 business—ccusa for a further discussion of our site rental and network services business 

accounting for longlived assets — valuation as of december 31 2010  our largest asset was our telecommunications towers representing approximately 39 billion or 80 of our 49 billion in net book value of property and equipment followed by intangible assets and goodwill approximately 23 billion and 20 billion in net book value respectively resulting predominately from the global signal merger in 2007 and other acquisitions of large tower portfolios nearly all approximately 22 billion net book value at december 31 2010  of our identifiable intangibles relate to the site rental contracts and customer relationships intangible assets see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the nature and composition of the site rental contracts and customer relationships intangible assets 

we allocate the purchase price of acquisitions to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair value at the date of acquisition any purchase price in excess of the net fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is allocated to goodwill in the case of the global signal merger we paid a purchase price that resulted in goodwill for two primary reasons 1 as a strategic measure to ensure that we maintained a tower portfolio of a comparable size to our largest competitor and 2 to deliver the needed control premium necessary to effect the transaction the fair value of the vast majority of our assets and liabilities is determined by using either 

 the purchase price allocation requires subjective estimates that if incorrectly estimated could be material to our consolidated financial statements including the amount of depreciation amortization and accretion expense the most important estimates for measurement of tangible fixed assets are 1 the cost to replace the asset with a new asset and 2 the economic useful life after giving effect to age quality and condition the most important estimates for measurement of intangible assets are 1 discount rates and 2 timing and amount of cash flows including estimates regarding customer renewals and cancellations the determination of the final purchase price allocation could extend over several quarters resulting in the use of preliminary estimates that are subject to adjustment until finalized 

we record the fair value of obligations to perform certain asset retirement activities including requirements pursuant to our ground leases to remove towers or remediate the land upon which our towers reside in determining the fair value of these asset retirement obligations we must make several subjective and highly judgmental estimates such as those related to 1 timing of cash flows 2 future costs and 3 discount rates see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements 

accounting for longlived assets — useful lives we are required to make subjective assessments as to the useful lives of our tangible and intangible assets for purposes of determining depreciation amortization and accretion expense that if incorrectly 

estimated could be material to our consolidated financial statements depreciation expense for our property and equipment is computed using the straightline method over the estimated useful lives of our various classes of tangible assets the substantial portion of our property and equipment represents the cost of our towers which is depreciated with an estimated useful life equal to the shorter of 1 20 years or 2 the term of the lease including optional renewals for the land under the tower 

the useful life of our intangible assets are estimated based on the period over which the intangible asset is expected to benefit us and gives consideration to the expected useful life of other assets to which the useful life may relate amortization expense for intangible assets is computed using the straightline method over the estimated useful life of each of the intangible assets the useful life of the site rental contracts and customer relationships intangible assets is limited by the maximum depreciable life of the tower 20 years as a result of the interdependency of the tower and site rental contracts and customer relationships in contrast the site rental contracts and customer relationships are estimated to provide economic benefits for several decades because of the low rate of customer cancellations and high rate of renewals experienced to date thus while site rental contracts and customer relationships are valued based upon the fair value of the site rental contracts and customer relationships which includes assumptions regarding both 1 customers exercise of optional renewals contained in the acquired contracts and 2 renewals of the acquired contracts past the contractual term including exercisable options the site rental contracts are amortized over a period not to exceed 20 years as a result of the useful life being limited by the depreciable life of the tower 

accounting for longlived assets — impairment evaluation — intangibles we review the carrying values of property and equipment intangible assets and other longlived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable we utilize the following dual grouping policy for purposes of determining the unit of account for testing impairment of the site rental contracts and customer relationships 

 we first pool site rental contracts and customer relationships intangible assets and property and equipment into portfolio groups for purposes of determining the unit of account for impairment testing because we view towers as portfolios and a tower in a given portfolio and its related customer contracts are not largely independent of the other towers in the portfolio we reevaluate the appropriateness of the pooled groups at least annually this use of grouping is based in part on 1 our limitations regarding disposal of towers 2 the interdependencies of tower portfolios and 3 the manner in which towers are traded in the marketplace the vast majority of our site rental contracts and customer relationships intangible assets and property and equipment are pooled into the us owned tower group secondly and separately we pool site rental contracts and customer relationships by significant customer or by customer grouping for individually insignificant customers as appropriate for purposes of determining the unit of account for impairment testing because we associate the value ascribed to site rental contracts and customer relationships intangible assets to the underlying contracts and related customer relationships acquired 

our determination that an adverse event or change in circumstance has occurred that indicates that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable will generally involve 1 a deterioration in an assets financial performance compared to historical results 2 a shortfall in an assets financial performance compared to forecasted results or 3 changes affecting the utility of the asset when considering the utility of our assets we consider events that would meaningfully impact 1 our towers or 2 our customer relationships for example consideration would be given to events that impact 1 the structural integrity and longevity of our towers or 2 our ability to derive benefit from our existing customer relationships including events such as bankruptcy or insolvency or loss of a significant customer during 2010  there were no events or circumstances that caused us to review the carrying value of our intangible assets and property and equipment due in part to our assets performing consistently with or better than our expectations 

if the sum of the estimated future cash flows undiscounted from an asset or portfolio group significant customer or customer group for individually insignificant customers as applicable is less than its carrying amount an impairment loss is recognized if the carrying value were to exceed the undiscounted cash flows measurement of an impairment loss would be based on the fair value of the asset which is based on an estimate of discounted future cash flows the most important estimates for such calculations of undiscounted cash flows are 1 the expected additions of new tenants and equipment on our towers and 2 estimates regarding customer cancellations and renewals of contracts we could record impairments in the future if changes in longterm market conditions expected future operating results or the utility of the assets results in changes for our impairment test calculations which negatively impact the fair value of our property and equipment and intangible assets or if we changed our unit of account in the future 

when grouping assets into pools for purposes of impairment evaluation we also consider individual towers within a grouping for which we currently have no tenants approximately 2 of our total towers currently have no tenants we continue to pay 

operating expenses on these towers in anticipation of obtaining tenants on these towers in the future primarily because of the individual tower site demographics in fact we have current visibility to potential tenants on approximately half of these towers to the extent we do not believe there are longterm prospects of obtaining tenants on an individual tower and all other possible avenues for recovering the carrying value of the tower have been exhausted including sale of the tower we appropriately reduce the carrying value of such towers 

accounting for longlived assets — impairment evaluation — goodwill nearly all of our goodwill is recorded at ccusa we test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis regardless of whether adverse events or changes in circumstances have occurred the annual test begins with goodwill and all intangible assets being allocated to applicable reporting units goodwill is then tested using a twostep process that begins with an estimation of fair value of the reporting unit using an income approach which looks to the present value of expected future cash flows the first step commonly referred to as a step one impairment test is a screen for potential impairment while the second step measures the amount of impairment if there is an indication from the first step that one exists our reporting units are the operating segments since segment management operates their respective tower portfolios as a single network our measurement of the fair value for goodwill is based on an estimate of discounted future cash flows of the reporting unit the most important estimates for such calculations are 1 expected additions of new tenants and equipment on our towers 2 estimates regarding customer cancellations and renewal of customer contracts 3 the terminal multiple for our projected cash flows 4 our weightedaverage cost of capital and 5 control premium 

on october 1 2010 we performed our annual goodwill impairment test the results of this test indicated that goodwill was not impaired at either of our reporting units the fair value of our net assets as measured by our market capitalization was over five times greater than the aggregate carrying amount of the reporting units as of december 31 2010  although we currently are not at risk of failing a step one impairment test a future change in our reporting units unit of account or assumptions surrounding the most important estimates included in our impairment test could result in the recognition of an impairment 

interest rate swaps we enter into interest rate swaps to manage and reduce our interest rate risk the designation of our interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges requires judgment including with respect to the required assessment of the effectiveness of hedging relationships both at inception and on an ongoing basis the effective portion of changes in fair value of interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges is recorded in aoci and is recognized in earnings when the hedged item affects earnings in contrast the change in fair value of interest rate swaps related to hedge ineffectiveness and for those not designated as cash flow hedges is immediately marked to market in earnings in assessing the effectiveness of our forwardstarting swaps both at inception and on an ongoing basis we must make several highly subjective and judgmental estimates such as assessing 1 the timing amount nature and probability of future expected refinancings and 2 whether it is probable that the counterparties to our swaps will default see also notes 2  7 and 8 to our consolidated financial statements 

deferred income taxes we record deferred income tax assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet related to events that impact our financial statements and tax returns in different periods in order to compute these deferred tax balances we first analyze the differences between the book basis and tax basis of our assets and liabilities referred to as temporary differences these temporary differences are then multiplied by current tax rates to arrive at the balances for the deferred income tax assets and liabilities a valuation allowance is provided on deferred tax assets that do not meet the more likely than not realization threshold we recognize a tax position if it is more likely than not it will be sustained upon examination the tax position is measured at the largest amount that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 

before giving effect to any valuation allowances we are in an overall net deferred tax asset position due to our history of tax operating losses we have recorded a valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets that do not meet the more likely than not realization threshold as a result we are in effect limited in our ability to recognize tax benefits in our results of operations in the future as further discussed in note 9 to our consolidated financial statements we do not anticipate recognizing additional federal tax benefits unless future discrete events allow us to record additional deferred tax liabilities if our expectations about the future tax consequences of past events should prove to be inaccurate the balances of our deferred income tax assets and liabilities could require significant adjustments in future periods such adjustments could cause a material effect on our results of operations for the period of the adjustment 

impact of accounting standards issued but not yet adopted and those adopted in 2010 

in october 2009 fasb issued guidance that addressed how to recognize revenue for transactions with multiple deliverables this guidance revises the criteria for separating measuring and allocating arrangement consideration to each consideration deliverable which must be estimated if there is not a history of selling the deliverable on a standalone basis or thirdparty evidence of selling price the provisions of this guidance are effective for us as of january 1 2011 and will be applied prospectively we expect that the adoption of this guidance will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and will not result in a change to the pattern and timing of our revenue recognition 

nongaap financial measures 

our measurement of profit or loss currently used to evaluate the operating performance of our operating segments is earnings before interest taxes depreciation amortization and accretion as adjusted or adjusted ebitda our definition of adjusted ebitda is set forth in item 7 mda—results of operations—comparison of operating segments   our measure of adjusted ebitda may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies including companies in the tower sector and is not a measure of performance calculated in accordance with gaap adjusted ebitda should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for operating income or loss net income or loss cash flows provided by used for operating investing and financing activities or other income statement or cash flow statement data prepared in accordance with gaap 

we believe adjusted ebitda is useful to an investor in evaluating our operating performance because 

 our management uses adjusted ebitda 

 there are material limitations to using a measure such as adjusted ebitda including the difficulty associated with comparing results among more than one company including our competitors and the inability to analyze certain significant items including depreciation and interest expense that directly affect our net income or loss management compensates for these limitations by considering the economic effect of the excluded expense items independently as well as in connection with their analysis of net income loss 

  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

our primary exposures to market risks are related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates which may adversely affect our results of operations and financial position we seek to manage exposure to changes in interest rates where economically prudent to do so by utilizing predominately fixed rate debt we do not currently hedge against foreign currency exchange risks 

interest rate risk 

our interest rate risk relates primarily to the impact of interest rate movements on the following 

 31 

 potential refinancing of existing debt 

over the next 12 months we have no debt maturities other than nominal principal payments on amortizing debt we do not anticipate the need to access the capital markets to refinance our existing debt until at least 2014 when our term loans mature in addition we may access the capital markets to fund our obligation to redeem all outstanding shares of 625 convertible preferred stock in august 2012 for approximately 318 million in addition to any unpaid dividends on that preferred stock as of december 31 2010 we have no interest rate swaps hedging any refinancings see item 7 mda—liquidity and capital resources—overview 

floating rate debt 

we manage our exposure to market interest rates on our existing debt by 1 controlling the mix of fixed and floating rate debt and 2 utilizing interest rate swaps to hedge variability in cash flows from changes in libor on our outstanding floating rate debt as of december 31 2010  we had 7826 million of floating rate debt of which 6000 million is effectively converted to a fixed rate through an interest rate swap until december 2011 as a result a hypothetical unfavorable fluctuation in market interest rates on our existing debt of two percentage points over a twelvemonth period would increase our interest expense by approximately 37 million 

potential future borrowings of incremental debt 

we typically do not hedge our exposure to interest rates on potential future borrowings of incremental debt for a substantial period prior to issuance see item 7 mda—liquidity and capital resources regarding our shortterm liquidity strategy 

  

the following table provides information about our market risk related to changes in interest rates the future principal payments and weightedaverage interest rates are presented as of december 31 2010  these debt maturities reflect contractual maturity dates and do not consider the impact of the principal payments that will commence following the anticipated repayment dates on the tower revenue notes see footnote c see note 6 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our debt 



   

   

  

  

foreign currency risk 

the vast majority of our foreign currency risk is related to the australian dollar which is the functional currency of ccal ccal represented 5 of our consolidated revenues and 4 of our consolidated operating income for 2010  as of december 31 2010  the australian dollar exchange rate had strengthened compared to the us dollar by approximately 16 from the average rate for 2009  see item 7 mda—results of operations—comparison of operating segments 

foreign exchange markets have recently been volatile and we expect foreign exchange markets to continue to be volatile over the near term we believe the risk related to our financial instruments exclusive of intercompany financing deemed a longterm investment denominated in australian dollars is not significant to our financial condition a hypothetical increase or decrease of 25 in australian dollar exchange rate would increase or decrease the fair value of our financial instruments by approximately 8 million

 item 1 business tableend overview 

we own operate and lease towers rooftop installations and other communication structures collectively “towers” for wireless communications our core business is renting space on our towers via longterm contracts in various forms including license sublease and lease agreements our towers can accommodate multiple customers “colocation” for antennas and other equipment necessary for the transmission of wireless signals for mobile telephones and other devices revenues derived from this site rental business represented 92 of our 2009 consolidated revenues our site rental revenues are of a recurring nature and typically in excess of 90 have been contracted for in a prior year we seek to increase our site rental revenues by adding more tenants on our towers which we expect to result in significant incremental cash flow due to our relatively fixed tower operating costs 

information concerning our tower portfolio as of december 31 2009 is as follows 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 to a lesser extent we also provide certain network services relating to our towers including antenna installations and subsequent augmentation network design and site selection site acquisition site development and other services 

  

strategy 

our strategy is to increase longterm stockholder value by translating anticipated future growth in our core site rental business into growth of our results of operations on a per share basis we believe our strategy is consistent with our mission to deliver the highest level of service to our customers at all times – striving to be their critical partner as we assist them in growing efficient ubiquitous wireless networks the key elements of our strategy are to 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 our longterm strategy is based on our belief that opportunities will be created by the expected continuation of growth in the wireless communications industry which depends on the demand for wireless telephony and data services by consumers despite the recent economic weakness and uncertainty demand during 2009 continued to grow for wireless services including with respect to data services and third generation “3g” and fourth generation “4g” technologies data services have driven growth in the wireless communication industry while the rate of growth of voice services and wireless users has slowed the following is a discussion of certain growth trends in the wireless communications industry 

 

  

  

  

   

  

  

  

  

  

 2009 highlights and recent developments 

see “item 7 mda” and our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of developments and activities occurring in 2009 and the beginning of 2010 including the issuance of 48 billion face value of debt and the repayment and repurchase of 44 billion face value of debt in conjunction with laddering and extending the maturities of our debt 

the company 

virtually all of our operations are located in the us and australia we conduct our operations principally through subsidiaries of crown castle operating company “ccoc” including 1 certain subsidiaries which operate our tower portfolios in the us and 2 a 776 owned subsidiary that operates our australia tower portfolio for more information about our operating segments as well as financial information about the geographic areas in which we operate see note 19 to our consolidated financial statements and “item 7 mda  ” 

ccusa 

site rental the core business of ccusa is the renting of antenna space on our towers to a much lesser extent we lease access to our distributed antenna systems we predominately rent to wireless carriers under longterm contracts for the transmission of a variety of wireless signals related to wireless voice and data transmission at december 31 2009 ccusa owned leased or managed approximately 22400 towers the vast majority of our ccusa towers are located in the us with concentrations in the 100 largest btas 

most of our ccusa towers were acquired from the four largest wireless carriers or their predecessors through transactions consummated during the last decade including 1 approximately 10700 towers from global signal in 2007 of which approximately 6600 were originally acquired from sprint 2 approximately 4800 towers during 1999 to 2000 from companies now part of verizon wireless 3 approximately 2700 towers during 1999 to 2000 from companies now part of att as well as 4 other smaller acquisitions from companies now part of tmobile and other independent tower operators 

we generally receive monthly rental payments from tenants payable under site leases we have existing master lease agreements with most wireless carriers including verizon wireless att sprint nextel tmobile and clearwire which provide certain terms including economic terms that govern leases on our towers entered into by such parties during the term of their master lease agreements the lease agreements with our tenants typically result from longterm contracts with 1 initial terms of five to 15 years 2 multiple renewal periods at the option of the tenant of five to ten years each 3 limited termination rights for our customers and 4 contractual escalations of the rental price more recently we have negotiated up to 15 year terms for both initial and renewal periods for certain of our customers and are endeavoring to continue that trend as of december 31 2009 our customer contracts at ccusa have a weightedaverage current term of ten years with a weighted average of approximately seven years remaining on this ten year current term exclusive of renewals at the customer’s option 

  

our tenant leases have a high renewal rate because of 1 the critical location of our towers within our customers’ networks 2 customers’ cost associated with relocation of its antennas and other equipment to another tower and 3 zoning and other barriers associated with the construction of new towers with limited exceptions the customer lease agreements may not be terminated in general each customer lease agreement which is renewable will automatically renew at the end of its term unless the customer provides prior notice of its intent not to renew 

see note 18 to our consolidated financial statements for a tabular presentation of the minimum rental cash payments due to us by tenants pursuant to lease agreements without consideration of tenant renewal options 

the average monthly rental payment of a new tenant added to a tower varies based on 1 the different regions in the us 2 aggregate customer volume and 3 the type of signal transmitted by the tenant primarily as a result of the physical size of the antenna installation and related equipment we also routinely receive rental payment increases in connection with lease amendments pursuant to which our customers add additional antennas or other equipment to towers on which they already have equipment pursuant to preexisting lease agreements 

approximately twothirds of our direct site operating expenses consist of ground lease expenses and the remainder includes property taxes repairs and maintenance employee compensation and related benefit costs and utilities our operating expenses tend to escalate at approximately the rate of inflation as a result of the relatively fixed nature of these expenditures the colocation of additional tenants is achieved at a low incremental operating cost resulting in high incremental operating cash flows our tower portfolio requires minimal sustaining capital expenditures including tower maintenance and other nondiscretionary capital expenditures and are typically less than 2 of site rental revenues 

network services to a lesser extent we also offer our customers certain network services relating to our towers we have grown our network services business over the last several years as a result of management’s emphasis on this business including our focus on customer service and increasing our market share for installation on our towers our network services primarily consist of antenna installations and subsequent augmentations as well as site acquisition services engineering services permitting other construction services and other services related to network deployments we have the capability and expertise to install with the assistance of our network of subcontractors equipment and antenna systems for our customers these activities are typically nonrecurring and highly competitive with a number of local competitors in most markets we typically bill for our antenna installation services on a costplus profit basis and to a lesser extent on a fixed price basis network services revenues are received primarily from wireless communications companies or their agents 

customers we work extensively with large national wireless carriers and in general our customers are primarily comprised of providers of wireless voice and data services who operate national or regional networks approximately 53 of 2009 ccusa site rental revenues are with customers or their parent companies who are rated investment grade including verizon wireless a joint venture of verizon communications and vodafone att and tmobile a subsidiary of deutsche telecom in addition to the four largest customers see table below our 2009 new tenant additions were derived from second tier and emerging wireless customers such as those offering flat rate calling plans and wireless data technologies the following table summarizes the net revenues from our four largest customers expressed as a percentage of ccusa’s and our consolidated revenues for 2009 see “ item 1a risk factors ” 

 

 in addition new entrants in the wireless industry are emerging as new technologies become available and the fcc authorizes additional spectrum for use a recent example is clearwire a provider of wireless mobile internet services 

  

sales and marketing the ccusa sales organization markets our towers within the wireless communications industry with the objectives of renting space on existing towers and on new towers prior to construction as well as obtaining network services related to our towers we seek to become the critical partner and preferred independent tower provider for our customers and increase customer satisfaction relative to our peers by leveraging our 1 technological tools 2 process centric approach and 3 customer relationships 

we use public and proprietary databases to develop targeted marketing programs focused on carrier network buildouts modifications site additions new tower builds distributed antenna systems and network services information about our customers’ existing location of antenna space leases marketing strategies capital spend plans deployment status and actual wireless carrier signal strength measurements taken in the field is analyzed to match specific towers in our portfolios with potential new site demand we have developed a patented webbased tool that stores key tower information above and beyond normal property management information including data on actual customer signal strength demographics site readiness and competitive structures in addition the webbased tool assists us in estimating potential demand for our towers with greater speed and accuracy we believe these and other tools we have developed assist our customers in their site selection and deployment of their wireless networks and provide us with an opportunity to have proactive discussions with them regarding their wireless infrastructure deployment plans and the timing and location of their demand for our towers a key aspect to our sales and marketing strategy is a continued emphasis on our process centric approach to reduce cycle time related to new leasing and amendments which helps provide our customers with faster deployment of their networks 

a team of national account directors maintains our relationships with our largest customers these directors work to develop tower leasing opportunities network services contracts and site management opportunities as well as to ensure that customers’ tower needs are efficiently translated into new leases on our towers sales personnel in our area offices develop and maintain local relationships with our customers that are expanding their networks entering new markets bringing new technologies to market or requiring maintenance or addon business in addition to our fulltime sales and marketing staff a number of senior managers and officers spend a significant portion of their time on sales and marketing activities and call on existing and prospective customers 

competition ccusa competes with 1 other independent tower owners which also provide site rental and network services 2 wireless carriers which build own and operate their own tower networks and lease space to other wireless communication companies and 3 owners of alternative facilities including rooftops water towers broadcast towers distributed antenna systems and utility poles some of the larger independent tower companies with which ccusa competes in the us include american tower corporation sba communications corporation global tower partners and towerco wireless carriers that own and operate their own tower networks generally are substantially larger and have greater financial resources than we have we believe that tower location and capacity deployment speed quality of service and price have been and will continue to be the most significant competitive factors affecting the leasing of a tower 

competitors in the network services business include site acquisition consultants zoning consultants real estate firms rightofway consulting firms construction companies tower owners and managers radio frequency engineering consultants telecommunications equipment vendors who can provide turnkey site development services through multiple subcontractors and our customers’ internal staffs we believe that our customers base their decisions on the outsourcing of network services on criteria such as a company’s experience track record local reputation price and time for completion of a project 

ccal 

our primary business in australia is the renting of antenna space on towers to our customers ccal is owned 776 by us and 224 by permanent nominees aust ltd acting on behalf of a group of professional and private investors led by todd capital limited ccal is the largest independent tower operator in australia as of december 31 2009 ccal had approximately 1600 towers with a strategic presence in each of australia’s major metropolitan areas including sydney melbourne brisbane adelaide and perth the majority of ccal’s towers were acquired from optus in 2000 and vodafone in 2001 ccal also provides a range of services including site maintenance and property management services for towers owned by third parties 

for 2009 ccal comprised 5 of our consolidated net revenues ccal’s principal customers are telstra optus and vha for 2009 these three customers accounted for approximately 95 of ccal’s revenues in june 2009 vodafone and hutchison merged their australian operations in a joint venture named vha pty ltd with the intention to market primarily under the name vodafone 

  

in australia ccal competes with wireless carriers which own and operate their own tower networks service companies that provide site maintenance and property management services and other site owners such as broadcasters and building owners the other significant tower owners in australia are broadcast australia an independent operator of broadcast towers and telstra and optus wireless carriers we believe that tower location capacity quality of service deployment speed and price within a geographic market are the most significant competitive factors affecting the leasing of a tower 

all of the major carriers in australia have deployed extensive 3g networks which provide high bandwidth wireless services that are generally more robust and faster than typically experienced in the us in addition the wireless penetration rate in australia is nearly 115 ie the number of devices exceeds population compared with 91 in the us these 3g networks utilize a large number of our towers

at january 31 2010 we employed approximately 1200 people worldwide including approximately 1100 in the us we are not a party to any collective bargaining agreements we have not experienced any strikes or work stoppages and management believes that our employee relations are satisfactory 

regulatory matters 

to date we have not incurred any material fines or penalties or experienced any material adverse effects to our business as a result of any domestic or international regulations the summary below is based on regulations currently in effect and such regulations are subject to review and modification by the applicable governmental authority from time to time if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations we may be fined or even lose our rights to conduct some of our business 

united states 

federal regulations both the fcc and the federal aviation administration “faa” regulate towers used for wireless communications radio and television broadcasting such regulations control the siting lighting and marking of towers and may depending on the characteristics of particular towers require the registration of tower facilities with the fcc and the issuance of determinations confirming no hazard to air traffic wireless communications devices operating on towers are separately regulated and independently licensed based upon the particular frequency used in addition the fcc and the faa have developed standards to consider proposals for new or modified tower and antenna structures based upon the height and location including proximity to airports proposals to construct or to modify existing tower and antenna structures above certain heights are reviewed by the faa to ensure the structure will not present a hazard to aviation which determination may be conditioned upon compliance with lighting and marking requirements the fcc requires its licensees to operate communications devices only on towers that comply with faa rules and are registered with the fcc if required by its regulations where tower lighting is required by faa regulation tower owners bear the responsibility of notifying the faa of any tower lighting outage and ensuring the timely restoration of such outages failure to comply with the applicable requirements may lead to civil penalties 

local regulations the us telecommunications act of 1996 amended the communications act of 1934 to preserve state and local zoning authorities’ jurisdiction over the siting of communications towers the law however limits local zoning authority by prohibiting actions by local authorities that discriminate between different service providers of wireless services or ban altogether the provision of wireless services additionally the law prohibits state and local restrictions based on the environmental effects of radio frequency emissions to the extent the facilities comply with fcc regulations 

local regulations include city and other local ordinances including subdivision and zoning ordinances approvals for construction modification and removal of towers and restrictive covenants imposed by community developers these regulations vary greatly but typically require us to obtain approval from local officials prior to tower construction local zoning authorities may render decisions that prevent the construction or modification of towers or place conditions on such construction or modifications that are responsive to community residents’ 

  

concerns regarding the height visibility and other characteristics of the towers to expedite the deployment of wireless networks the fcc issued a declaratory ruling in november 2009 establishing timeframes for the review of applications by local and state governments of 90 days for colocations and 150 days for new tower construction if a jurisdiction fails to act within these timeframes the applicant may file a claim for relief in court notwithstanding this declaratory ruling decisions of local zoning authorities may also adversely affect the timing and cost of tower construction and modification 

other regulations we hold through certain of our subsidiaries certain licenses for radio transmission facilities granted by the fcc including licenses for common carrier microwave service commercial and private mobile radio service specialized mobile radio and paging service which are subject to additional regulation by the fcc our fcc license relating to our 16701675 mhz us nationwide spectrum license “spectrum” contains certain conditions related to the services that may be provided thereunder the technical equipment used in connection therewith and the circumstances under which it may be renewed we are required to obtain the fcc’s approval prior to assigning or transferring control of our fcc licenses 

australia 

federal regulations carrier licenses and nominated carrier declarations issued under the australian telecommunications act 1997 authorize the use of network units for the supply of telecommunications services to the public the definition of “network units” includes line links and base stations used for wireless telephony services but does not include tower infrastructure accordingly ccal as a tower owner and operator does not require a carrier license under the australian telecommunications act 1997 similarly because ccal does not own any transmitters or spectrum it does not currently require any apparatus or spectrum licenses issued under the australian radiocommunications act 1992 

carriers have a statutory obligation to provide other carriers with access to towers and if there is a dispute including a pricing dispute the matter may be referred to the australian competition and consumer commission for resolution as a noncarrier ccal is not subject to this regime and our customers negotiate site access on a commercial basis 

while the australian telecommunications act 1997 grants certain exemptions from planning laws for the installation of “low impact facilities” newly constructed towers are expressly excluded from the definition of “low impact facilities” accordingly in connection with the construction of towers ccal is subject to state and local planning laws which vary on a site by site basis structural enhancements may be undertaken on behalf of a carrier without state and local planning approval under the general “maintenance power” under the australian telecommunications act 1997 although these enhancements may be subject to state and local planning laws if ccal is unable to obtain carrier cooperation to use such power for a limited number of towers ccal is also required to install aircraft warning lighting in compliance with federal aviation regulations in australia a carrier may arguably be able to utilize the “maintenance power” under the australian telecommunications act 1997 to remain as a tenant on a tower after the expiration of a site license or sublease however ccal’s customer access agreements generally limit the ability of customers to do this and even if a carrier did utilize this power the carrier would be required to pay for ccal’s financial loss which would roughly equal the site rental revenues that would have otherwise been payable 

local regulations in australia there are various local state and territory laws and regulations which relate to among other things town planning and zoning restrictions standards and approvals for the design construction or alteration of a structure or facility and environmental regulations as in the us these laws vary greatly but typically require tower owners to obtain approval from governmental bodies prior to tower construction and to comply with environmental laws on an ongoing basis 

environmental matters 

to date we have not incurred any material fines or penalties or experienced any material adverse effects to our business as a result of any domestic or international environmental regulations or matters see “item 1a risk factors” 

  

the construction of new towers and in some cases the modification of existing towers in the us may be subject to environmental review under the national environmental policy act of 1969 as amended “nepa” which requires federal agencies to evaluate the environmental impact of major federal actions the fcc has promulgated regulations implementing nepa which require applicants to investigate the potential environmental impact of the proposed tower construction should the proposed tower construction present a significant environmental impact the fcc must prepare an environmental impact statement subject to public comment if the proposed construction or modification of a tower may have a significant impact on the environment the fcc’s approval of the construction or modification could be significantly delayed 

our operations are subject to federal state and local laws and regulations relating to the management use storage disposal emission and remediation of and exposure to hazardous and nonhazardous substances materials and wastes as an owner lessee or operator of real property we are subject to certain environmental laws that impose strict jointandseveral liability for the cleanup of onsite or offsite contamination relating to existing or historical operations and we could also be subject to personal injury or property damage claims relating to such contamination in general license agreements prohibit our customers from using or storing any hazardous substances on our tower sites in violation of applicable environmental laws and require our customers to provide notice of certain environmental conditions caused by them 

as licensees and tower owners we are also subject to regulations and guidelines that impose a variety of operational requirements relating to radio frequency emissions as employers we are subject to occupational safety and health administration and similar occupational health and safety legislation in australia and similar guidelines regarding employee protection from radio frequency exposure the potential connection between radio frequency emissions and certain negative health effects including some forms of cancer has been the subject of substantial study by the scientific community in recent years 

we have compliance programs and monitoring projects to help assure that we are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws nevertheless there can be no assurance that the costs of compliance with existing or future environmental laws will not have a material adverse effect on us

 item 1a risk factors tableend you should carefully consider all of the risks described below as well as the other information contained in this document when evaluating your investment in our securities 

our substantial level of indebtedness could adversely affect our ability to react to changes in our business and the terms of our debt instruments limit our ability to take a number of actions that our management might otherwise believe to be in our best interests in addition if we fail to comply with our covenants our debt could be accelerated 

as a result of our substantial indebtedness 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 currently we have debt instruments in place that limit in certain circumstances our ability to incur indebtedness pay dividends create liens sell assets and engage in certain mergers and acquisitions our subsidiaries under their debt instruments are also required to maintain specific financial ratios our ability to comply with the financial ratio covenants under these instruments and to satisfy our debt obligations will depend on our future operating performance if we fail to comply with the debt restrictions we will be in default under those instruments which 

  

would cause the maturity of a substantial portion of our longterm indebtedness to be accelerated if our operating subsidiaries were to default on the debt the trustee could seek to foreclose the collateral securing the debt in which case we could lose the towers and the revenues associated with the towers 

ccic and ccoc are holding companies and conduct all of their operations through their subsidiaries accordingly ccic’s and ccoc’s respective sources of cash to pay interest and principal on their outstanding indebtedness and preferred stock are distributions relating to their respective ownership interests in their subsidiaries from the net earnings and cash flow generated by such subsidiaries or from proceeds of debt or equity offerings earnings and cash flow generated by their subsidiaries are first applied by such subsidiaries in conducting their operations including the service of their respective debt obligations after which any excess cash flow generally may be paid to a holding company however their subsidiaries are legally distinct from the holding companies and unless they guarantee such debt have no obligation to pay amounts due on their debt or to make funds available to us for such payment 

we have a substantial amount of indebtedness in the event we do not repay or refinance such indebtedness we could face substantial liquidity issues and might be required to issue equity securities or securities convertible into equity securities or sell some of our assets to meet our debt payment obligations 

we have a substantial amount of indebtedness approximately 64 billion as of january 31 2010 which we will need to refinance or repay see “item 7 mda—liquidity and capital resources” for a tabular presentation of our contractual debt maturities we are also required to redeem all outstanding shares of our 625 convertible preferred stock in august 2012 for approximately 3180 million in addition to any unpaid dividends on that preferred stock we plan on endeavoring to refinance the 2006 tower revenue notes on or before their anticipated repayment date in 2011 there can be no assurances we will be able to refinance our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or terms including with respect to interest rates as favorable as our current debt and preferred stock or at all 

if our tower revenue notes which were issued by our us tower subsidiaries that comprised substantially all of our us towers prior to the global signal merger and had an aggregate outstanding principal amount of 32 billion as of january 31 2010 are not repaid in full by their anticipated repayment dates which range from 2011 to 2020 then the interest rates on those notes will increase substantially by the greater of 1 an additional 5 per annum over their current rates or 2 the amount if any by which the sum of the following exceeds the note rate for a class of tower revenue notes the yield to maturity on the applicable anticipated repayment date of the united states treasury security having a term closest to ten years plus 5 plus the postanticipated repayment date spread for such class of tower revenue notes and monthly amortization payments will commence if this occurs then substantially all of the cash flows of those tower subsidiaries must be applied to repay the principal of the tower revenue notes 

in addition based on current interest rates and the yield curve in effect as of december 31 2009 our interest rate swaps are in a substantial liability position see “ item 1a risk factors—our interest rate swaps are currently in a substantial liability position and will need to be cash settled within the next two years which could adversely affect our financial condition” 

the global credit and capital markets are undergoing a period of substantial volatility and disruption and the global economy is experiencing weakness and uncertainty although the credit markets have improved during 2009 we believe that this volatile credit environment has resulted in increased interest rates in the marketplace in general and for us specifically as compared to periods immediately prior to 2007 any renewed financial turmoil worsening credit environment economic weakness and uncertainty could impact the availability and cost of debt financing including with respect to any refinancing of the obligations described above 

if we are unable to refinance or renegotiate our debt we cannot guarantee that we will be able to generate enough cash flows from operations or that we will be able to obtain enough capital to service our debt pay our obligations under our convertible preferred stock or fund our planned capital expenditures in such an event we could face substantial liquidity issues and might be required to issue equity securities or securities convertible into equity securities or sell some of our assets to meet our debt payment obligations failure to refinance indebtedness when required could result in a default under such indebtedness assuming we meet certain financial ratios we have the ability under our debt instruments to incur additional indebtedness and any additional indebtedness we incur could exacerbate the risks described above 

  

our interest rate swaps are currently in a substantial liability position and will need to be cash settled within the next two years which could adversely affect our financial condition 

we have used interest rate swaps to hedge our interest rate risk which could adversely affect our financial condition as a result of our interest rate swaps we would not benefit from the recent declines in benchmark interest rates if the declines remain when we ultimately cash settle these obligations as of january 31 2010 our outstanding forwardstarting interest rate swaps had a combined notional amount of 50 billion and the liability totaled 4084 million on a settlement basis in addition we have interest rate swaps with a combined notional amount of 6000 million that will be settled over 2010 and 2011 and would currently result in total payments by us of 33 million on a settlement basis as of january 31 2010 see “item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” for the cash obligations by year of maturity based on current interest rates and the yield curve in effect as of december 31 2009 required to settle the forwardstarting interest rate swaps 

our business depends on the demand for wireless communications and towers and we may be adversely affected by any slowdown in such demand 

demand for our towers depends on the demand for antenna space from our customers which in turn depends on the demand for wireless telephony and data services by their customers the willingness of our customers to utilize our infrastructure or renew existing leases on our towers is affected by numerous factors including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 a slowdown in demand for wireless communications or our towers may negatively impact our growth or otherwise have a material adverse effect on us 

a substantial portion of our revenues is derived from a small number of customers and the loss consolidation or financial instability of or network sharing among any of our limited number of customers may materially decrease revenues and reduce demand for our towers and network services 

for 2009 approximately 73 of our consolidated revenues was derived from sprint nextel att verizon wireless and tmobile which represented 22 20 18 and 13 respectively of our consolidated net revenues the loss of any one of our large customers as a result of bankruptcy insolvency consolidation merger with other customers of ours or otherwise may materially decrease our revenues and have other adverse effects on our business we cannot guarantee that leases including management agreements with our major customers will not be terminated or that these customers will renew their lease agreements with us see also “item 1 business—the company” 

consolidation among our customers may result in duplicate or overlapping parts of networks which may result in a reduction of sites and have a negative effect on revenues and cash flows 

consolidation among our customers will likely result in duplicate or overlapping parts of networks which may result in a reduction of cell sites and impact revenues from our towers in addition consolidation may result in a reduction in such customers’ future capital expenditures in the aggregate because their expansion plans may be similar in the last several years certain of our larger carrier customers have merged including cingular wireless 

  

now known as att with att wireless in october 2004 and sprint with nextel in august 2005 any industry consolidation could decrease the demand for our towers which in turn may result in a reduction in our revenues and cash flows 

sales or issuances of a substantial number of shares of our common stock may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

future sales or issuances of a substantial number of shares of our common stock or other equity related securities may adversely affect the market price of our common stock as of february 5 2010 we had 2929 million shares of common stock outstanding and we reserved 1 112 million shares of common stock for future issuance under our various stock compensation plans and 2 86 million shares of common stock for the conversion of our outstanding convertible preferred stock if we are not able to refinance our debt over the longterm we may face liquidity issues and might be required to issue equity securities or securities convertible into equity securities which may cause the price of our common stock to decline significantly 

in addition a small number of stockholders own a significant percentage of our outstanding common stock if any one of these stockholders or any group of our stockholders sells a large quantity of shares of our common stock or the public market perceives that existing stockholders might sell a large quantity of shares of our common stock the market price of our common stock may significantly decline 

a wireless communications industry slowdown may materially and adversely affect our business including reducing demand for our towers and network services and the business of our customers 

in past years the wireless communications industry has periodically experienced general slowdowns which negatively affected the factors described in these risk factors thereby reducing demand for tower space and network services similar slowdowns in the future may reduce consumer demand for wireless services or negatively impact the debt and equity markets accessed by the wireless communications industry thereby causing carriers to delay or abandon implementation of new systems technologies and coverage areas beginning in 2008 the global credit and capital markets have undergone substantial volatility and disruption and the economy is experiencing weakness and uncertainty there can be no assurances that such a difficult economic environment will not adversely impact the wireless communications industry which may materially and adversely affect our business including by reducing demand for our towers and network services in addition such a slowdown may increase competition for site rental customers and network services a wireless communications industry slowdown may result in the writeoff of some or all of our goodwill and our inability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards 

as a result of competition in our industry including from some competitors with significantly more resources or less debt than we have we may find it more difficult to achieve favorable rental rates on our new or renewing customer leases 

our growth is dependent on entering into new customer leases as well as renewing or reletting customer leases when existing customer leases terminate we face competition for site rental customers from various sources including 

 

  

  

  

 wireless carriers that own and operate their own tower portfolios are generally substantially larger and have greater financial resources than we have competition in our industry may make it more difficult for us to attract new customers maintain or increase our gross margins or maintain or increase our market share 

  

new technologies may significantly reduce demand for our towers and negatively impact our revenues 

improvements in the efficiency of wireless networks could reduce the demand for our towers for example signal combining technologies that permit one antenna to service multiple frequencies and thereby multiple customers may reduce the need for our towers in addition other technologies such as wireless mesh networks wifi femtocells satellite transmission systems such as low earth orbiting and distributed antenna systems may in the future serve as substitutes for or alternatives to leasing that might otherwise be anticipated or expected on our towers had such technologies not existed any significant reduction in tower leasing demand resulting from the previously mentioned technologies or other technologies may negatively impact our revenues or otherwise have a material adverse effect on us 

new wireless technologies may not deploy or be adopted by customers as rapidly or in the manner projected 

there can be no assurances that new wireless services and technologies such as 4g will be introduced or deployed as rapidly or in the manner projected by the wireless or broadcast industries in addition demand and customer adoption rates for such new technologies may be lower or slower than anticipated for numerous reasons as a result growth opportunities and demand for our towers as a result of such technologies may not be realized at the times or to the extent anticipated 

if we fail to retain rights to the land under our towers our business may be adversely affected 

our real property interests relating to the land on which our towers reside consist primarily of leasehold and subleasehold interests fee interests easements licenses and rightsofway a loss of these interests may interfere with our ability to conduct our business and generate revenues for various reasons we may not always have the ability to access analyze and verify all information regarding titles and other issues prior to completing an acquisition of towers further we may not be able to renew ground leases on commercially viable terms our ability to retain rights to the land on which our towers reside depends on our ability to purchase such land or to renegotiate and extend the terms of the leases relating to such land approximately 10 of our site rental gross margins for the year ended december 31 2009 are derived from towers where the leases for the land under such towers have final expiration dates of less than ten years if we are unable to retain rights to the land on which our towers reside may have a material adverse effect on us 

our network services business has historically experienced significant volatility in demand which reduces the predictability of our results 

the operating results of our network services business for any particular period may vary significantly and should not necessarily be considered indicative of longerterm results for this activity our network services business may be adversely impacted by various factors including competition economic weakness and uncertainty and changes in the type and volume of work performed and our market share 

if we fail to comply with laws or regulations which regulate our business and which may change at any time we may be fined or even lose our right to conduct some of our business 

a variety of federal state local and foreign laws and regulations apply to our business including those discussed in “item 1 business” failure to comply with applicable requirements may lead to civil penalties or require us to assume indemnification obligations or breach contractual provisions we cannot guarantee that existing or future laws or regulations including state and local tax laws will not adversely affect our business increase delays or result in additional costs these factors may have a material adverse effect on us 

if radio frequency emissions from wireless handsets or equipment on our towers are demonstrated to cause negative health effects potential future claims could adversely affect our operations costs and revenues 

the potential connection between radio frequency emissions and certain negative health effects including some forms of cancer has been the subject of substantial study by the scientific community in recent years we cannot guarantee that claims relating to radio frequency emissions will not arise in the future or that the results of such studies will not be adverse to us 

  

public perception of possible health risks associated with cellular and other wireless communications may slow or diminish the growth of wireless companies which may in turn slow or diminish our growth in particular negative public perception of and regulations regarding these perceived health risks may slow or diminish the market acceptance of wireless communications services if a connection between radio emissions and possible negative health effects were established our operations costs and revenues may be materially and adversely affected we currently do not maintain any significant insurance with respect to these matters 

certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation bylaws and operative agreements and domestic and international competition laws may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us or for us to acquire control of a third party even if such a change in control would be beneficial to our stockholders 

we have a number of antitakeover devices in place that will hinder takeover attempts and may reduce the market value of our common stock our antitakeover provisions include 

 

  

  

 our bylaws permit special meetings of the stockholders to be called only upon the request of our chief executive officer or a majority of the board of directors and deny stockholders the ability to call such meetings such provisions as well as the provisions of section 203 of the delaware general corporation law may impede a merger consolidation takeover or other business combination or discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us 

in addition domestic and international competition laws may prevent or discourage us from acquiring towers or tower networks in certain geographical areas or impede a merger consolidation takeover or other business combination or discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us 

we may be adversely effected by exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates relating to our operations in australia 

our australian operations expose us to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates for 2009 approximately 5 of our consolidated net revenues were denominated in australian dollars economic weakness and uncertainty has heightened the volatility of foreign currency exchange rates over the past two years we have not historically engaged in significant hedging activities relating to our australian operations and we may suffer future losses as a result of changes in currency exchange rates

 in addition to these principal offices ccusa leases and maintains area offices located in 1 charlotte north carolina 2 alpharetta georgia and 3 phoenix arizona which are in addition to the area office operated from our canonsburg pennsylvania corporate office the principal responsibilities of these area offices are to manage the renting of tower space on a local basis maintain the towers already located in the area and service our customers in the area in addition we lease additional smaller district offices which report to the area offices in locations with high tower concentrations 

towers are vertical metal structures generally ranging in height from 50 to 500 feet in addition wireless communications equipment may also be placed on building rooftops and other structures towers are generally located on tracts of land of up to five acres these tracts of land support the towers equipment shelters and where applicable guyed wires to stabilize the structure 

see “item 1 business—overview” for information regarding our tower portfolio including with respect to our real property interests and for a discussion of the location of our towers in the us and australia including the percentage of our us towers in the top 50 and 100 btas see “item 7 mda—liquidity and capital resources—contractual cash obligations” for a tabular presentation of the remaining terms to final expiration of the leases for the land which we do not own and on which our towers are located as of december 31 2009 

our tower revenue notes issued in 2010 and 2006 are effectively secured by approximately 6800 of our towers and the cash flows from those towers governing documents relating to another approximately 4900 towers prevent liens from being granted on those towers without approval of a subsidiary of verizon however distributions paid from the entities that own those towers will also service the tower revenue notes in addition approximately 1200 and 7900 of our towers and the cash flows derived from these towers are effectively pledged as security for our 2009 securitized notes and the 775 secured notes respectively see note 7 to our consolidated financial statements 

substantially all of our towers can accommodate another tenant either as currently constructed or with appropriate modifications to the tower additionally if so inclined as a result of customer demand we could generally also tear down an existing tower and reconstruct another tower in its place with additional capacity subject to certain restrictions as of december 31 2009 the average number of tenants per tower is approximately 29 on our towers the following is a summary of the number of existing tenants per tower as of december 31 2009 see “item 7 mda—accounting and reporting matters—critical accounting policies and estimates” for a discussion of our impairment evaluation and our towers with no tenants

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend general overview 

overview 

we own lease or manage approximately 24000 towers for wireless communications including the towers acquired in the global signal merger see note 3 to our consolidated financial statements revenues generated from our core site rental business represented 92 of our 2009 consolidated revenues ccusa our largest operating segment accounted for 95 of our 2009 site rental revenues of which 79 were derived from the four largest wireless carriers in the us our site rental revenues are of a recurring nature and typically in excess of 90 have been contracted for in a prior year see “item 1 business” for a further discussion of our business including certain key terms of our lease agreements 

the following are certain highlights of our business fundamentals as further discussed in this form 10k including in “item 1 business” and this mda  

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 our longterm strategy is to increase stockholder value by translating anticipated future growth in our core site rental business into growth in our results of operations on a per share basis the key elements of our strategy are see “item 1 business” for further discussion 

 

  

 our longterm strategy is based on our belief that opportunities will be created by the expected continued growth in the wireless communications industry which is predominately driven by the demand for wireless telephony and data services by consumers as a result of such expected growth in the wireless communications industry we believe that the demand for our towers will continue and result in organic growth of our revenues due to the colocation of additional tenants on our existing towers we expect that new tenant additions or modifications of existing installations collectively referred to as “tenant additions” on our towers should result in significant incremental cash flow due to the relatively fixed costs to operate a tower which tend to increase at approximately the rate of inflation certain of the growth trends in the wireless communications industry are discussed in “item 1 business—strategy” 

the following is a discussion of certain recent events which may impact our business and our strategy or the wireless communications industry 

 

  

   

  

  

  

  

 results of operations 

the following discussion of our results of operations should be read in conjunction with “item 1 business” “item 7 mda—liquidity and capital resources” and our consolidated financial statements the following discussion of our results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the us which require us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts see “item 7 mda—accounting and reporting matters—critical accounting policies and estimates” and note 2 to our consolidated financial statements

  2009 and 2008 our consolidated results of operations for 2009 and 2008 respectively predominately consist of our ccusa segment which accounted for 1 95 and 94 of consolidated net revenues 2 95 and 94 of consolidated gross margins and 3 101 and 79 of consolidated net income loss attributable to ccic stockholders our operating segment results for 2009 and 2008 including ccusa are discussed below see “item 7 mda—results of operations—comparison of operating segments”  

2008 and 2007 our consolidated results of operations for 2008 and 2007 respectively predominately consist of our ccusa segment which accounted for 1 94 and 94 of consolidated net revenues 2 94 and 94 of consolidated gross margins and 3 79 and 96 of consolidated net income loss attributable to ccic stockholders our operating segment results for 2008 and 2007 including ccusa are discussed below see “item 7 mda—results of operations—comparison of operating segments ” 

comparison of operating segments 

our reportable operating segments for 2009 are 1 ccusa primarily consisting of our us tower operations and 2 ccal our australian tower operations our financial results are reported to management and the board of directors in this manner 

  

see note 19 to our consolidated financial statements for segment results and a reconciliation of net income loss to adjusted ebitda defined below 

our measurement of profit or loss currently used to evaluate our operating performance and operating segments is earnings before interest taxes depreciation amortization and accretion as adjusted “adjusted ebitda” our measure of adjusted ebitda may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies including companies in the tower sector and is not a measure of performance calculated in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” 

we define adjusted ebitda as net income loss plus restructuring charges credits asset writedown charges acquisition and integration costs depreciation amortization and accretion interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs gains losses on purchases and redemptions of debt net gain loss on interest rate swaps impairment of availableforsale securities interest and other income expense benefit provision for income taxes cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle income loss from discontinued operations and stockbased compensation expense see note 14 to our consolidated financial statements the calculation of adjusted ebitda for our operating segments is set forth in note 19 to our consolidated financial statements adjusted ebitda is not intended as an alternative measure of operating results or cash flows from operations as determined in accordance with gaap and adjusted ebitda may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies adjusted ebitda is discussed further under “ item 7 mda — accounting and reporting matters—nongaap financial measures ” 

ccusa—2009 and 2008 net revenues for 2009 increased by 1630 million or 11 from 2008 this increase in net revenues resulted from an increase in site rental revenues of 1419 million or 11 for the same periods this increase in site rental revenues was impacted by the following items in no particular order new tenant additions across our entire portfolio inclusive of straightline accounting for certain lease escalations straightline accounting from renewal of customer leases escalations net of the impact of straightline accounting and cancellations of customer leases see “item 7 mda—accounting and reporting matters—critical accounting policies and estimates” for a further discussion of our revenue recognition policies tenant additions were influenced by the previously mentioned growth in the wireless communications industry although we continued to derive a large portion of our site rental revenues from the four largest wireless carriers in the us a significant portion of our new tenant additions were from second tier and emerging wireless customers such as those offering flat rate calling plans and wireless data only technologies such as clearwire a provider of wireless mobile internet services 

network services and other revenues for 2009 increased by 212 million or 19 from 2008 and the related gross margin increased by 101 million or 28 from 2008 the increase in network services and other revenues and the related gross margin reflects 1 the volatility and variable nature of the network services business as these revenues are not under longterm contract 2 as well as an increase in our market share for installations on our towers driven partially by our focus on delivering customer service and our emphasis on execution and expanding market share in the service business 

site rental gross margins for 2009 increased by 1413 million or 16 from 2008 the increase in the site rental gross margins was related to the previously mentioned 11 increase in site rental revenues site rental gross margins as a percentage of site rental revenues for 2009 increased by three percentage points from 2008 to 70 primarily as a result of the high incremental margins associated with tenant additions given the relatively fixed costs to operate a tower the 1413 million incremental margin represents 100 of the related increase in site rental revenues 

general and administrative expenses for 2009 increased by 77 million or 6 from 2008 general and administrative expenses are inclusive of stockbased compensation charges which increased by 33 million from 2008 to 2009 as discussed further in note 14 to our consolidated financial statements in addition to stockbased compensation the increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to the increase in salary and employee benefits including an increase in the annual bonus accrual due to 2009 performance and other nonrecurring expenses partially offset by the realization of certain cost management initiatives general and administrative expenses were 9 of net revenues for both 2009 and 2008 typically our general and administrative expenses do not significantly increase as a result of the colocation of additional tenants on our towers 

  

adjusted ebitda for 2009 increased by 1470 million or 18 from 2008 adjusted ebitda was positively impacted by the growth in our site rental business including the high incremental margin on the tenant additions 

depreciation amortization and accretion for 2009 increased by 32 million or less than 1 from 2008 the small increase is consistent with the movement in our fixed assets and intangible assets which did not materially change between 2008 and 2009 

during 2009 we repaid or purchased 23 billion of face value debt using cash from our issuances of debt in order to extend and ladder the maturities of our debt portfolio as a result of purchasing and early retiring certain of our debt we incurred a net loss of 911 million for 2009 inclusive of make whole payments the increase in interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs of 926 million or 26 in 2009 resulted predominately from our total debt increasing by 4626 million and the impact of completing the refinancings at a higher weightedaverage cost of debt the refinancing of the 2006 mortgage loan did not qualify for hedge accounting as the actual refinancing was not consistent with that anticipated as part of hedge accounting which resulted in discontinuing hedge accounting and reclassifying 1329 million from accumulated other comprehensive income “aoci” to earnings during 2009 this loss was partially offset by gains on interest rate swaps that resulted from a decrease in the liability for those swaps not subject to hedge accounting for a further discussion of the debt refinancings and the interest rate swaps see notes 7 and 8 to our consolidated financial statements “item 7 mda—liquidity and capital resources” and “item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  ” 

in 2008 we recorded a noncash impairment charge of 559 million related to a decline in the fair value of our investment in fibertower that was deemed to be otherthantemporary any potential future writedowns are limited to the carrying value of our investment of 42 million as of december 31 2009 

benefit provision for income taxes for 2009 was a benefit of 777 million compared to 1066 million for 2008 the benefit for income taxes for 2009 is inclusive of a 206 million reversal of state tax valuation allowances the effective tax rate for 2009 differs from the federal statutory rate due predominately to these state tax benefits the effective tax rate for 2008 differs from the federal statutory rate predominately due to income tax benefits resulting from the completion of the irs examination and a full valuation allowance on our unrealized capital losses from our investment in fibertower as of december 31 2009 we are limited to recognizing approximately 15 million of future federal tax benefits since we currently expect that other additional benefits would have a full valuation allowance because our history of tax operating losses prevents us from determining that it is more likely than not that we may not realize such benefits see note 10 to our consolidated financial statements 

net income loss attributable to ccic stockholders for 2009 was a loss of 1154 million inclusive of 1 net losses from repayments and purchases and early retirement of debt of 911 million and 2 net losses from interest rate swaps of 930 million net income loss attributable to ccic stockholders for 2008 was a loss of 384 million inclusive of 1 noncash impairment charges of 559 million related to our investment in fibertower 2 losses on the change in the fair value of certain interest rate swaps of 379 million and 3 tax benefits of 749 million resulting from the completion of an irs examination the increase in net loss was predominately due to 1 the previously mentioned charges and benefits 2 the previously mentioned increase in interest expense of 926 million and are partially offset by 3 growth in our core site rental business 

ccal—2009 and 2008 the increases and decreases between 2009 and 2008 are inclusive of exchange rate fluctuations the average exchange rate of australian dollars to us dollars for 2009 was approximately 079 a decrease of 7 from approximately 085 for the same period in the prior year see “item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” 

total net revenues for 2009 decreased by 41 million or 5 from 2008 site rental revenues for 2009 decreased by 12 million or 2 from 2008 the decrease in the exchange rate negatively impacted net revenues and site rental revenues by approximately 65 million and 59 million respectively and accounted for a decline of 7 and 8 respectively for 2009 from 2008 site rental revenues were also impacted by various other factors including in no particular order new tenant additions on our towers straightline accounting from renewal of customer leases escalations net of the impact of straightline accounting and cancellations of customer leases net revenues were also impacted by a 29 million decrease in network services and other revenues the decrease in network services and other revenues reflects the quarterly volatility and variable nature of the network services business as these revenues are not under longterm contract see “item 1 business—the company—ccal” 

  

adjusted ebitda for 2009 decreased by 09 million or 2 from 2008 adjusted ebitda was negatively impacted by the exchange rate fluctuations site rental gross margins decreased by 11 million or 2 for 2009 from 547 million while site rental gross margin as a percentage of site rental revenues was 70 for both periods 

net income loss attributable to ccic stockholders for 2009 was net income of 11 million compared to a net loss of 105 million for 2008 the change from net loss to net income was primarily driven by a decrease in interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs of 97 million the majority of which was due to a decrease in the variable interest rate of our intercompany debt 

ccusa—2008 and 2007 net revenues for 2008 increased by 1334 million or 10 from 2007 this increase in net revenues resulted from an increase in site rental revenues of 1097 million or 9 for the same periods this increase in site rental revenues was driven primarily by 82 million from new tenant additions across our entire portfolio inclusive of the impact of straightline accounting for certain lease escalators in addition to new tenant additions our site rental revenues are influenced by various factors including in no particular order 1 escalations net of the impact of straight line accounting 2 impact of straight line accounting from renewal of customer leases 3 new towers acquired or constructed 4 a full year of revenues from our spectrum lease and 5 cancelation of customer leases see “item 7 mda—accounting and reporting matters—critical accounting policies and estimates” for a further discussion of our revenue recognition policies tenant additions were influenced by the previously mentioned growth in the wireless communications industry we continued to derive a large portion of our site rental revenues and new tenant additions from the four largest carriers in the us in addition to the four largest carriers our 2008 net revenues and new tenant additions were also derived from second tier and emerging wireless customers such as those offering flat rate calling plans and wireless data technologies 

network services and other revenues for 2008 increased by 237 million or 26 from 2007 the increase in network services and other revenues was as a result of performing services on a larger portfolio of towers due to the global signal merger global signal did not operate a network services business so the network services and other revenues performed on the global signal towers increased during 2007 and 2008 as we began marketing services for those towers the network services business is typically nonrecurring and the volume of activity can vary significantly from period to period in relation to tenant additions on our towers 

site rental gross margins for 2008 increased by 983 million or 12 from 2007 the increase in site rental gross margins was related to the previously mentioned 9 increase in site rental revenues primarily driven by tenant additions site rental gross margins as a percentage of site rental revenues for 2008 increased by two percentage points from 2007 to 67 primarily as a result of the high incremental margins associated with tenant additions given the relatively fixed costs to operate a tower the 983 million incremental margin represents 90 of the related increase in site rental revenues 

general and administrative expenses for 2008 increased by 73 million or 6 from 2007 but decreased to 9 of total net revenues from 10 of total net revenues over the same period general and administrative expenses are inclusive of stockbased compensation charges as discussed further in note 14 to our consolidated financial statements the increase in general and administrative expenses was due primarily to the increase in stockbased compensation typically our general and administrative expenses do not significantly increase as a result of the colocation of additional tenants on our towers as indicated by the decrease in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues from 2007 to 2008 

adjusted ebitda for 2008 increased by 1029 million or 14 from 2007 adjusted ebitda was positively impacted by the growth in our site rental business including the high incremental margin on the tenant additions 

acquisition and integration costs for 2008 were 25 million compared to 254 million in 2007 the decrease resulted from the completion of the integration of the global signal tower portfolio during the first quarter of 2008 see notes 3 and 20 to our consolidated financial statements 

depreciation amortization and accretion for 2008 decreased by 136 million or 3 from 2007 the decrease resulted from towers acquired from global signal with short useful lives as defined by gaap that were fully depreciated at december 31 2007 our tower assets are recorded at cost estimated replacement cost for those acquired and are depreciated using a useful life that is defined as the period equal to the shorter of 20 years or the term of the underlying ground lease including renewal options see “item 7 mda—accounting and reporting matters—critical accounting policies and estimates” 

  

interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs for 2008 increased by 43 million or 1 from 2007 we made no material changes in our indebtedness during 2007 and 2008 other than the mortgage loans 18 billion that remained outstanding as obligations after the global signal merger on january 11 2007 and the issuance of term loans 6500 million in january and march 2007 our weightedaverage interest rate for 2008 was relatively consistent with 2007 as a result of virtually all of our debt having fixed rate coupons see “item 7 mda—liquidity and capital resources—overview  ” 

in 2007 and 2008 we recorded noncash impairment charges of 756 million and 559 million respectively related to declines in the fair value of our investment in fibertower that was deemed otherthantemporary any potential future writedowns are limited to the carrying value of our investment of 42 million as of december 31 2008 see note 6 to our consolidated financial statements 

benefit provision for income taxes for 2008 was a benefit of 1066 million compared to 953 million for 2007 the tax benefits for 2008 include tax benefits of 749 million resulting from the completion of the irs examination of our us federal tax return for 2004 the effective tax rate for 2008 differs from the federal statutory rate due predominately to income tax benefits resulting from the completion of the irs examination and a full valuation allowance on our unrealized capital losses from our investment in fibertower see note 10 to our consolidated financial statements 

net income loss attributable to ccic stockholders for 2008 was a loss of 384 million inclusive of 1 noncash impairment charges of 559 million related to our investment in fibertower 2 losses on the change in fair value of certain interest rate swaps of 379 million and 3 tax benefits of 749 million resulting from the completion of an irs examination net loss for 2007 was 2149 million inclusive of 1 a noncash impairment charge of 756 million related to our investment in fibertower 2 the asset writedown and restructuring charges related to modeo totaling 607 million and 3 acquisition and integration costs related to the global signal merger of 254 million the improvement in net loss was predominately due to the incremental gross margin in our site rental business of 983 million and the impact of the previously mentioned charges and benefits 

ccal—2008 and 2007 the increases and decreases between 2007 and 2008 are inclusive of exchange rate fluctuations the average exchange rate of australian dollars to us dollars for 2008 was approximately 085 an increase of 2 from approximately 084 for the same period in the prior year see “item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” 

total net revenues for 2008 increased by 76 million or 9 from 2007 the increase in total net revenues was influenced by various factors including tenant additions on our towers and towers acquired after the third quarter of 2007 network services and other revenues and tenant additions were influenced by the continued development of several 3g networks in australia see “item 1 business—the company—ccal” 

adjusted ebitda for 2008 increased by 56 million or 14 from 2007 adjusted ebitda was positively impacted by the same factors that drove the increase in site rental revenues more specifically site rental gross margins increased by 50 million or 10 for 2008 from 497 million in the prior year the 50 million incremental margin represents 78 of the related increase in site rental revenues 

net income loss attributable to ccic stockholders for 2008 was a net loss of 105 million an increase in net loss of 26 million from 2007 the increase in net loss was primarily driven by a 89 million increase in interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs resulting predominately from an intercompany borrowing between segments partially offset by the growth in the site rental business the proceeds of the intercompany borrowing were primarily utilized to fund the capital return in may 2007 in order to increase the leverage of the ccal business 

impact of inflation other than the towers acquired from global signal the majority of our towers were acquired between 1999 and 2001 tower assets and related depreciation expense do not reflect the impact of inflation occurring subsequent to the acquisition of these towers the impact of inflation has not historically had a significant impact on our results of operations including with respect to each of the years presented herein 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

overview 

general our site rental business is generally characterized by a stable cash flow stream generated by revenues under longterm contracts that should be recurring for the foreseeable future over the last five years our cash from operations have exceeded our cash interest payments and sustaining capital expenditures and provided us with cash available for discretionary investments we seek to allocate the cash produced by our operations in a manner that will enhance per share operating results cash flows from our site rental operations grew in 2009 and we expect that trend to continue over the longterm our cash interest expense is expected to increase in 2010 as a result of our debt issuances during 2009 and the beginning of 2010 given the conditions in the credit markets during 2009 we limited our discretionary investments including a reduction in discretionary capital expenditures in order to increase liquidity available to retire debt and settle certain of our interest rate swaps during 2010 we expect to increase our investment of our available cash in discretionary investments such as those discussed in “ item 1 business—strategy ” 

liquidity position the following is a summary of our capitalization and liquidity position see “item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” and notes 7 and 9 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our debt 

 

  

   in addition to cash on hand and undrawn revolver availability we expect to generate between 575 million to 625 million of cash flows from operating activities over the next 12 months as ccic is a holding company this cash flow from operations is generated by our operating subsidiaries 

recent events in light of the economic weakness and the current challenging credit markets we have taken the following actions to manage our debt maturities and build liquidity with cash flows from operations 

 

  

   

as a result of these actions approximately 70 of our debt outstanding as of january 31 2010 was issued during 2009 and the beginning of 2010 over the next twelve months we have no debt maturing other than nominal principal payments on amortizing debt we plan on endeavoring to refinance the 2006 tower revenue notes on or before their anticipated repayment date in november 2011 our ability to obtain borrowings that are securitized by tower cash flows and are at commercially reasonable terms will depend on various factors such as our ability to generate cash flows on our existing towers the state of the capital markets and other factors such as those in “item 1a risk factors” if we are unable to refinance our debt with similar instruments we may explore other forms of financing which may include other forms of debt or issuances of equity or equity related securities 

our tower revenue notes totaling 32 billion have final maturities ranging from 2035 to 2040 and anticipated repayment dates of november 2011 for the 155 billion 2006 tower revenue notes and between 2015 and 2020 for the 2010 tower revenue notes if our tower revenue notes are not repaid in full by their anticipated repayment dates then the interest rates increase by approximately 5 per annum to approximately 11 and substantially all of the cash flows of the subsidiaries issuing the tower revenue notes “excess cash flow” as defined in the tower revenue notes indenture will be used to repay principal excess cash flow of the issuers of the tower revenue notes was approximately 375 million for full year 2009 representing approximately twothirds of our annualized consolidated cash flows from operations for 2009 should we not repay our tower revenue notes by their anticipated repayment dates we anticipate having sufficient liquidity to operate our existing business with no impact on our operations see “item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” for a tabular presentation of our debt maturities as of december 31 2009 pro forma for the issuance of the 2010 tower revenue notes and the repayment and purchases of debt in january 2010 

longterm strategy we seek to maintain a capital structure that we believe drives longterm shareholder value and optimizes our weightedaverage cost of capital over the long term we target leverage of approximately five times adjusted ebitda and interest coverage of approximately three times adjusted ebitda subject to various factors such as the availability and cost of capital and the potential longterm return on our discretionary investments in furtherance of this longterm strategy we contemplate funding our discretionary investments primarily with operating cash flows and in certain instances potential future debt financings and issuances of equity or equity related securities as a result anticipated future growth in site rental cash flows and corresponding increases in adjusted ebitda should reduce our leverage conversely as our cash flows and adjusted ebitda grow we may seek to increase our debt in nominal dollars to maintain or achieve a certain targeted leverage 

summary cash flows information 

 

 operating activities 

the increase in net cash provided by operating activities for 2009 from 2008 and 2007 was due primarily to the growth in our core site rental business we expect net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december 31 2010 will increase from the year ended december 31 2009 primarily as a result of our anticipated growth in our core site rental business partially offset by higher cash interest expense changes in working capital and particularly changes in deferred rental revenues prepaid ground leases and accrued interest can have a significant impact on our net cash from operating activities from period to period largely due to the timing of payments and receipts 

we pay minimal cash income taxes as a result of generating taxable losses and our usage of net operating loss carryforwards despite our history of taxable operating losses we expect to generate taxable income in the future to ultimately realize our federal operating loss of 18 billion and begin to pay substantial federal income taxes in roughly seven years based on current projections 

  

investing activities 

capital expenditures our capital expenditures can be generally categorized as sustaining or discretionary sustaining capital expenditures include capitalized costs related to 1 maintenance activities on our towers which are generally related to replacements and upgrades that extend the life of the asset 2 vehicles 3 information technology equipment and 4 office equipment discretionary capital expenditures which we also commonly refer to as “revenuegenerating capital expenditures” include 1 purchases of land under towers 2 tower improvements in order to support additional site rentals 3 the construction or purchase of towers and 4 the construction of distributed antenna systems 

a summary of our capital expenditures for the last three years is as follows 

 

 as previously mentioned during 2009 we reduced our capital expenditures from our 2008 levels in order to increase liquidity available to retire debt and settle certain of our interest rate swaps these reductions included reductions of our purchases of land construction and purchase of towers our decisions regarding discretionary capital expenditures are influenced by the availability and cost of capital and expected returns on alternative investments the following is a discussion of certain aspects of our capital expenditures 

 

  

 acquisition of global signal see notes 3 and 20 to our consolidated financial statements 

financing activities 

in light of the current challenges in the credit markets and consistent with our previously mentioned strategy to prudently manage liquidity our financing activities for 2008 and 2009 included purchases of common stock at reduced levels from our past practices and a reduction in our relative leverage however we are still committed to our longterm strategy to allocate our capital to drive longterm stockholder value which may include making discretionary investments such as purchases of our debt and common stock 

  

the following is a summary of the significant financing transactions completed in 2009 which are obligations of ccic or are guaranteed by ccic as holding companies unless they obtain other forms of financing ccic and ccoc require distributions or dividends from subsidiaries or the use of their cash on hand to fund their obligations see also note 7 to our consolidated financial statements

credit agreement in january 2007 ccoc entered into a credit agreement that provided a senior secured revolving credit facility that is guaranteed by ccic in december 2009 we amended the revolving credit facility to extend the maturity until september 2013 and increase the total revolving commitment to 4000 million as of december 31 2009 the revolving credit facility was undrawn availability of the revolving credit facility at any time is determined by certain financial ratios we may use the availability under the revolving credit facility for general corporate purposes which may include the financing of capital expenditures acquisitions and purchases of our common or preferred stock the revolving credit facility bears interest at prime rate or libor plus a credit spread based on our consolidated leverage ratio 

the following is a summary of significant financing transactions completed in 2009 and the beginning of 2010 that are obligations of subsidiaries of ccic and which are not obligations of or guaranteed by ccic see also note 7 to our consolidated financial statements 

775 secured notes in april 2009 we issued 12 billion principal amount of 775 secured notes due 2017 the 775 secured notes are obligations of the subsidiaries that held a portion of the us towers acquired in the global signal merger and that were previously obligated under the 2006 mortgage loan the 775 secured notes will be paid solely from the cash flows generated from operations of the towers held directly and indirectly by the issuers and the guarantors of such notes these 775 secured notes bear interest at a rate of 775 per annum payable quarterly beginning on august 1 2009 we received proceeds of 115 billion net of fees and discounts from the 775 secured notes offering as discussed herein we have used the net proceeds together with existing cash balances to repay the portion of our 2006 mortgage loan not previously purchased see also note 7 to our consolidated financial statements

the 2009 securitized notes consist of two tranches that amortize during the period beginning in january 2010 and ending in 2019 and the period beginning in 2019 and ending in 2029 respectively the life of the 2009 securitized notes is substantially longer than the five year balloon maturities that we previously obtained in the securitization market which is due in part to the longer remaining current term of our customer leases the 2009 securitized debt was rated investment grade with tranche ratings of a2 and a3 from moody’s and a from fitch 

2010 tower revenue notes in january 2010 we issued 19 billion principal amount of 2010 tower revenue notes at a weightedaverage rate of 575 pursuant to the indenture governing the existing tower revenue notes we received proceeds of 19 billion net of fees we have used the net proceeds to repay the portion of our 2005 tower revenue notes not previously purchased 

  

the 2010 tower revenue notes consist of three series of 3000 million 3500 million and 125 billion principal amount with anticipated repayments dates of 2015 2017 and 2020 respectively the weightedaverage life of the 2010 tower revenue notes is substantially longer than the five year anticipated life of the prior tower revenue notes which is due in part to the longer remaining current term of our customer leases all three series of the 2010 tower revenue notes were rated investment grade a2 from moody’s and a from fitch beginning with our anticipated refinancing of the 2006 tower revenue notes we may separate the collateral underlying the tower revenue notes subject to certain provisions including rating agency confirmation which should increase flexibility with respect to any potential future refinancing of the 2006 tower revenue notes 

debt purchases and repayments see notes 7 and 23 to our consolidated financial statements for a summary of our purchases and repayments of debt during 2009 and 2010 respectively including the gains losses on purchases and repayments in january 2010 we refinanced our 2005 tower revenue notes and purchased portions of our 9 senior notes 775 secured notes and 2009 securitized notes which resulted in an aggregate loss of 628 million 

common stock activity as of december 31 2009 2008 and 2007 we had 2927 million 2885 million and 2825 million common shares outstanding respectively we may purchase our common stock in the future as we seek to allocate capital to discretionary investments in a manner that will enhance per share results see “item 1 business—strategy” 

preferred stock dividends we have the option to pay dividends on our 625 convertible preferred stock in cash or shares of common stock valued at 95 of the current market value of the common stock as defined see “item 5 market for registrant’s common equity related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities”  since 2005 we have elected to pay the dividends in cash and expect to continue to do so for the foreseeable future we are required to redeem all outstanding shares of our 625 convertible preferred stock on august 15 2012 at a price equal to the liquidation preference plus accumulated and unpaid dividends the shares of 625 convertible preferred stock are convertible at the option of the holder in whole or in part at any time into shares of common stock at a conversion price of 36875 per share of common stock under certain circumstances we generally have the right to convert the 625 convertible preferred stock in whole or in part into 86 million shares of common stock if the price per share of our common stock equals or exceeds 120 of the conversion price or 4425 for at least 20 trading days in any consecutive 30day trading period 

interest rate swaps we enter into interest rate swaps to manage and reduce our interest rate risk including the use of interest rate swaps to hedge the variability in cash flows from changes in libor on anticipated refinancing and outstanding variable rate debt see “item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” and note 8 to our consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of our use of interest rate swaps including the potential impact on our cash obligations and our earnings and information concerning interest rate swaps that no longer represent economic hedges 

restricted cash  pursuant to the indenture governing our operating companies’ debt all rental cash receipts of the issuers of these debt instruments and their subsidiaries are restricted and held by an indenture trustee the restricted cash in excess of required reserve balances is subsequently released to us in accordance with the terms of the indentures see also notes 2 and 7 to our consolidated financial statements 

  

contractual cash obligations 

the following table summarizes our contractual cash obligations as of december 31 2009 1 with the exception of interest rate swaps which are as of january 31 2010 and 2 after giving effect to the refinancing of the 2005 tower revenue notes and purchases of debt in january 2010 these contractual cash obligations relate primarily to our outstanding borrowings and ground lease obligations the debt maturities reflect contractual maturity dates and do not consider the impact of the principal payments that will commence following the anticipated repayment dates on the tower revenue notes see footnote b 

 

  

  

  

  

  

        

the following table summarizes as of december 31 2009 the remaining terms to expiration including renewal terms at our option of 1 the leases for the land on which approximately 17600 of our towers reside and 2 agreements to manage approximately 700 towers owned by third parties where we had sublease agreements with the tower owner in addition we own in fee or have perpetual or longterm easements in the land on which approximately 5700 of our towers reside 24 of total towers and 31 of our site rental gross margin as of december 31 2009 see “ item 1a risk factors ” 

 

  

  debt covenants 

our debt obligations contain certain financial covenants with which ccic or our subsidiaries must maintain compliance in order to avoid the imposition of certain restrictions various of our debt obligations also place other restrictions on ccic or our subsidiaries including the ability to incur debt and liens purchase our securities make capital expenditures dispose of assets undertake transactions with affiliates make other investments and pay dividends we are permitted to issue additional indebtedness at ccic and at our operating subsidiaries if no covenant violations occur including the below mentioned restrictive covenants and certain other requirements are met which may include rating agency confirmations see note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our debt covenants 

factors that are likely to determine our subsidiaries’ ability to comply with their current and future debt covenants include their 1 financial performance 2 levels of indebtedness and 3 debt service requirements given the current level of indebtedness of our subsidiaries the primary risk of a debt covenant violation would be from a deterioration of a subsidiary’s financial performance should a covenant violation occur in the future as a result of a shortfall in financial performance or for any other reason we might be required to make principal payments earlier than currently scheduled and may not have access to additional borrowings under these facilities as long as the covenant violation continues any such early principal payments would have to be made from our existing cash balances or cash from operations if our operating subsidiaries were to default on the debt the trustee could seek to pursue the collateral securing the debt in which case we could lose the towers and the future revenues associated with the towers we currently have no financial covenant violations and based upon our current expectations we believe our operating results will be sufficient to comply with our debt covenants over the near and longterm see “item 1a risk factors” 

the financial maintenance covenants under our debt agreements exclusive of cash trap reserve covenants are as follows 

 

  

     

the following are the ratios applicable to the cash trap reserve covenants under our debt agreements that could require the cash flows generated by the issuers and their subsidiaries to be deposited in a reserve account and not released to us 

 

  

   the 9 senior notes and 7125 senior notes contain restrictive covenants with which we and our restricted subsidiaries must comply subject to a number of exceptions and qualifications including restrictions on our ability to incur incremental debt issue preferred stock guarantee debt pay dividends repurchase our capital stock use assets as security in other transactions sell assets or merge with or into other companies and make certain investments certain of these covenants are not applicable if there is no event of default and if the ratio of our consolidated debt as defined in the senior notes indenture and to our adjusted consolidated cash flows as defined in the senior notes indenture is less than 70 to 1 as of january 31 2010 such restrictions were not applicable because there has been no event of default and our ratio of consolidated debt to adjusted consolidated cash flows is less than 70 to 1 and based on our estimates of consolidated debt to adjusted consolidated cash flows and our current indebtedness we do not expect such restrictions to be applicable the 9 senior notes and 7125 senior notes do not contain any financial maintenance covenants

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the following is a discussion of the accounting policies and estimates that we believe 1 are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and 2 require our most difficult subjective or complex judgments often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain the critical accounting policies and estimates for 2009 are not intended to be a comprehensive list of our accounting policies and estimates see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for a summary of our significant accounting policies in many cases the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by gaap with no need for management’s judgment in other cases management is required to exercise judgment in the application of accounting principles with respect to particular transactions 

revenue recognition site rental revenues are recognized on a monthly basis over the fixed noncancelable term of the relevant lease or agreement with terms generally ranging from five to 15 years in accordance with applicable accounting standards these revenues are recognized on a monthly basis regardless of whether the payments from the customer are received in equal monthly amounts if the payment terms call for fixed escalations as in fixed dollar or fixed percentage increases or rent free periods the effect is recognized on a straightline basis over the fixed noncancelable term of the agreement when calculating our straightline rental revenues we consider all fixed elements of tenant leases escalation provisions even if such escalation provisions also include a variable element as a result of recognizing revenue on a straightline basis a portion of the revenue in a given 

  

period represents cash collected or contractually collectible in other periods we record an allowance for uncollectible deferred site rental revenues for which increases or reversals of this allowance impact our site rental revenues see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements 

to a lesser extent we provide network services such as antenna installations and subsequent augmentation network design and site selection site acquisition services site development and other services network services revenues are generally recognized using the completed contract method under the completed contract method revenues and costs for a particular project are recognized in total at the completion date when using the completed contract method of accounting for network services revenues we must accurately determine the completion date for the project in order to record the revenues and costs in the proper period for antenna installations we consider the project complete when the customer can begin transmitting its signal through the antenna although we don’t typically incur losses on our network services because we typically enter into costplus profit contracts we must also be able to estimate losses on uncompleted contracts as such losses must be recognized as soon as they are known we use the completed contract method for our network services projects because our projects have a short duration generally less than one year we do not believe that our use of the completed contract method for network services projects produces financial position and operating results that differ substantially from the percentageofcompletion method 

some of our arrangements with our customers call for the performance of multiple revenuegenerating activities and typically would include both site rental and network services however we do not always provide the antenna installation services on our towers as the customer may obtain a third party to complete these services in cases where we do perform the antenna installation on our towers we determine whether the multiple deliverables are to be accounted for separately or on a combined basis in order to be accounted for separately the undelivered items must 1 have standalone value to the customer 2 have reliably determinable fair value on a separate basis and 3 have delivery which is probable and under our control in addition the delivered item must have standalone value to the customer allocation of recognized revenue in such arrangements is based on the relative fair value of the separately delivered items we have generally determined that it is appropriate to account for antenna installation activities separately from the customer’s subsequent site rentals 

accounting for longlived assets — valuation as of december 31 2009 our largest asset was our telecommunications towers representing approximately 41 billion or 84 of our 49 billion in net book value of property and equipment followed by intangible assets and goodwill approximately 24 billion and 20 billion in net book value respectively resulting predominately from the global signal merger in 2007 and other acquisitions of large tower portfolios the vast majority approximately 23 billion net book value at december 31 2009 of our identifiable intangibles relate to the site rental contracts and customer relationships intangible assets see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the nature and composition of the site rental contracts and customer relationships intangible assets 

we allocate the purchase price of acquisitions to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair value at the date of acquisition any purchase price in excess of the net fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is allocated to goodwill in the case of the global signal merger we paid a purchase price that resulted in goodwill for two primary reasons 1 as a strategic measure to ensure that we maintained a tower portfolio of a comparable size to our largest competitor and 2 to deliver the needed control premium necessary to effect the transaction the fair value of the vast majority of our assets and liabilities is determined by using either 

 

  

 the purchase price allocation requires subjective estimates that if incorrectly estimated could be material to our consolidated financial statements including the amount of depreciation amortization and accretion expense the most important estimates for measurement of tangible fixed assets are 1 the cost to replace the asset with a new asset and 2 the economic useful life after giving effect to age quality and condition the most important estimates for measurement of intangible assets are 1 discount rates and 2 timing and amount of cash flows including estimates regarding customer renewals and cancelations the determination of the final purchase price allocation could extend over several quarters resulting in the use of preliminary estimates that are subject to adjustment until finalized 

  

we record the fair value of obligations to perform certain asset retirement activities including requirements pursuant to our ground leases to remove towers or remediate the land upon which our towers reside in determining the fair value of these asset retirement obligations we must make several subjective and highly judgmental estimates such as those related to 1 timing of cash flows 2 future costs and 3 discount rates see notes 2 and 17 to our consolidated financial statements 

accounting for longlived assets — useful lives we are required to make subjective assessments as to the useful lives of our tangible and intangible assets for purposes of determining depreciation amortization and accretion expense that if incorrectly estimated could be material to our consolidated financial statements depreciation expense for our property and equipment is computed using the straightline method over the estimated useful lives of our various classes of tangible assets the substantial portion of our property and equipment represents the cost of our towers which is depreciated with an estimated useful life equal to the shorter of 1 20 years or 2 the term of the lease including optional renewals for the land under the tower 

the useful life of our intangible assets are estimated based on the period over which the intangible asset is expected to benefit us and gives consideration to the expected useful life of other assets to which the useful life may relate amortization expense for intangible assets is computed using the straightline method over the estimated useful life of each of the intangible assets the useful life of the site rental contracts and customer relationships intangible assets is limited by the maximum depreciable life of the tower 20 years as a result of the interdependency of the tower and site rental contracts and customer relationships in contrast the site rental contracts and customer relationships are estimated to provide economic benefits for several decades because of the low rate of customer cancellations and high rate of renewals experienced to date thus while site rental contracts and customer relationships are valued based upon the fair value of the site rental contracts and customer relationships which includes assumptions regarding both 1 customers’ exercise of optional renewals contained in the acquired contracts and 2 renewals of the acquired contracts past the contractual term including exercisable options the site rental contracts are amortized over a period not to exceed 20 years as a result of the useful life being limited by the depreciable life of the tower 

accounting for longlived assets — impairment evaluation — intangibles we review the carrying values of property and equipment intangible assets and other longlived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable we utilize the following dual grouping policy for purposes of determining the unit of account for testing impairment of the site rental contracts and customer relationships 

 

  

 we first pool site rental contracts and customer relationships intangible assets and property and equipment into portfolio groups for purposes of determining the unit of account for impairment testing because we view towers as portfolios and a tower in a given portfolio and its related customer contracts are not largely independent of the other towers in the portfolio we reevaluate the appropriateness of the pooled groups at least annually this use of grouping is based in part on 1 our limitations regarding disposal of towers 2 the interdependencies of tower portfolios and 3 the manner in which towers are traded in the marketplace the vast majority of our site rental contracts and customer relationships intangible assets and property and equipment are pooled into the us owned tower group secondly and separately we pool site rental contracts and customer relationships by significant customer or by customer grouping for individually insignificant customers as appropriate for purposes of determining the unit of account for impairment testing because we associate the value ascribed to site rental contracts and customer relationships intangible assets to the underlying contracts and related customer relationships acquired 

our determination that an adverse event or change in circumstance has occurred that indicates that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable will generally involve 1 a deterioration in an asset’s financial performance compared to historical results 2 a shortfall in an asset’s financial performance compared to forecasted results or 3 changes affecting the utility of the asset when considering the utility of our assets we consider events that would meaningfully impact 1 our towers or 2 our customer relationships for example consideration would be 

  

given to events that impact 1 the structural integrity and longevity of our towers or 2 our ability to derive benefit from our existing customer relationships including events such as bankruptcy or insolvency or loss of a significant customer during 2009 there were no events or circumstances that caused us to review the carrying value of our intangible assets and property and equipment due in part to our assets performing consistently with or better than our expectations 

if the sum of the estimated future cash flows undiscounted from an asset or portfolio group significant customer or customer group for individually insignificant customers as applicable is less than its carrying amount an impairment loss is recognized if the carrying value were to exceed the undiscounted cash flows measurement of an impairment loss would be based on the fair value of the asset which would generally be based on an estimate of discounted future cash flows the most important estimates for such calculations of undiscounted cash flows are 1 the expected additions of new tenants and equipment on our towers and 2 estimates regarding customer cancelations and renewals of contracts we could record impairments in the future if changes in longterm market conditions expected future operating results or the utility of the assets results in changes for our impairment test calculations which negatively impact the fair value of our property and equipment and intangible assets or if we changed our unit of account in the future 

when grouping assets into pools for purposes of impairment evaluation we also consider individual towers within a grouping for which we currently have no tenants approximately 2 of our total towers currently have no tenants we continue to pay operating expenses on these towers in anticipation of obtaining tenants on these towers in the future primarily because of the individual tower site demographics in fact we have current visibility to potential tenants on roughly twothirds of these towers to the extent we do not believe there are longterm prospects of obtaining tenants on an individual tower and all other possible avenues for recovering the carrying value of the tower have been exhausted including sale of the tower we appropriately reduce the carrying value of such towers 

accounting for longlived assets — impairment evaluation — goodwill all of our goodwill is recorded at ccusa we test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis regardless of whether adverse events or changes in circumstances have occurred the annual test begins with goodwill and all intangible assets being allocated to applicable reporting units goodwill is then tested using a twostep process that begins with an estimation of fair value of the reporting unit using an income approach which looks to the present value of expected future cash flows the first step commonly referred to as a “step one impairment test” is a screen for potential impairment while the second step measures the amount of impairment if there is an indication from the first step that one exists our reporting units are the operating segments since segment management operates their respective tower portfolios as a single network our measurement of the fair value for goodwill is based on an estimate of discounted future cash flows of the reporting unit the most important estimates for such calculations are 1 expected additions of new tenants and equipment on our towers 2 estimates regarding customer cancellations and renewal of customer contracts 3 the terminal multiple for our projected cash flows 4 our weightedaverage cost of capital 5 and control premium 

on october 1 2009 we performed our annual goodwill impairment test the results of this test indicated that goodwill was not impaired at either of our reporting units the fair value of our net assets as measured by our market capitalization was almost four times greater than the aggregate carrying amount of the reporting units as of december 31 2009 although we currently are not at risk of failing a step one impairment test a future change in our reporting units unit of account or assumptions surrounding the most important estimates included in our impairment test could result in the recognition of an impairment 

interest rate swaps we enter into interest rate swaps to manage and reduce our interest rate risk the designation of our interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges requires judgment including with respect to the required assessment of the effectiveness of hedging relationships both at inception and on an ongoing basis we have designated certain of our interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges which as of december 31 2009 consists of certain interest rate swaps hedging the tower revenue notes the effective portion of changes in fair value of interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges is recorded in aoci and is recognized in earnings when the hedged item affects earnings in contrast the change in fair value of interest rate swaps related to hedge ineffectiveness and for those not designated as cash flow hedges is immediately marked to market in earnings 

  

in assessing effectiveness of our forwardstarting swaps both at inception and on an ongoing basis we must make several highly subjective and judgmental estimates such as assessing 1 those related to the timing amount nature and probability of these future expected refinancings and 2 whether it is probable that the counterparties to our swaps will not default the state of the current credit markets makes these estimates regarding future refinancings especially difficult as of december 31 2009 we have estimated that it is probable the expected refinancing of both the 2005 tower revenue notes and 2006 tower revenue notes will occur see below regarding the january 2010 refinancing of the 2005 tower revenue notes following completion of the refinancing of the 2005 tower revenue notes we may change our assessment of the future expected refinancing of the 2006 tower revenue notes including a reduction in expected principal amount as a result we may prospectively discontinue hedge accounting or reclassify some or all of the unrealized loss from aoci into earnings during 2010 

although the 2006 mortgage loan was refinanced the issuance of the 775 secured notes in april 2009 did not qualify for hedge accounting as the actual refinancing was not consistent with that anticipated as part of hedge accounting since it was determined in april 2009 that the hedged transaction did not and would not occur we discontinued hedge accounting and reclassified the entire loss 1329 million from aoci to earnings in the second quarter of 2009 for these specific interest rate swaps the refinancing of the 2004 mortgage loan in 2009 and the 2005 tower revenue notes in 2010 qualified as the respective hedged forecasted transaction 

currently we have elected to not early settle the forwardstarting interest rate swaps that hedged the refinancing of the 2006 mortgage loan and the 2005 tower revenue notes although they have been refinanced at a fixed rate during 2009 and early 2010 as a result these swaps are no longer economic hedges of our exposure to libor on anticipated refinancing of our existing debt and changes in the fair value of the swaps following the related refinancing are recorded in earnings until settlement these noneconomic hedges have a combined notional value of 35 billion inclusive of the 2005 tower revenue swaps dedesignated in january 2010 and the combined settlement value is a liability of approximately 3291 million as of january 31 2010 

the fair value of our interest rate swaps is determined using the income approach and is predominately based on observable interest rate yield curves and to a lesser extent the contract counterparty’s credit risk and our nonperformance risk the determination of the credit risk input is highly subjective and is primarily based on credit default swap spreads including indexes of comparable securities and management’s knowledge of current credit spreads in the debt market as of december 31 2009 a 50 basis point change in our credit spread would change the fair value of our interest rate swaps by less than one percent our credit valuation allowance at december 31 2009 decreased by 612 million or 82 to 138 million from the prior year primarily due to a decrease in the credit risk assumption related to ourselves as well as a 49 decrease in the cash settlement value 

as of december 31 2009 our outstanding forwardstarting interest rate swaps had a combined notional amount of 50 billion and totaled 3144 million on a settlement basis as of december 31 2009 we have recorded 1995 million net of tax in aoci related to interest rate swaps designated as hedges during 2009 we recorded 579 million net of tax in earnings related to interest rate swaps not designated as hedges and 25 million net of tax related to hedge ineffectiveness in january 2010 we refinanced the 2005 tower revenue notes and expect to reclassify an aggregate loss of 1553 million from aoci into earnings over a fiveyear period 

see also “item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk ” and notes 2 8 and 9 to our consolidated financial statements 

deferred income taxes we record deferred income tax assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet related to events that impact our financial statements and tax returns in different periods in order to compute these deferred tax balances we first analyze the differences between the book basis and tax basis of our assets and liabilities referred to as “temporary differences” these temporary differences are then multiplied by current tax rates to arrive at the balances for the deferred income tax assets and liabilities a valuation allowance is provided on deferred tax assets if it is determined that it is more likely than not that the asset will not be realized we recognize a tax position if it is more likely than not it will be sustained upon examination the tax position is measured at the largest amount that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 

the change in our net deferred income tax balances during a period generally results in a deferred income tax provision or benefit in our consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income loss if our expectations about the future tax consequences of past events should prove to be inaccurate the balances of our deferred income tax assets and liabilities could require significant adjustments in future periods such adjustments could cause a material effect on our results of operations for the period of the adjustment see note 10 to our consolidated financial statements 

  

before giving effect to any valuation allowances we are in an overall net deferred tax asset position that includes deferred tax assets of 751 million charged to aoci resulting from our interest rate swap liabilities we have recorded a valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets since it is more likely than not that the asset will not be realized the valuation allowance in effect limits our ability to recognize tax benefits in our results of operations in the future the amount if any of our valuation allowance is currently largely driven by our interest rate swap liability the fair value of which can vary based on movements in market interest rates 

impact of accounting standards issued but not yet adopted and those adopted in 2009 

in december 2007 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued guidance that established accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary these amendments to the accounting standards clarify that a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary is an ownership interest in the consolidated entity that should be reported as equity in the consolidated financial statements these amendments to the accounting standards require consolidated net income to be reported at amounts that include the amounts attributable to both the parent and the noncontrolling interest on january 1 2009 we adopted these amendments the adoption of these amendments did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements as a result of these amendments we have prospectively recorded the income or losses applicable to the noncontrolling interest of ccal even though the noncontrolling stockholders’ share of the cumulative losses exceeds their equity interests 

in december 2007 the fasb issued certain amendments that established principles and requirements for recognizing and measuring identifiable assets and goodwill acquired liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in an acquisition at their fair value as of the acquisition date these amendments will change the accounting treatment of certain items including that 1 acquisition and restructuring costs will be generally expensed as incurred 2 noncontrolling interests will be valued at fair value at the acquisition date 3 in certain circumstances acquired contingent liabilities will be recorded at fair value at the acquisition date and subsequently measured at either the higher of such amount or the amount determined under existing guidance for nonacquired contingencies and 4 changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances and income tax uncertainties after the acquisition date will affect provision for income taxes the provisions of the amended accounting guidance are applied prospectively to our business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after january 1 2009 these amendments may have a material impact on business combinations after adoption the impact from application of these amendments depends on the facts and circumstances of business combinations after adoption 

see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of recently issued accounting standards and the related impact on our consolidated financial statements 

nongaap financial measures 

our measurement of profit or loss currently used to evaluate the operating performance of our operating segments is earnings before interest taxes depreciation amortization and accretion as adjusted or adjusted ebitda our definition of adjusted ebitda is set forth in “item 7 mda—results of operations—comparison of operating segments ” our measure of adjusted ebitda may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies including companies in the tower sector and as used in the historical financial statements of global signal and is not a measure of performance calculated in accordance with gaap adjusted ebitda should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for operating income or loss net income or loss cash flows provided by used for operating investing and financing activities or other income statement or cash flow statement data prepared in accordance with gaap 

we believe adjusted ebitda is useful to an investor in evaluating our operating performance because 

 

  

  

   

  

 our management uses adjusted ebitda 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 there are material limitations to using a measure such as adjusted ebitda including the difficulty associated with comparing results among more than one company including our competitors and the inability to analyze certain significant items including depreciation and interest expense that directly affect our net income or loss management compensates for these limitations by considering the economic effect of the excluded expense items independently as well as in connection with their analysis of net income loss

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend our primary exposures to market risks are related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates which may adversely affect our results of operations and financial position we seek to manage exposure to changes in interest rates where economically prudent to do so by utilizing predominately fixed rate debt and interest rate swaps we do not currently hedge against foreign currency exchange risks 

interest rate risk 

our interest rate risk relates primarily to the impact of interest rate movements on the following inclusive of the refinancing of the 2005 tower revenue notes issued january 2010 and the repayment and purchases of debt in january 2010 

 

  

  

  

   

the discussion and tables presented below summarize our market risk exposure to interest rates including our use of interest rate swaps to manage and reduce this risk 

anticipated refinancing of existing debt 

during 2009 and january 2010 we issued 48 billion face value of debt and thereby extended the maturity of our debt portfolio by the end of 2011 we expect to refinance our 2006 tower revenue notes and we have entered into interest rate swaps to hedge the variability in cash flows from changes in libor on this anticipated refinancing we do not hedge our exposure to changes in credit spreads on this anticipated refinancing as the rates fixed by our interest rate swaps are exclusive of any credit spread our refinancings over the last year have increased our weightedaverage cost of debt as a result of the challenging credit markets our prospective debt financings may result in an increase in our weightedaverage cost of debt depending upon the state of the credit markets at the time of such financings 

see “item 7 mda—liquidity and capital resources—overview” for a discussion of the tower revenue notes anticipated repayment dates ranging from 2011 to 2020 and the associated increase in interest rate and principal amortization following the anticipated repayment date 

floating rate debt 

we manage our exposure to market interest rates on our existing debt by 1 controlling the mix of fixed and floating rate debt and 2 utilizing interest rate swaps to hedge variability in cash flows from changes in libor on our outstanding floating rate debt as of december 31 2009 we had 6321 million of floating rate debt of which 6000 million is effectively converted to a fixed rate through an interest rate swap until december 2011 as a result a hypothetical unfavorable fluctuation in market interest rates on our existing debt of two percentage points over a twelvemonth period would increase our interest expense by approximately 06 million 

interest rate swaps 

our interest rate swaps have an aggregate settlement value of 4117 million as of january 31 2010 and they are contractually due and payable between june 2010 and november 2011 these liability positions resulted from libor declining below the fixed rate of these interest rate swaps the stated rate of our future debt refinancing is exclusive of the impact of the interest rate swaps and reflects the benefit of the declines in libor from an economic perspective we have fixed our exposure to libor on the anticipated refinancing and the swap liabilities represent the opportunity cost of not benefiting from the declines in libor see the following table and in note 8 to our consolidated financial statements 

a hypothetical decrease of 100 basis points in the prevailing libor yield curve as of december 31 2009 would increase the liability for our swaps on a settlement value basis by nearly 270 million and a hypothetical increase in rates would reduce the liability by a similar amount we immediately mark to market in earnings interest rate swaps that are not designated as hedges as a result we estimate that the impact of the hypothetical unfavorable movement of 100 basis points would decrease earnings by approximately 205 million and an opposite hypothetical increase in libor would positively impact earnings by a similar amount inclusive of the impact of the swaps hedging the 2005 tower revenue notes that we dedesignated in january 2010 

as of february 2 2010 our interest rate swaps are with morgan stanley the royal bank of scotland plc and calyon who have credit ratings of “a2” or better from moody’s see note 8 to our consolidated financial statements and the tables below 

potential future borrowings of incremental debt 

we typically do not hedge our exposure to interest rates on potential future borrowings of incremental debt for a substantial period prior to issuance see “item 7 mda—liquidity and capital resources” regarding our shortterm liquidity strategy 

  

the following tables provide information about our market risk related to changes in interest rates the future principal payments weightedaverage interest rates and the interest rate swaps are presented as of december 31 2009 after giving effect to the refinancing of the 2005 tower revenue notes in january 2010 these debt maturities reflect contractual maturity dates exclusive of other longterm obligations that are de minimus and do not consider the impact of the principal payments that will commence following the anticipated repayment dates on the tower revenue notes see footnote b see notes 7 and 8 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our debt and interest rate swaps 

 

  

  

         

foreign currency risk 

the vast majority of our foreign currency risk is related to the australian dollar which is the functional currency of ccal ccal represented 5 of our consolidated revenues and 4 of our consolidated operating income for 2009 as of december 31 2009 the australian dollar exchange rate had strengthened compared to the us dollar by approximately 5 from the average rate for 2008 see “item 7 mda—results of operations—comparison of operating segments” 

foreign exchange markets have recently been volatile and we expect foreign exchange markets to continue to be volatile over the near term we believe the risk related to our financial instruments exclusive of intercompany financing deemed a longterm investment denominated in australian dollars is not significant to our financial condition a hypothetical increase or decrease of 25 in australian dollar exchange rate would increase or decrease the fair value of our financial instruments by approximately 5 million

 item 1 business 

overview 

we own operate and lease towers and other communication structures including certain rooftop installations collectively “towers” for wireless communications our core business is renting space on our towers via longterm contracts in various forms including license sublease and lease agreements generally our towers can accommodate multiple customers “colocation” for antennas and other equipment necessary for the transmission of wireless signals for mobile telephones and other devices revenues derived from this site rental business represented 92 of our 2008 consolidated revenues 

information concerning our tower portfolio as of december 31 2008 is as follows 

 

  

  

  

  

 our site rental revenues typically result from longterm contracts with 1 initial terms of five to fifteen years 2 multiple renewal periods at the option of the tenant of five to ten years each and 3 contractual escalators of the rental price as a result the vast majority of our site rental revenues is of a recurring nature and has been contracted for in a prior year we seek to increase our site rental revenues by adding more tenants on our towers which we expect to result in significant incremental cash flow due to our relatively fixed tower operating costs 

to a much lesser extent we also provide certain network services relating to our towers including antenna installations and subsequent augmentation network design and site selection site acquisition site development and other services 

  

index to financial statements strategy 

our strategy is to increase longterm stockholder value by translating anticipated future growth in our core site rental business into growth of our results of operations on a per share basis we believe our strategy is consistent with our mission to deliver the highest level of service to our customers at all times – striving to be their critical partner as we assist them in growing efficient ubiquitous wireless networks the key elements of our strategy are to 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 our longterm strategy is based on our belief that opportunities will be created by the expected continuation of growth in the wireless communications industry which depends on the demand for wireless telephony and data services by consumers thus far the wireless communications industry has not been impacted by the recent slowing economy to any significant degree the following is a discussion of certain growth trends in the wireless communications industry 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

index to financial statements   

 2008 highlights and recent developments 

see “item 7 mda” and our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of developments and activities occurring in 2008 and the beginning of 2009 including the issuance of our 9 senior notes in january 2009 and the challenging credit markets 

the company 

we operate our business primarily in the us including puerto rico and australia with nominal operations in canada and the united kingdom “uk” we conduct our operations principally through subsidiaries of crown castle operating company “ccoc” including 1 certain subsidiaries which operate our tower portfolios in the us puerto rico and canada collectively referred to as “ccusa” and 2 a 776 owned subsidiary that operates our australia tower portfolio referred to as “ccal” for more information about our operating segments as well as financial information about the geographic areas in which we operate see note 18 to our consolidated financial statements and “item 7 mda  ” 

ccusa 

overview the core business of ccusa is the renting of antenna space on our towers predominately to wireless carriers under longterm contracts supporting our competitive position in the site rental business we offer our tenants certain network services relating to our towers including antenna installations and other services at december 31 2008 ccusa owned leased or managed approximately 22500 towers although we own lease or manage approximately 200 towers located in puerto rico and canada that are included in ccusa our towers are predominately located in the us with concentrations in the 50 and 100 largest btas 

most of our ccusa towers were acquired through transactions consummated within the past nine years including through the transactions summarized below 

 

  

        

index to financial statements site rental ccusa rents space on its towers for antennas and other equipment and leases access to our distributed antenna systems for the transmission of a variety of wireless signals predominately related to wireless voice and data transmission 

we generally receive monthly rental payments from tenants payable under site leases over the last several years our new leases have generally had initial terms of seven to fifteen years with three or four optional renewal periods of five years each and provide for annual price increases based upon a consumer price index a fixed percentage or a combination thereof the lease agreements with our tenants relating to tower network acquisitions generally have an original term of ten years with multiple renewal options at the option of the tenant each typically ranging from five to ten years we have existing master lease agreements with most wireless carriers including sprint nextel att verizon wireless and tmobile which provide certain terms including economic terms that govern leases on our towers entered into by such parties during the term of their master lease agreements 

the average monthly rental payment of a new tenant added to a tower varies among the different regions in the us and the type of service being provided by the tenant with broadband tenants paying more than narrowband tenants such as paging primarily as a result of the physical size of the antenna installation we also routinely receive rental payment increases in connection with lease amendments which authorize carriers to add additional antennas or other equipment to towers on which they already have equipment pursuant to preexisting lease agreements 

the operating expenditures of our site rental business consist predominately of ground lease expense property taxes repairs and maintenance employee compensation and related benefit costs and utilities which tend to escalate at approximately the rate of inflation as a result of the relative fixed nature of these expenditures the colocation of additional tenants is achieved at a low incremental cost resulting in high incremental cash flows 

network services we also provide network services on a limited basis primarily relating to our towers for our tenants our service offerings consist of antenna installations and subsequent augmentation network design and site selection site acquisition site development and other services we have the capability and expertise to install with the assistance of our network of subcontractors equipment and antenna systems for our customers these activities are typically nonrecurring and highly competitive with a number of local competitors in most markets we typically bill for our antenna installation services on a fixed price basis network services revenues are received primarily from wireless communications companies or their agents 

customers in both the site rental and network services businesses we work with a number of customers we work extensively with large national wireless carriers such as sprint nextel att verizon wireless and tmobile approximately 48 of 2008 ccusa site rental revenues are with customers or their parent companies who are rated investment grade including att verizon wireless a joint venture of verizon communications and vodafone and tmobile a subsidiary of deutsche telecom in addition to the four largest customers our 2008 net revenues and new tenant additions were derived from second tier and emerging wireless customers such as those offering flat rate calling plans and wireless data technologies the following table summarizes the net revenues from our four largest customers expressed as a percentage of ccusa’s and our consolidated revenues for 2008 see “ item 1a risk factors ” 

 

  

 sales and marketing the ccusa sales organization markets our towers within the wireless communications industry with the objective of renting space on existing towers and on new towers prior to construction we seek to become the critical partner and preferred independent tower provider for our customers and increase customer satisfaction relative to our peers 

  

index to financial statements we use public and proprietary databases to develop targeted marketing programs focused on carrier network buildouts modifications site additions new tower builds distributed antenna systems and network services information about carriers’ existing location of antenna space leases marketing strategies capital spend plans deployment status and actual wireless carrier signal strength measurements taken in the field is analyzed to match specific towers in our portfolios with potential new site demand we have developed a patented webbased tool that stores key tower information above and beyond normal property management information including data on actual customer signal strength demographics site readiness and competitive structures in addition the webbased tool assists us in estimating potential demand for our towers with greater speed and accuracy through these and other tools we have developed we seek to have proactive discussions with our customers regarding their wireless infrastructure deployment plans and the timing and location of their demand for our towers 

a team of national account directors maintains our relationships with our largest customers these directors work to develop new tower leasing opportunities network services contracts and site management opportunities as well as to ensure that customers’ tower needs are efficiently translated into new leases on our towers sales personnel in our area offices develop and maintain local relationships with carriers that are expanding their networks entering new markets bringing new technologies to market or requiring maintenance or addon business in addition to our fulltime sales and marketing staff a number of senior managers and officers spend a significant portion of their time on sales and marketing activities and call on existing and prospective customers 

competition ccusa competes with 1 other independent tower owners which also provide site rental and network services 2 wireless carriers which build own and operate their own tower networks and lease space to other wireless communication companies and 3 owners of alternative facilities including rooftops broadcast towers distributed antenna systems utility poles and outdoor advertisers wireless carriers that own and operate their own tower networks generally are substantially larger and have greater financial resources than we have we believe that tower location and capacity deployment speed quality of service and price have been and will continue to be the most significant competitive factors affecting the leasing of a tower 

some of the larger independent tower companies with which ccusa competes in the us include american tower corporation sba communications corporation global tower partners and towerco significant additional site rental competition comes from the renting of rooftops utility structures and other alternative sites for antennas 

competitors in the network services business include site acquisition consultants zoning consultants real estate firms rightofway consulting firms construction companies tower owners and managers radio frequency engineering consultants telecommunications equipment vendors who can provide turnkey site development services through multiple subcontractors and our customers’ internal staffs we believe that carriers base their decisions on the outsourcing of network services on criteria such as a company’s experience track record local reputation price and time for completion of a project 

ccal 

our primary business in australia is the renting of antenna space on towers to our customers ccal is owned 776 by us and 224 by permanent nominees aust ltd acting on behalf of a group of professional and private investors led by todd capital limited ccal is the largest independent tower operator in australia as of december 31 2008 ccal had approximately 1600 towers with a strategic presence in each of australia’s major metropolitan areas including sydney melbourne brisbane adelaide and perth the vast majority of ccal’s towers were acquired from optus in 2000 and vodafone in 2001 ccal also provides a range of services including site maintenance and property management services for towers owned by third parties 

for 2008 ccal comprised 6 of our consolidated net revenues ccal’s principal customers are vodafone optus telstra and hutchison for 2008 these four carriers accounted for approximately 95 of ccal’s revenues with vodafone and optus accounting for 36 and 35 respectively in february 2009 vodafone and hutchison agreed to merge their australian operations in a joint venture named vha pty ltd we are evaluating the impact this joint venture may have on ccal however we currently do not believe it will have a material adverse impact 

  

index to financial statements in australia ccal competes with wireless carriers which own and operate their own tower networks service companies that provide site maintenance and property management services and other site owners such as broadcasters and building owners the two other significant tower owners in australia are broadcast australia an independent operator of broadcast towers and telstra a wireless carrier we believe that tower location capacity quality of service deployment speed and price within a geographic market are the most significant competitive factors affecting the leasing of a tower 

all four of the major carriers in australia have deployed extensive 3g networks which provide high bandwidth wireless services that are generally more robust and faster than typically experienced in the us in addition the wireless penetration rate in australia exceeds 100 eg number of devices exceeds population these 3g networks utilize a large number of our towers 

employees 

at february 17 2009 we employed approximately 1300 people worldwide we are not a party to any collective bargaining agreements we have not experienced any strikes or work stoppages and management believes that our employee relations are satisfactory 

regulatory matters 

to date we have not incurred any material fines or penalties or experienced any material adverse effects to our business as a result of any domestic or international regulations the summary below is based on regulations currently in effect and such regulations are subject to review and modification by the applicable governmental authority from time to time if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations we may be fined or even lose our rights to conduct some of our business 

united states 

federal regulations both the fcc and the federal aviation administration “faa” regulate towers used for wireless communications radio and television broadcasting such regulations control the siting lighting and marking of towers and may depending on the characteristics of particular towers require the registration of tower facilities with the fcc and the issuance of determinations confirming no hazard to air traffic wireless communications devices operating on towers are separately regulated and independently licensed based upon the particular frequency used in addition the fcc and the faa have developed standards to consider proposals for new or modified tower and antenna structures based upon the height and location including proximity to airports proposals to construct or to modify existing tower and antenna structures above certain heights are reviewed by the faa to ensure the structure will not present a hazard to aviation which determination may be conditioned upon compliance with lighting and marking requirements the fcc requires its licensees to operate communications devices only on towers that comply with faa rules and are registered with the fcc if required by its regulations where tower lighting is required by faa regulation tower owners bear the responsibility of notifying the faa of any tower lighting outage and ensuring the timely restoration of such outages failure to comply with the applicable requirements may lead to civil penalties 

local regulations the us telecommunications act of 1996 amended the communications act of 1934 to preserve state and local zoning authorities’ jurisdiction over the siting of communications towers the law however limits local zoning authority by prohibiting actions by local authorities that discriminate between different service providers of wireless services or ban altogether the provision of wireless services additionally the law prohibits state and local restrictions based on the environmental effects of radio frequency emissions to the extent the facilities comply with fcc regulations 

local regulations include city and other local ordinances including subdivision and zoning ordinances approvals for construction modification and removal of towers and restrictive covenants imposed by community developers these regulations vary greatly but typically require us to obtain approval from local officials prior to tower construction local zoning authorities may render decisions that prevent the construction or modification of towers or place conditions on such construction or modifications that are responsive to community residents’ concerns regarding the height visibility and other characteristics of the towers decisions of local zoning authorities may also adversely affect the timing and cost of tower construction and modification 

  

index to financial statements other regulations we hold through certain of our subsidiaries certain licenses for radio transmission facilities granted by the fcc including licenses for common carrier microwave service commercial and private mobile radio service specialized mobile radio and paging service which are subject to additional regulation by the fcc our fcc license relating to our 16701675 mhz us nationwide spectrum license “spectrum” contains certain conditions related to the services that may be provided thereunder the technical equipment used in connection therewith and the circumstances under which it may be renewed we are required to obtain the fcc’s approval prior to assigning or transferring control of our fcc licenses 

australia 

federal regulations carrier licenses and nominated carrier declarations issued under the australian telecommunications act 1997 authorize the use of network units for the supply of telecommunications services to the public the definition of “network units” includes line links and base stations used for wireless telephony services but does not include tower infrastructure accordingly ccal as a tower owner and operator does not require a carrier license under the australian telecommunications act 1997 similarly because ccal does not own any transmitters or spectrum it does not currently require any apparatus or spectrum licenses issued under the australian radiocommunications act 1992 

carriers have a statutory obligation to provide other carriers with access to towers and if there is a dispute including a pricing dispute the matter may be referred to the australian competition and consumer commission for resolution as a noncarrier ccal is not subject to this regime and our customers negotiate site access on a commercial basis 

while the australian telecommunications act 1997 grants certain exemptions from planning laws for the installation of “low impact facilities” newly constructed towers are expressly excluded from the definition of “low impact facilities” accordingly in connection with the construction of towers ccal is subject to state and local planning laws which vary on a site by site basis structural enhancements may be undertaken on behalf of a carrier without state and local planning approval under the general “maintenance power” under the australian telecommunications act 1997 although these enhancements may be subject to state and local planning laws if ccal is unable to obtain carrier cooperation to use that legislative power for a limited number of towers ccal is also required to install aircraft warning lighting in compliance with federal aviation regulations in australia a carrier may arguably be able to utilize the “maintenance power” under the australian telecommunications act 1997 to remain as a tenant on a tower after the expiration of a site license or sublease however ccal’s customer access agreements generally limit the ability of customers to do this and even if a carrier did utilize this power the carrier would be required to pay for ccal’s financial loss which would roughly equal the site rental revenues that would have otherwise been payable 

local regulations in australia there are various local state and territory laws and regulations which relate to among other things town planning and zoning restrictions standards and approvals for the design construction or alteration of a structure or facility and environmental regulations as in the us these laws vary greatly but typically require tower owners to obtain approval from governmental bodies prior to tower construction and to comply with environmental laws on an ongoing basis 

environmental matters 

to date we have not incurred any material fines or penalties or experienced any material adverse effects to our business as a result of any domestic or international environmental regulations or matters see “item 1a risk factors” 

the construction of new towers in the us may be subject to environmental review under the national environmental policy act of 1969 as amended “nepa” which requires federal agencies to evaluate the environmental impact of major federal actions the fcc has promulgated regulations implementing nepa which require applicants to investigate the potential environmental impact of the proposed tower construction should the proposed tower construction present a significant environmental impact the fcc must prepare an environmental impact statement subject to public comment if a proposed tower may have a significant impact on the environment the fcc’s approval of the construction could be significantly delayed 

our operations are subject to federal state and local laws and regulations relating to the management use storage disposal emission and remediation of and exposure to hazardous and nonhazardous substances materials and wastes as an owner lessee or operator of real property we are subject to certain environmental laws that 

  

index to financial statements impose strict jointandseveral liability for the cleanup of onsite or offsite contamination relating to existing or historical operations and we could also be subject to personal injury or property damage claims relating to such contamination we are potentially subject to environmental and cleanup liabilities in the us including puerto rico and australia 

as licensees and tower owners we are also subject to regulations and guidelines that impose a variety of operational requirements relating to radio frequency emissions as employers we are subject to osha and similar occupational health and safety legislation in australia and similar guidelines regarding employee protection from radio frequency exposure the potential connection between radio frequency emissions and certain negative health effects including some forms of cancer has been the subject of substantial study by the scientific community in recent years 

we have compliance programs and monitoring projects to help assure that we are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws nevertheless there can be no assurance that the costs of compliance with existing or future environmental laws will not have a material adverse effect on us

 item 1a risk factor s tableend you should carefully consider all of the risks described below as well as the other information contained in this document when evaluating your investment in our securities 

we have a substantial amount of indebtedness the majority if not all of which we anticipate refinancing or repaying within the next three years in the event we do not repay or refinance such indebtedness we could face substantial liquidity issues and might be required to issue equity securities or securities convertible into equity securities or sell some of our assets to meet our debt payment obligations 

we have a substantial amount of indebtedness approximately 68 billion as of february 17 2009 and we anticipate refinancing the majority if not all of this indebtedness and our preferred stock within the next three years if our tower revenue notes which were issued by our us tower subsidiaries that comprised substantially all of our tower business prior to the global signal merger and had an aggregate outstanding principal amount of 345 billion as of december 31 2008 are not repaid in full by their anticipated repayment dates five years from their original issuances in 2005 and 2006 then the interest rates on those notes will increase substantially by the greater of 1 an additional 5 per annum over their current rates or 2 the amount if any by which the sum of the following exceeds the note rate for a class of tower revenue notes the yield to maturity on the applicable anticipated repayment date of the united states treasury security having a term closest to 10 years plus 5 plus the postanticipated repayment date spread for such class of tower revenue notes and monthly amortization payments will commence if this occurs then substantially all of the cash flows of those tower subsidiaries must be applied to repay principal of the tower revenue notes as of february 17 2009 our mortgage loans which were issued by the global signal tower subsidiaries prior to the global signal merger in the aggregate principal amounts of 2465 million and 146 billion have contractual maturities in december 2009 and february 2011 respectively if we fail to repay or refinance such mortgage loans when due it would constitute an event of default under such mortgage loans as well as some of our other indebtedness we are also required to redeem all outstanding shares of our 625 convertible preferred stock in august 2012 for approximately 3230 million including accrued but unpaid dividends there can be no assurances we will be able to effect these anticipated refinancings on commercially reasonable terms or terms including with respect to interest rates as favorable as our current debt and preferred stock or at all 

in early 2007 a crisis began in the subprime mortgage sector as a result of rising delinquencies and credit quality deterioration and the conditions in the general credit markets have continued to deteriorate with widening credit spreads and a lack of liquidity including certain debt markets being unavailable in addition to a lack of liquidity in the general credit markets the current credit crisis has resulted in a widening of credit spreads in the marketplace in general and for us specifically this crisis together with the global economic recession have adversely impacted our access to capital and there can be no assurances that the global economic recession or the liquidity crisis will not worsen or negatively impact the availability and cost of debt financing including with respect to any refinancings of the obligations described above 

if we are unable to refinance or renegotiate our debt we cannot guarantee that we will be able to generate enough cash flows from operations or that we will be able to obtain enough capital to service our debt pay our obligations under our convertible preferred stock or fund our planned capital expenditures in such an event we 

  

index to financial statements could face substantial liquidity issues and might be required to issue equity securities or securities convertible into equity securities or sell some of our assets to meet our debt payment obligations failure to refinance indebtedness when required could result in a default under such indebtedness assuming we meet certain financial ratios we have the ability under our debt instruments to incur additional indebtedness and any additional indebtedness we incur could exacerbate the risks described above see the risk factor below concerning our obligations relating to our interest rate swaps 

our substantial level of indebtedness could adversely affect our ability to react to changes in our business and the terms of our debt instruments limit our ability to take a number of actions that our management might otherwise believe to be in our best interests in addition if we fail to comply with our covenants our debt could be accelerated 

as a result of our need to repay and refinance debt in the current difficult credit markets demands on our cash resources are higher than they otherwise would be which could negatively impact our business results of operations and financial condition 

as a result of our substantial indebtedness 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 currently we have debt instruments in place that limit in certain circumstances our ability to incur indebtedness pay dividends create liens sell assets and engage in certain mergers and acquisitions our subsidiaries under their debt instruments are also required to maintain specific financial ratios our ability to comply with the financial ratio covenants under these instruments and to satisfy our debt obligations will depend on our future operating performance if we fail to comply with the debt restrictions we will be in default under those instruments which in some cases would cause the maturity of substantially all of our longterm indebtedness to be accelerated if our subsidiaries that issued the tower revenue notes and mortgage loans were to default on the debt the trustee could seek to foreclose upon or otherwise convert the ownership of the securitized towers in which case we could lose the towers and the revenues associated with the towers 

ccic and ccoc are holding companies and conduct all of their operations through their subsidiaries accordingly ccic’s and ccoc’s source of cash to pay interest and principal on their outstanding indebtedness and preferred stock is distributions relating to their ownership interests in their subsidiaries from the net earnings and cash flow generated by such subsidiaries or from proceeds of debt or equity offerings earnings and cash flow generated by their subsidiaries are first applied by such subsidiaries in conducting their operations including the service of their respective debt obligations after which any excess cash flow generally may be paid to a holding company however their subsidiaries are legally distinct from the holding companies and unless they guarantee such debt have no obligation to pay amounts due on their debt or to make funds available to us for such payment 

our interest rate swaps are currently in a substantial liability position and will need to be cash settled within the next three years which could adversely affect our financial condition 

we have used interest rate swaps to hedge our interest rate risk related to variability in libor which could adversely affect our financial condition as a result of our interest rate swaps we would not benefit from the recent declines in libor if the declines remain when we will need to cash settle these obligations generally on the anticipated issuance date of the forecasted transaction as of february 17 2009 our outstanding forwardstarting interest rate swaps had a combined notional amount of 53 billion and the liability on a settlement basis totaled 

  

index to financial statements 5031 million on a settlement basis in addition as of february 17 2009 we have two interest rate swaps with a combined notional amount of 6250 million that will be settled in 2009 and would currently result in total payments by us of 174 million see “item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” for the cash obligations by year of maturity based on current interest rates and the yield curve in effect as of december 31 2008 required to settle the forwardstarting interest rate swaps 

our business depends on the demand for wireless communications and towers and we may be adversely affected by any slowdown in such demand 

demand for our towers depends on the demand for antenna space from our customers which in turn depends on the demand for wireless telephony and data services by their customers the willingness of our customers to utilize our infrastructure or renew existing leases on our towers is affected by numerous factors including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 a slowdown in demand for wireless communications or our towers may negatively impact our revenues or otherwise have a material adverse effect on us 

a substantial portion of our revenues is derived from a small number of customers and the loss consolidation or financial instability of or network sharing among any of our limited number of customers may materially decrease revenues 

for 2008 approximately 72 of our consolidated revenues was derived from sprint nextel att verizon wireless and tmobile which represented 23 19 18 and 12 respectively of our consolidated net revenues the loss of any one of our large customers as a result of bankruptcy insolvency consolidation merger with other customers of ours or otherwise may materially decrease our revenues and have other adverse effects on our business we cannot guarantee that the leases including management agreements with our major wireless carriers will not be terminated or that these carriers will renew such agreements see also “ item 1 business—the company ” 

consolidation among our customers may result in duplicate or overlapping parts of networks which may result in a reduction of sites and have a negative effect on revenues and cash flows 

consolidation among our customers will likely result in duplicate or overlapping parts of networks which may result in a reduction of cell sites and impact revenues from our towers in addition consolidation may result in a reduction in such customers’ future capital expenditures in the aggregate because their expansion plans may be similar in the last several years certain of our larger carrier customers have merged including cingular wireless now known as att with att wireless in october 2004 and sprint with nextel in august 2005 any industry consolidation could decrease the demand for our towers which in turn may result in a reduction in our revenues and cash flows 

sales or issuances of a substantial number of shares of our common stock may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

future sales or issuances of a substantial number of shares of common stock or other equity related securities may adversely affect the market price of our common stock as of february 17 2009 we had 2887 million shares 

  

index to financial statements of common stock outstanding in addition we reserved 1 156 million shares of common stock for future issuance under our various stock compensation plans and 2 86 million shares of common stock for the conversion of our outstanding convertible preferred stock if conditions in the credit markets do not improve we may face liquidity issues and might be required to issue equity securities or securities convertible into equity securities which may cause the price of our common stock to decline significantly 

in addition a small number of stockholders own a significant percentage of our outstanding common stock if any one of these stockholders or any group of our stockholders sells a large quantity of shares of our common stock or the public market perceives that existing stockholders might sell a large quantity of shares of our common stock the market price of our common stock may significantly decline 

a wireless communications industry slowdown may materially and adversely affect our business including reducing demand for our towers and network services and the business of our customers 

in past years the wireless communications industry has periodically experienced significant general slowdowns which negatively affected the factors described in these risk factors influencing demand for tower space and network services similar slowdowns in the future may reduce consumer demand for wireless services or negatively impact the debt and equity markets thereby causing carriers to delay or abandon implementation of new systems and technologies the global economic recession is predicted by many to continue and perhaps worsen during 2009 there can be no assurances that such a difficult economic environment will not adversely impact the wireless communications industry which may materially and adversely affect our business including by reducing demand for our towers and network services a wireless communications industry slowdown may result in the writeoff of some or all of our goodwill and our inability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards 

as a result of competition in our industry including from some competitors with significantly more resources or less debt than we have we may find it more difficult to achieve favorable rental rates on our towers 

we face competition for site rental customers from various sources including 

 

  

  

  

 wireless carriers that own and operate their own tower portfolios are generally substantially larger and have greater financial resources than we have competition for tenants on towers may adversely affect rental rates and revenues 

new technologies may significantly reduce demand for our towers and negatively impact our revenues 

improvements in the efficiency of wireless networks could reduce the demand for our towers for example signal combining technologies that permit one antenna to service multiple frequencies and thereby multiple customers may reduce the need for our towers in addition other technologies such as wireless mesh networks voiceoverwifi femtocells satellite transmission systems such as low earth orbiting and distributed antenna systems may in the future serve as substitutes for or alternatives to leasing that might otherwise be anticipated or expected on our towers had such technologies not existed any significant reduction in tower leasing demand resulting from the previously mentioned technologies or other technologies may negatively impact our revenues or otherwise have a material adverse effect on us 

new wireless technologies may not deploy or be adopted by customers as rapidly or in the manner projected 

there can be no assurances that 3g 4g wireless data services such as email internet and mobile video or other new wireless technologies will be introduced or deployed as rapidly or in the manner projected by the wireless or broadcast industries in addition demand and customer adoption rates for such new technologies may be lower or slower than anticipated for numerous reasons as a result growth opportunities and demand for our towers as a result of such technologies may not be realized at the times or to the extent anticipated 

  

index to financial statements if we fail to retain rights to the land under our towers our business may be adversely affected 

our real property interests relating to the land on which our towers reside consist primarily of leasehold and subleasehold interests fee interests easements licenses and rightsofway a loss of these interests may interfere with our ability to conduct our business and generate revenues for various reasons we may not always have the ability to access analyze and verify all information regarding titles and other issues prior to completing an acquisition of towers further we may not be able to renew ground leases on commercially viable terms our ability to retain rights to the land on which our towers reside depends on our ability to renegotiate and extend the terms of the ground leases subleases and licenses relating to the land on which our towers reside or purchase the land on which such towers reside approximately 11 of our towers are on land where our property interests in such land have a final expiration date of less than ten years our inability to retain rights to the land on which our towers reside may have a material adverse effect on us 

if we are unable to raise capital in the future when needed we may not be able to fund future growth opportunities 

we may need additional sources of debt or equity capital in the future to fund growth opportunities including other alternatives to funding discretionary capital expenditures given the global economic recession and current capital constraints additional financing may be unavailable may be prohibitively expensive or may be restricted by the terms of our outstanding indebtedness additional sales of equity securities would dilute our existing stockholders if we are unable to raise capital when our needs arise we may not be able to fund future growth opportunities 

our lease relating to our spectrum has certain risk factors different from our core tower business including that the spectrum lease may not be renewed or continued that the option to acquire the spectrum license may not be exercised and that the spectrum may not be deployed which may result in the revenues derived from the spectrum being less than those that may otherwise have been anticipated 

we entered into a lease as lessor relating to the spectrum rights we acquired in 2003 pursuant to an fcc license our spectrum lease has an initial term for a 13 million annual lease fee beginning july 23 2007 until october 1 2013 upon the expiration of the initial term of the lease the lessee will have the right to acquire the spectrum for 130 million with a consumer price index adjustment from july 2007 or to renew the lease for a period of up to ten years on the same terms subject to the annual lease fee increasing to 143 million the lessee’s right to renew the lease or acquire the spectrum following the initial term is subject to fcc license renewal and approval which may not be obtained in the event that the lessee defaults on the spectrum lease that the option to acquire the spectrum license or renew the spectrum lease is not exercised or that the spectrum is not deployed the revenues derived from the spectrum may be substantially less than anticipated 

if we fail to comply with laws or regulations which regulate our business and which may change at any time we may be fined or even lose our right to conduct some of our business 

a variety of federal state local and foreign laws and regulations apply to our business failure to comply with applicable requirements may lead to civil penalties or require us to assume indemnification obligations or breach contractual provisions we cannot guarantee that existing or future laws or regulations including state and local tax laws will not adversely affect our business increase delays or result in additional costs these factors may have a material adverse effect on us 

our network services business has historically experienced significant volatility in demand which reduces the predictability of our results 

the operating results of our network services business for any particular period may vary significantly and should not necessarily be considered indicative of longerterm results for this activity in the foreseeable future network services revenues may decline as a percentage of our total revenues due to our focus on our core rental business increased competition or other factors the global economic recession is predicted by many to continue and perhaps worsen during 2009 there can be no assurances that such a difficult economic environment will not adversely impact our network services business 

  

index to financial statements if radio frequency emissions from wireless handsets or equipment on our towers are demonstrated to cause negative health effects potential future claims could adversely affect our operations costs and revenues 

the potential connection between radio frequency emissions and certain negative health effects including some forms of cancer has been the subject of substantial study by the scientific community in recent years we cannot guarantee that claims relating to radio frequency emissions will not arise in the future or that the results of such studies will not be adverse to us 

public perception of possible health risks associated with cellular and other wireless communications may slow or diminish the growth of wireless companies which may in turn slow or diminish our growth in particular negative public perception of and regulations regarding these perceived health risks may slow or diminish the market acceptance of wireless communications services if a connection between radio emissions and possible negative health effects were established our operations costs and revenues may be materially and adversely affected we currently do not maintain any significant insurance with respect to these matters 

certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation bylaws and operative agreements and domestic and international competition laws may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us or for us to acquire control of a third party even if such a change in control would be beneficial to our stockholders 

we have a number of antitakeover devices in place that will hinder takeover attempts and may reduce the market value of our common stock our antitakeover provisions include 

 

  

  

 our bylaws permit special meetings of the stockholders to be called only upon the request of our chief executive officer or a majority of the board of directors and deny stockholders the ability to call such meetings such provisions as well as the provisions of section 203 of the delaware general corporation law may impede a merger consolidation takeover or other business combination or discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us 

in addition domestic and international competition laws may prevent or discourage us from acquiring towers or tower networks in certain geographical areas or impede a merger consolidation takeover or other business combination or discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us 

we are exposed to counterparty risk through our interest rate swaps and a counterparty default could adversely affect our financial condition 

as a consequence of the global financial crisis the credit worthiness of certain of our contracted counterparties particularly financial institutions has deteriorated and therefore we are exposed to an increased risk that one or more of the counterparties to our hedging transactions could default on their obligations to us which could adversely affect our financial condition for example a subsidiary of lehman brothers holding inc “lehman brothers” that is the counterparty for two of our interest rate swaps filed for bankruptcy in october 2008 these two interest rate swaps had a combined notional value of 475 million and represented a liability to us of approximately 463 million as of december 31 2008 our arrangements with lehman brothers are subject to the resolution of lehman’s bankruptcy proceedings and may result in an assignment of our arrangement by lehman to a third party while we have certain rights to object to an assignment the outcome of such proceedings is uncertain we also have interest rate swaps with other financial institutions including morgan stanley and the royal bank of scotland plc to the extent the financial crisis and libor increases cause our credit exposure to contracted counterparties to become an asset such increased exposure could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

  

index to financial statements we may be adversely effected by exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates relating to our operations in australia 

our australian operations expose us to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates for 2008 approximately 6 of our consolidated net revenues were denominated in australian dollars we have not historically engaged in significant hedging activities relating to our australian operations and we may suffer future losses as a result of changes in currency exchange rates

towers are vertical metal structures generally ranging in height from 50 to 1500 feet in addition wireless communications equipment may also be placed on building rooftops towers are generally located on tracts of land of up to ten acres these tracts of land support the towers equipment shelters and where applicable guy wires to stabilize the structure 

we are and expect to continue to endeavor to renegotiate and extend the terms of ground leases and in some cases are acquiring the land on which such towers reside to further our control of the property interests in the land on which our towers are located for a tabular presentation of the remaining terms to final expiration of the ground leases subleases or licenses for the land which we do not own and on which our towers are located as of december 31 2008 see “ item 7 mda—liquidity and capital resources—contractual cash obligations” 

as of december 31 2008 we owned in fee or had perpetual or longterm easements in the land on which approximately 23 of our towers reside up from 20 as of december 31 2007 and we leased subleased or licensed the land on which approximately 74 of our towers reside in addition as of december 31 2008 approximately 3 of our towers were owned by third parties where we had the right to market space on the tower or where we had sublease arrangements with the tower owner our ground leases subleases and licenses generally have five or ten year initial terms at ccusa and ten to 15 year initial terms at ccal and frequently contain one or more renewal options 

  

index to financial statements our tower revenue notes issued in 2005 and 2006 are effectively secured by approximately 6800 of our towers and the cash flows from those towers governing documents relating to another approximately 4900 towers prevent liens from being granted on those towers without approval of a subsidiary of verizon however distributions paid from the entities that own those towers will also service the tower revenue notes in addition approximately 9000 of our towers and the cash flows derived from these towers are effectively pledged as security for our mortgage loans see note 6 to our consolidated financial statements 

substantially all of our ccusa towers can accommodate another tenant either as currently constructed or with appropriate modifications to the tower additionally if so inclined as a result of customer demand we could generally also tear down an existing tower and reconstruct another tower in its place with additional capacity subject to certain restrictions as of december 31 2008 the weightedaverage number of tenants per tower is approximately 27 on our ccusa towers a summary of the number of existing tenants per ccusa tower as of december 31 2008 is as follows

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend general overview 

overview 

we own operate and lease over 24000 towers for wireless communications including the towers acquired in the global signal merger see “ item 7 mda—general overview—acquisition of global signal ” revenues generated from our core site rental business represented 92 of our 2008 consolidated revenues ccusa our largest operating segment accounted for 94 of our 2008 site rental revenues of which 74 were derived from the four largest wireless carriers in the us the vast majority of our site rental revenues is of a recurring nature and has been contracted for in a prior year see “ item 1 business ” 

the following are certain highlights of our business fundamentals as further discussed in this form 10k including in “item 1 business” and this mda  

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 our longterm strategy is to increase stockholder value by translating anticipated future growth in our core site rental business into growth in our results of operations on a per share basis the key elements of our strategy are see “item 1 business” for further discussion 

 

  

 our longterm strategy is based on our belief that opportunities will be created by the expected continued growth in the wireless communications industry which depends predominately on the demand for wireless telephony and data services by consumers as a result of such expected growth in the wireless communications industry we believe that the demand for our towers will continue and result in organic growth of our revenues due to the colocation of additional tenants on our existing towers we expect that new tenant additions or modifications of existing installations collectively referred to as “tenant additions” on our towers should result in significant incremental cash flow due to the relatively fixed costs to operate a tower which tend to increase at approximately the rate of inflation certain of the growth trends in the wireless communications industry are discussed in “item 1 business—strategy” 

the following is a discussion of certain recent events which may impact our business and our strategy or the wireless communications industry 

 

  

   

index to financial statements we expect this spectrum auction fcc advanced wireless services auction no 66 and future spectrum auctions should enable next generation networks 

 

  

  

  

  

 acquisition of global signal 

on january 12 2007 we completed the global signal merger in a stock and cash transaction valued at approximately 40 billion exclusive of debt of approximately 18 billion that remained outstanding as obligations after the global signal merger we funded the global signal merger with approximately 981 million shares of common stock and 550 million of cash obtained primarily from the issuance of tower revenue notes in 2006 we entered into the global signal merger primarily because of anticipated growth opportunities in the global signal tower portfolio including through leveraging our management team and customer service across an enhanced national footprint we believe such opportunities for growth will be driven by the previously mentioned growth trends in the wireless communications industry 

the global signal merger significantly increased our tower portfolio by 10749 towers and significantly impacted the comparability of our results of operations and changes in financial condition to prior years the integration of global signal’s operations and tower portfolio was completed in the first quarter of 2008 see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of the global signal merger including 1 the allocation of the purchase price and 2 our unaudited pro forma consolidated results of operations for 2007 as if the global signal merger were completed as of the beginning of 2007 see also notes 3 4 6 8 and 19 to our consolidated financial statements 

results of operations 

the following discussion of our results of operations should be read in conjunction with “item 1 business” “item 7 mda—liquidity and capital resources” and our consolidated financial statements the following discussion of our results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the us which require us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts see “item 7 mda—accounting and reporting matters—critical accounting policies and estimates” and note 1 to our consolidated financial statements 

  

index to financial statements the net addition of towers affects the yeartoyear comparability of our operating results due to the fact that our operating results only include these towers from the date of their addition or until their date of disposition a large majority of the increase between 2006 and 2007 in our site rental revenues site rental costs of operations general and administrative expenses integration costs depreciation amortization and accretion and income tax benefit is attributable to the global signal merger see “item 7 mda—general overview—acquisition of global signal” in addition to the towers acquired in the global signal merger we built or acquired 487 188 and 336 towers in 2006 2007 and 2008 respectively 

comparison of consolidated results 

the following is a comparison of our 2006 2007 and 2008 consolidated results of operations 

 

  

    

index to financial statements 2007 and 2008 our consolidated results of operations for 2007 and 2008 respectively predominately consist of our ccusa segment which accounted for 1 94 and 94 of consolidated net revenues 2 94 and 94 of consolidated gross margins and 3 96 and 79 of consolidated net loss our operating segment results for 2007 and 2008 including ccusa are discussed below see “item 7 mda—results of operations—comparison of operating segments ” 

net revenues for 2008 increased by 1410 million or 10 from 2007 of which site rental revenues represented 82 of the overall increase this increase in site rental revenues was primarily driven by tenant additions across our entire tower portfolio tenant additions were influenced by the previously mentioned growth trends in the wireless communications industry 

site rental gross margins site rental revenues less site rental costs of operations for 2008 increased by 1033 million or 12 from 2007 the increase in the site rental gross margins was predominately driven by the previously mentioned increase in site rental revenues we expect that future increases in site rental revenues resulting from tenant additions on our towers will have a high incremental margin percentage of revenue growth converted to gross margin given the relatively fixed nature of the costs to operate our towers 

net loss for 2008 was 489 million and included 1 a noncash impairment charge of 559 million related to our investment in fibertower 2 losses on the change in fair value of certain interest rate swaps of 379 million and 3 tax benefits of 749 million resulting from the completion of an irs examination net loss for 2007 was 2228 million inclusive of 1 a noncash impairment charge of 756 million related to our investment in fibertower 2 the asset writedown and restructuring charges related to modeo totaling 607 million and 3 integration costs related to the global signal merger of 254 million the improvement in net loss was predominately due to the incremental gross margin in our site rental business of 1033 million and the impact of the previously mentioned charges and benefits 

2006 and 2007 our consolidated results of operations for 2006 and 2007 respectively consist predominately of our ccusa segment which accounted for 1 92 and 94 of consolidated net revenues 2 92 and 94 of consolidated gross margins and 3 88 and 96 of consolidated net loss our operating segment results for 2006 and 2007 including ccusa are discussed below see “item 7 mda—results of operations—comparison of operating segments ” 

net revenues for 2007 increased by 5973 million or 76 from 2006 of which site rental revenues represented 99 of the overall increase this increase in site rental revenues was driven by 1 the towers acquired in connection with the global signal merger and to a lesser extent 2 tenant additions on our preglobal signal merger towers occurring during or after 2006 and 3 the 474 towers acquired from mountain union tenant additions were influenced by the previously mentioned growth trends in the wireless communications industry 

site rental gross margins site rental revenues less site rental costs of operations for 2007 increased by 3589 million or 74 from 2006 the increase in the site rental gross margins was predominately driven by the previously mentioned increase in site rental revenues we expect that future increases in site rental revenues resulting from tenant additions on our towers will have a high incremental margin percentage of revenue growth converted to gross margin given the relatively fixed nature of the costs to operate our towers 

in addition the global signal merger resulted in 1 an increase in general and administrative expenses in nominal dollars but a decrease in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues as a result of synergies from operating a larger tower portfolio 2 the vast majority of the increase in depreciation amortization and accretion expense 3 the integration costs for 2007 4 additional interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs relating to the 18 billion of mortgage loans and 5 our recording of income tax benefits resulting from the deferred tax liability recorded in purchase accounting that resulted in a change from a net deferred tax asset position to a net deferred tax liability position 

our net loss for 2007 increased by 1809 million from 2006 predominately due to 1 the net impact of the previously mentioned global signal merger 2 a noncash impairment charge of 756 million relating to our investment in fibertower and 3 asset writedown charges 576 million and restructuring charges 31 million related to modeo totaling 607 million offset by 4 growth in our site rental business on preglobal signal merger towers 

  

index to financial statements comparison of operating segments 

our reportable operating segments for 2008 are 1 ccusa primarily consisting of our us including puerto rico tower operations and 2 ccal our australian tower operations our financial results are reported to management and the board of directors in this manner 

see note 18 to our consolidated financial statements for segment results and a reconciliation of net income loss to adjusted ebitda defined below 

our measurement of profit or loss currently used to evaluate our operating performance and operating segments is earnings before interest taxes depreciation amortization and accretion as adjusted “adjusted ebitda” our measure of adjusted ebitda may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies including companies in the tower sector and is not a measure of performance calculated in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” 

we define adjusted ebitda as net income loss plus restructuring charges credits asset writedown charges integration costs depreciation amortization and accretion interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs losses on purchases and redemptions of debt net gain loss on interest rate swaps impairment of availableforsale securities interest and other income expense benefit provision for income taxes minority interests cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle income loss from discontinued operations and stockbased compensation expense see note 12 to our consolidated financial statements the calculation of adjusted ebitda for our operating segments is set forth in note 18 to our consolidated financial statements adjusted ebitda is not intended as an alternative measure of operating results or cash flows from operations as determined in accordance with gaap and adjusted ebitda may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies adjusted ebitda is discussed further under “ item 7 mda — accounting and reporting matters—nongaap financial measures ” 

ccusa—2007 and 2008 net revenues for 2008 increased by 1334 million or 10 from 2007 this increase in net revenues resulted from an increase in site rental revenues of 1097 million or 9 for the same periods this increase in site rental revenues was driven primarily by 82 million from new tenant additions across our entire portfolio inclusive of the impact of straightline accounting for certain lease escalators in addition to new tenant additions our site rental revenues are influenced by various factors in no particular order including 1 escalations net of the impact of straight line accounting 2 impact of straight line accounting from renewal of customer leases 3 new towers acquired or constructed 4 a full year of revenues from our spectrum lease and 5 cancelation of customer leases see mda—accounting and reporting matters—critical accounting policies and estimates” for a further discussion of our revenue recognition policies tenant additions were influenced by the previously mentioned growth in the wireless communications industry we continue to derive a large portion of our site rental revenues and new tenant additions from the four largest carriers in the us in addition to the four largest carriers our 2008 net revenues and new tenant additions were also derived from second tier and emerging wireless customers such as those offering flat rate calling plans and wireless data technologies 

network services and other revenues for 2008 increased by 237 million or 26 from 2007 the increase in network services and other revenues was as a result of performing services on a larger portfolio of towers due to the global signal merger global signal did not operate a network services business so the network services and other revenues performed on the global signal towers increased during 2007 and 2008 as we began marketing services for those towers the network services business is typically nonrecurring and the volume of activity can vary significantly from period to period in relation to tenant additions on our towers 

site rental gross margins for 2008 increased by 983 million or 12 from 2007 the increase in the site rental gross margins was related to the previously mentioned 9 increase in site rental revenues primarily driven by tenant additions site rental gross margins as a percentage of site rental revenues for 2008 increased by two percentage points from 2007 to 67 primarily as a result of the high incremental margins associated with tenant additions given the relatively fixed costs to operate a tower the 983 million incremental margin represents 90 of the related increase in site rental revenues 

general and administrative expenses for 2008 increased by 73 million or 6 from 2007 but decreased to 9 of total net revenues from 10 of total net revenues general and administrative expenses are inclusive of stockbased compensation charges as discussed further in note 12 to our consolidated financial statements the increase in 

  

index to financial statements general and administrative expenses was primarily due to the increase in stockbased compensation typically our general and administrative expenses do not significantly increase as a result of the colocation of additional tenants on our towers as indicated by the decrease in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues from 2007 to 2008 

adjusted ebitda for 2008 increased by 1029 million or 14 from 2007 adjusted ebitda was positively impacted by the growth in our site rental business including the high incremental margin on the tenant additions 

integration costs for 2008 were 25 million compared to 254 million in 2007 the decrease resulted from the completion of the integration of the global signal tower portfolio during the first quarter of 2008 see “item 7 mda—general overview—acquisition of global signal ” and notes 2 and 19 to our consolidated financial statements 

depreciation amortization and accretion for 2008 decreased by 136 million or 3 from 2007 the decrease resulted from towers acquired from global signal with short useful lives as defined by gaap that were fully depreciated at december 31 2007 our tower assets are recorded at cost estimated replacement cost for those acquired and are depreciated using a useful life that is defined as the period equal to the shorter of 20 years or the term of the underlying ground lease including renewal options see “item 7 mda—accounting and reporting matters—critical accounting policies and estimates” 

interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs for 2008 increased by 43 million or 1 from 2007 we made no material changes in our indebtedness during 2007 and 2008 other than the mortgage loans 18 billion that remained outstanding as obligations after the global signal merger on january 11 2007 and the issuance of term loans 6500 million in january and march 2007 our weightedaverage interest rate for 2008 was relatively consistent with 2007 as a result of virtually all of our debt having fixed rate coupons see “item 7 mda—liquidity and capital resources—overview ” 

in 2007 and 2008 we recorded noncash impairment charges of 756 million and 559 million respectively related to declines in the fair value of our investment in fibertower that was deemed otherthantemporary any potential future writedowns are limited to the carrying value of our investment of 42 million as of december 31 2008 see note 5 to our consolidated financial statements 

benefit provision for income taxes for 2008 was a benefit of 1066 million compared to 953 million for 2007 the tax benefits for 2008 include tax benefits of 749 million resulting from the completion of the irs examination of our us federal tax return for 2004 the effective tax rate for 2008 differs from the federal statutory rate due predominately to income tax benefits resulting from the completion of the irs examination and a full valuation allowance on our unrealized capital losses from our investment in fibertower see note 8 to our consolidated financial statements 

net loss for 2008 was 384 million inclusive of 1 noncash impairment charges of 559 million related to our investment in fibertower 2 losses on the change in fair value of certain interest rate swaps of 379 million and 3 tax benefits of 749 million resulting from the completion of an irs examination net loss for 2007 was 2149 million inclusive of 1 a noncash impairment charge of 756 million related to our investment in fibertower 2 the asset writedown and restructuring charges related to modeo totaling 607 million and 3 integration costs related to the global signal merger of 254 million the improvement in net loss was predominately due to the incremental gross margin in our site rental business of 983 million and the impact of the previously mentioned charges and benefits 

ccal—2007 and 2008  the increases and decreases between 2007 and 2008 are inclusive of exchange rate fluctuations the average exchange rate of australian dollars to us dollars for 2008 was approximately 085 an increase of 2 from approximately 084 for the same period in the prior year see “ item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk ” 

total net revenues for 2008 increased by 76 million or 9 from 2007 the increase in total net revenues was influenced by various factors including tenant additions on our towers and towers acquired after the third quarter of 2007 network services and other revenues and tenant additions were influenced by the continued development of several 3g networks in australia see “item 1 business—the company—ccal” 

  

index to financial statements adjusted ebitda for 2008 increased by 56 million or 14 from 2007 adjusted ebitda was positively impacted by the same factors that drove the increase in site rental revenues more specifically site rental gross margins increased by 50 million or 10 for 2008 from 497 million the 50 million incremental margin represents 78 of the related increase in site rental revenues 

net income loss for 2008 was a loss of 105 million an increase of 26 million from 2007 the increase in net loss was primarily driven by a 89 million increase in interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs resulting predominately from an intercompany borrowing between segments partially offset by the growth in the site rental business the proceeds of the intercompany borrowing were primarily utilized to fund the capital return in may 2007 in order to increase the leverage of the ccal business 

ccusa—2006 and 2007 net revenues for 2007 increased by 5763 million or 79 from 2006 this increase in net revenues resulted from an increase in site rental revenues of 5709 million or 89 for the same period this increase in site rental revenues was driven by 1 the towers acquired in connection with the global signal merger and to a lesser extent 2 new tenant additions and 3 the 474 towers acquired from mountain union tenant additions were influenced by the previously mentioned growth in the wireless communications industry although we continue to derive a large portion of our site rental revenues from the four largest carriers in the us we have experienced an increase in tenant additions during 2007 from emerging wireless carriers and second tier carriers such as those offering wireless data technologies and flat rate calling plans 

network services and other revenues for 2007 increased by 54 million or 6 from 2006 the increase in network services and other revenues was as a result of performing services on a larger portfolio of towers due to the global signal merger global signal did not operate a network services business so the network services and other revenues performed on the global signal towers increased during each quarter of 2007 as we began marketing services for those towers exclusive of network services and other revenues derived from the global signal towers network services and other revenues declined modestly from 2006 to 2007 the network services business is typically nonrecurring and the volume of activity can vary significantly from period to period in relation to tenant additions on our towers 

site rental gross margins for 2007 increased by 3456 million or 77 from 2006 the increase in the site rental gross margins was related to the previously mentioned 89 increase in site rental revenues primarily driven by the towers acquired in connection with the global signal merger and to a lesser extent from tenant additions site rental gross margins as a percentage of site rental revenues for 2007 decreased by 42 percentage points from 2006 to 65 primarily as a result of the less mature global signal towers that have lower revenues per tower and higher ground rent expense as a percentage of revenues than our preglobal signal merger towers we believe the global signal towers have significant additional revenue and margin growth opportunities provided by potential future tenant additions on those towers 

general and administrative expenses for 2007 increased by 338 million from 2006 but decreased to 10 of total net revenues from 13 of total net revenues general and administrative expenses are inclusive of stockbased compensation charges as discussed further below the increase in general and administrative expenses in nominal dollars was primarily related to headcount additions and related employee costs as a result of the global signal merger partially offset by cost reductions from the termination of the modeo employees see notes 17 and 19 to our consolidated financial statements the decrease in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues was driven by synergies from operating a larger tower portfolio as a result of the global signal merger 

adjusted ebitda for 2007 increased by 3195 million or 80 from 2006 adjusted ebitda was positively impacted by the same factors that drove the increase of 89 in our site rental revenues including the towers acquired in connection with the global signal merger and tenant additions 

we recognized stockbased compensation expense from continuing operations of 149 million and 235 million respectively for 2006 and 2007 the primary reason for fluctuations in the stockbased compensation expense during 2006 to 2007 is 1 accelerated vesting of awards granted in 2004 and 2005 and 2 our grants in 2006 and 2007 during 2005 restricted stock granted during 2004 and 2005 accelerated vested based on the market performance of our common stock this accelerated vesting resulted in the recognition of 152 million of expense in 2005 that was originally to be recognized over the original vesting period through 2009 and 2010 in addition during 2006 and 2007 we granted 12 million and 14 million shares respectively of restricted stock with grant date weightedaverage requisite service periods of 25 and 21 years respectively see note 12 to our consolidated financial statements 

  

index to financial statements in july 2007 we entered into a lease of our spectrum the spectrum is leased to a venture formed by harbinger capital partners master fund i ltd harbinger capital partners special situations fund lp telcom ventures llc and columbia capital llc “hhtc” for a 13 million annual lease fee with an initial term from july 23 2007 until october 1 2013 as a result we eliminated substantially all of the future modeo operating and administrative expenses which for 2007 were 40 million in addition for 2007 we recorded 1 site revenues of 57 million from the spectrum lease 2 asset writedown charges of 576 million as a result of the writeoff of substantially all of our modeo assets other than the spectrum and 3 restructuring charges of 31 million related to the termination of the modeo employees see notes 17and 19 to our consolidated financial statements 

integration costs for 2007 were 254 million and related to the global signal merger these integration costs included among other things expenses for retention bonus obligations with employees of the former global signal costs for contracted employees directly related to the integration and stockbased compensation charges with respect to restricted stock awards assumed in the global signal merger see “item 7 mda—general overview—acquisition of global signal ” and notes 2 and 19 to our consolidated financial statements 

depreciation amortization and accretion for 2007 increased by 2543 million or 99 from 2006 the vast majority of this increase was related to the depreciation and amortization attributable to property and equipment and intangible assets recorded in connection with the purchase price allocation for the global signal merger our tower assets are recorded at cost estimated replacement cost for those acquired and are depreciated using a useful life that is defined as the period equal to the shorter of 20 years or the term of the underlying ground lease including renewal options see “item 7 mda—accounting and reporting matters—critical accounting policies and estimates” 

interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs for 2007 increased by 1880 million or 118 from 2006 the increase was primarily attributable to additional indebtedness the components of the increase in indebtedness primarily include 1 the issuance of the tower revenue notes 155 billion in november 2006 2 the mortgage loans 18 billion that remained outstanding as obligations after the global signal merger and 3 the issuance of term loans 6500 million during the first half of 2007 this additional indebtedness was offset by our repayment of 10 billion of borrowings under a credit facility using proceeds of the 155 billion tower revenue notes exclusive of the mortgage loans our net increase in debt during 2007 primarily related to 1 funding 550 million for the global signal merger and 2 purchases of our common stock in 2007 see “item 7 mda—liquidity and capital resources—overview ” 

in 2007 we recorded a noncash impairment charge of 756 million related to a decline in the value of our investment in fibertower that was deemed otherthantemporary 

benefit provision for income taxes for 2007 was a benefit of 953 million compared to a provision of 05 million for 2006 we recorded a deferred tax liability of 5566 million as part of the allocation of the purchase price of the global signal merger which was offset in part by the reversal of our federal valuation allowance of 2597 million as a result we 1 are no longer in a net deferred tax asset position 2 are generally no longer recording a valuation allowance on net deferred tax assets because of our historical net operating losses and 3 can generally record the benefit of tax impacts of our results in the statement of operations and comprehensive income loss 

income from discontinued operations of 57 million for 2006 relates primarily to the reversal of liabilities previously established in conjunction with the sale of our former ccuk operations as a result of the termination of related contingencies during 2006 

net income loss for 2007 was a loss of 2149 million compared to a loss of 370 million for 2006 the increased loss was primarily due to 1 the increases in depreciation amortization and accretion and interest expense all of which were predominately related to the global signal merger 2 a noncash impairment charge of 756 million related to our investment in fibertower and 3 asset writedown charges 576 million and restructuring charges 31 million related to modeo totaling 607 million partially offset by 1 the increase in adjusted ebitda as a result of the towers acquired in the global signal merger and growth in our site rental business and 2 our benefit for income taxes 

  

index to financial statements ccal—2006 and 2007 the increases and decreases between 2006 and 2007 are inclusive of exchange rate fluctuations the average exchange rate of australian dollars to us dollars for 2007 was approximately 084 an increase of 11 from approximately 075 for the same period in the prior year see “item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” 

total net revenues for 2007 increased by 210 million or 35 from 2006 the increase in total net revenues was due to growth in site rental revenues primarily related to 1 tenant additions on our towers 2 exchange rate fluctuations 3 contractual escalations on existing leases with variable escalations and 4 new towers acquired after the third quarter of 2006 see “item 1 business—the company—ccal” 

adjusted ebitda for 2007 increased by 117 million or 40 from 2006 adjusted ebitda was positively impacted by the same factors that drove the increase in site rental revenues more specifically site rental gross margins increased by 133 million or 37 to 70 of site rental revenues for 2007 from 364 million or 69 of site rental revenues for 2006 the 133 million incremental margin represents 71 of the related increase in site rental revenues 

in may 2007 ccal our 776 majorityowned subsidiary issued a capital return of approximately 1660 million including 372 million to the minority shareholders of ccal the capital return was funded by ccoc through an intercompany borrowing by ccal upon issuance of the capital return we recorded a reduction in additional paidin capital of 89 million as a result of the capital return to the ccal minority shareholders exceeding the carrying value of the minority interests in ccal the intercompany borrowing and related capital return was issued to increase the leverage of the ccal business 

net income loss for 2007 was a loss of 79 million an increase in the loss of 30 million from 2006 the increased net loss was primarily driven by a 91 million increase in interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs predominately as a result of an intercompany borrowing between segments and the increase in stockbased compensation charges of 29 million partially offset by the same factors that drove the improvement in adjusted ebitda see note 12 to our consolidated financial statements 

impact of inflation other than the towers acquired from global signal the majority of our towers were acquired between 1999 and 2001 tower assets and related depreciation expense do not reflect the impact of inflation occurring subsequent to the acquisition of these towers the impact of inflation on our results of operations for the 2006 2007 and 2008 was not significant 

liquidity and capital resources 

overview 

general our site rental business is generally characterized by a stable cash flow stream generated by revenues under longterm contracts that should be recurring for the foreseeable future over the last five years our cash from operations have exceeded our cash interest payments and sustaining capital expenditures and provided us with cash available for discretionary investments we seek to allocate the cash produced by our operations in a manner that will enhance per share operating results given the current conditions in the credit markets we currently expect to limit our discretionary investments and use the majority of our cash to purchase or repay our debt historically we invested our available cash in discretionary investments such as those discussed in “ item 1 business—strategy ” which we expect to resume in the future depending upon the credit environment and availability of liquidity in the capital markets 

  

index to financial statements liquidity position the following is a summary of our capitalization and liquidity position see “item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” and notes 6 and 7 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our debt 

 

  

   debt maturities and recent events our debt and preferred stock maturities as of february 17 2009 are summarized as follows 

 

  

  

  

  

 in light of the global economic recession and the current challenging credit markets we have taken the following actions to manage our debt maturities and build liquidity with cash flows from operations 

 

  

  

   

index to financial statements these efforts to increase liquidity and purchase our debt are being undertaken to prudently manage our liquidity as a result of the global economic recession and the current credit environment however we plan on endeavoring to refinance the tower revenue notes and mortgage loans with new debt on or before their repayment dates our ability to obtain borrowings that are securitized by tower cash flows and are at commercially reasonable terms will depend on various factors such as our ability to generate cash flows on our existing towers and the state of the capital markets if we are unable to refinance our debt with similar instruments we may explore other forms of financing which may include other forms of debt or issuances of equity or equity related securities see “item 7 mda—liquidity and capital resources—factors affecting sources of liquidity ” 

longterm strategy our longterm strategy contemplates funding our discretionary investments primarily with operating cash flows and in certain instances potential future debt financings and issuances of equity or equity related securities over the longterm we may continue to increase our debt if we realize anticipated future growth in our operating cash flows in order to maintain debt leverage that we believe is appropriate to drive longterm stockholder value the amount of future debt financings is influenced by such factors as 1 the availability of financing at attractive rates particularly in light of the current economic and credit environment 2 our belief in the potential longterm return of our previously mentioned discretionary investments 3 selfimposed limits such as our targeted leverage ratio of generally five to seven times adjusted ebitda and interest coverage ratio of adjusted ebitda to interest expense of at least two times and 4 our restrictive debt covenants discussed further below 

summary cash flows information 

 

 operating activities 

the increase in net cash provided by operating activities for 2008 of 1626 million from 2007 was due primarily to the growth in our core site rental business net cash provided by operating activities is inclusive of prepayments for longterm easements and ground leases for land under our towers these prepayments are part of our efforts to renegotiate and extend the terms of our interests in the land under our towers we expect net cash provided by operating activities for 2009 will be less than 2008 primarily as a result of higher interest costs resulting from the 9 senior notes issued in 2009 offset by anticipated growth in our core site rental business changes in working capital and particularly changes in deferred rental revenues prepaid ground leases and accrued interest can have a dramatic impact on our net cash from operating activities for interim periods largely due to the timing of payments and receipts 

investing activities 

capital expenditures our capital expenditures can be generally categorized as sustaining or discretionary sustaining capital expenditures include capitalized costs related to 1 maintenance activities on our towers 2 vehicles 3 information technology equipment and 4 office equipment discretionary capital expenditures which we commonly also refer to as “revenuegenerating capital expenditures” include 1 purchases of land under towers 2 tower improvements in order to support additional site rentals 3 the construction or purchase of towers and 4 the construction of distributed antenna systems 

  

index to financial statements a summary of our capital expenditures for 2007 and 2008 is as follows 

 

 as previously mentioned we expect to reduce our capital expenditures from recent levels in order to increase liquidity available for debt service we expect these reductions to include our purchases of land construction and purchase of towers and the construction of distributed antenna systems we expect to continue to extend the terms of ground leases which requires substantially less liquidity than purchases of land given current capital constraints we may seek alternative arrangements with third parties in order to continue discretionary investments including capital expenditures other than sustaining capital expenditures which we expect to be approximately 25 million to 30 million for full year 2009 our capital expenditures are discretionary and are made with respect to activities we believe exhibit sufficient potential to improve our longterm results of operations on a per share basis such decisions are influenced by the availability and cost of capital and expected returns on alternative investments 

acquisition of global signal see “item 7 mda—general overview—acquisition of global signal” 

financing activities 

in light of the current challenges in the credit markets and consistent with our previously mentioned strategy to prudently manage liquidity our financing activities for 2008 included purchases of common stock and additional borrowings at reduced levels from our past practices however we are still committed to our longterm strategy to allocate our capital to drive longterm stockholder value which may include making discretionary investments such as purchases of our debt and common stock the following is a summary of the significant financing transactions completed in 2008 and the beginning of 2009 

9 senior notes on january 27 2009 ccic issued 900 million principal amount of 9 senior notes due 2015 in a public offering these 9 senior notes are general obligations of ccic which rank equally with all existing and future senior debt of ccic the 9 senior notes are effectively subordinated to all liabilities including trade payables of each subsidiary of ours these 9 senior notes bear interest at a rate of 90 per annum payable semiannually on january 15 and july 15 of each year beginning on july 15 2009 

the net proceeds from these 9 senior notes were 7957 million inclusive of 863 million original issue discount and 180 million of fees the effective yield of these 9 senior notes is approximately 113 inclusive of the discount we may use these net proceeds for general corporate purposes including our anticipated purchases or repayments of our existing debt 

at our option we may redeem these 9 senior notes in whole or in part prior to january 15 2013 by paying 100 of the principal amount together with accrued and unpaid interest if any plus a “make whole” premium we may also redeem some or all of these 9 senior notes on or after january 15 2013 at the redemption prices set forth in the indenture plus accrued and unpaid interest if any in addition until january 15 2012 and subject to certain conditions we may at our option redeem up to 35 of these 9 senior notes at the redemption price set forth in the indenture with the proceeds of certain equity offerings 

the 9 senior notes contain restrictive covenants that are discussed in “item 7 mda—liquidity and capital resources—factors affecting sources of liquidity” 

  

index to financial statements debt purchases the following is a summary of our purchases of debt during january and february 2009 these debt purchases were made by ccic because of restrictions upon the subsidiaries issuing the debt as a result the debt remains outstanding at our subsidiaries we expect to continue to purchase or redeem our debt in the future 

 

  

 credit agreement in january 2007 ccoc entered into a credit agreement that provided a 2500 million senior secured revolving credit facility in january 2009 we amended the revolving credit facility to extend the maturity until january 2010 and reduce the total revolving commitment to 188 million we paid an extension fee of 94 million but our credit spreads were not impacted by this amendment as of december 31 2008 we had 1694 million outstanding under the revolving credit facility availability of the revolving credit facility at any time is determined by certain financial ratios we may use the availability under the revolving credit facility for general corporate purposes which may include financing of capital expenditures acquisitions and purchases of our common or preferred stock the revolving credit facility bears interest at prime rate or libor plus a credit spread based on our consolidated leverage ratio as of december 31 2008 the weightedaverage interest rate of the revolving credit facility was 25 including the credit spread 

for a further discussion of the revolving credit facility and the term loans see note 6 to our consolidated financial statements and “item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” 

common stock activity a summary of common stock activity in 2007 and 2008 is as follows 

 

 during 2007 and 2008 we purchased 210 million and 12 million shares of our common stock respectively we utilized 7298 million and 447 million in cash respectively to affect these purchases and paid an average price per share of 3486 and 3690 respectively see note 11 to our consolidated financial statements see “item 7 mda—general overview—acquisition of global signal” for a discussion of common stock issued in the global signal merger 

during 2008 the holders converted 638 million of the 4 convertible senior notes into 59 million shares of our common stock as of december 31 2008 there are no 4 convertible senior notes outstanding 

  

index to financial statements preferred stock dividends we have the option to pay dividends on our 625 convertible preferred stock in cash or shares of common stock valued at 95 of the current market value of the common stock as defined see “item 5 market for registrant’s common equity related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities”  since 2005 we have elected to pay the dividends in cash and expect to continue to do so for the foreseeable future we are required to redeem all outstanding shares of our 625 convertible preferred stock on august 15 2012 at a price equal to the liquidation preference plus accumulated and unpaid dividends the shares of 625 convertible preferred stock are convertible at the option of the holder in whole or in part at any time into shares of common stock at a conversion price of 36875 per share of common stock under certain circumstances we generally have the right to convert the 625 convertible preferred stock in whole or in part into 86 million shares of common stock if the price per share of our common stock equals or exceeds 120 of the conversion price or 4425 for at least 20 trading days in any consecutive 30day trading period 

interest rate swaps we have used and may continue to use when we deem prudent interest rate swaps to manage and reduce our interest rate risk including the use of interest rate swaps to hedge the variability in cash flows from changes in libor on anticipated refinancing and outstanding variable rate debt see “item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” and note 6 to our consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of our use of interest rate swaps 

restricted cash  pursuant to the indenture governing the tower revenue notes and the loan agreements governing the mortgage loans all rental cash receipts of the issuers of these debt instruments and their subsidiaries are restricted and held by an indenture trustee the restricted cash in excess of required reserve balances is subsequently released to us in accordance with the terms of the indentures see also notes 1 and 6 to our consolidated financial statements 

contractual cash obligations 

the following table summarizes our contractual cash obligations which relate primarily to our outstanding borrowings and ground lease obligations as of december 31 2008 after giving effect to 1 the extension of the revolving credit facility maturity to january 2010 from january 2009 2 the purchases of debt in january and february 2009 and 3 the issuance of the 9 senior notes exclusive of the impact of using the proceeds to make future purchases or repayments of debt the debt maturities reflect contractual maturity dates and do not consider the impact of the principal payments that will commence following the anticipated repayment dates on the tower revenue notes see footnote a

 the following table summarizes as of december 31 2008 the remaining terms to expiration including renewal terms at our option of 1 the ground leases subleases or licenses for the land on which approximately 17900 of our towers reside and 2 agreements to manage approximately 700 towers owned by third parties where we had sublease agreements with the tower owner in addition we own in fee or have perpetual or longterm easements in the land on which approximately 5500 of our towers reside 23 of total towers see “ item 1a risk factors ” 

 

 factors affecting sources of liquidity 

holding companies as holding companies ccic and ccoc will require distributions or dividends from their subsidiaries or will be forced to use their remaining cash balances to fund their debt the terms of the current indebtedness of their subsidiaries allow them to distribute cash to their holding companies unless they experience a deterioration of financial performance 

compliance with debt covenants  our debt obligations contain certain financial covenants with which ccic or our subsidiaries must maintain compliance in order to avoid the imposition of certain restrictions various of our debt obligations also place other restrictions on ccic or our subsidiaries including the ability to incur debt and liens purchase our securities make capital expenditures dispose of assets undertake transactions with affiliates make other investments and pay dividends see note 6 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our debt covenants 

the financial maintenance covenants under our credit agreement are as follows 

 

  

   the 9 senior notes contain restrictive covenants with which we and our restricted subsidiaries must comply subject to a number of exceptions and qualifications including restrictions on our ability to incur incremental debt issue preferred stock guarantee debt pay dividends repurchase our capital stock use assets as security in 

  

index to financial statements other transactions sell assets or merge with or into other companies and make certain investments certain of these covenants are not applicable if there is no event of default and if the ratio of the company’s consolidated debt as defined in the senior notes indenture and to its adjusted consolidated cash flows as defined in the senior notes indenture is less than 70 to 1 our consolidated debt to adjusted consolidated cash flow is 76 times as of december 31 2008 pro forma for 1 the 9 senior notes exclusive of the impact of using the proceeds to make future purchases or repayments of debt and 2 our debt purchases in january and february 2009 the 9 senior notes contain the previously mentioned restrictive covenants but do not contain any financial maintenance covenant that could result in default 

factors that are likely to determine our subsidiaries’ ability to comply with their current and future debt covenants include their 1 financial performance 2 levels of indebtedness and 3 debt service requirements given the current level of indebtedness of our subsidiaries the primary risk of a debt covenant violation would be from a deterioration of a subsidiary’s financial performance should a covenant violation occur in the future as a result of a shortfall in financial performance or for any other reason we might be required to make principal payments earlier than currently scheduled and may not have access to additional borrowings under these facilities as long as the covenant violation continues any such early principal payments would have to be made from our existing cash balances or cash from operations if our subsidiaries that issued the tower revenue notes and mortgage loans were to default on the debt the trustee could seek to foreclose upon or otherwise convert the ownership of the securitized towers in which case we could lose the towers and the revenues associated with the towers we currently have no financial covenant violations and based upon our current expectations we believe our operating results will be sufficient to comply with our debt covenants see “ item 1a risk factors ” 

financial performance of our subsidiaries a factor affecting our continued generation of cash flows from operating activities is our ability to maintain our existing recurring site rental revenues and to convert those revenues into operating cash flows by efficiently managing our operating costs our ability to service pay principal and cash interest or refinance our current debt obligations and obtain additional debt will depend on our future financial performance which to a certain extent is subject to various factors that are beyond our control as discussed further herein and in “item 1a risk factors” 

levels of indebtedness and debt service requirements  our ability to obtain cash financing in the form of debt instruments preferred stock or common stock in the capital markets depends on among other things general economic conditions conditions of the wireless industry wireless carrier consolidation or network sharing new technologies our financial performance and the state of the capital markets we anticipate refinancing the majority if not all of our debt and redeemable preferred stock within the next six years there can be no assurances we will be able to effect this anticipated financing on commercially reasonable terms or on terms including with respect to interest rates as favorable as our current debt and preferred stock assuming we meet certain financial ratios we have the ability under our debt instruments to incur additional indebtedness and any additional indebtedness we incur could exacerbate our liquidity risks 

if we are unable to refinance or renegotiate our debt we cannot guarantee that we will be able to generate enough cash flows from operations or that we will be able to obtain enough capital to service our debt pay our obligations under our convertible preferred stock or fund our planned capital expenditures in such an event we could face substantial liquidity issues and might be required to issue equity securities or securities convertible into equity securities or sell some of our assets to meet our debt payment obligations failure to refinance indebtedness when required could result in a default under such indebtedness if our tower revenue notes are not repaid in full by their anticipated repayment dates june 2010 or november 2011 then the interest rates increase by approximately 5 per annum and excess cash flow as defined in the indenture of the issuers of the tower revenue notes will be used to repay principal resulting in a reduction in cash available for discretionary investments in particular ccic and ccoc are holding companies with no operations of their own and as such will require distributions or dividends from their subsidiaries to fund their debt see “item 1a risk factors” 

the current credit environment has resulted in a substantial widening of credit spreads in the market since the issuance of a majority of our existing debt as we refinance our existing debt or borrow additional debt changes in our credit spreads may impact our interest expense and interest coverage ratios 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we have no offbalance sheet arrangements as defined in item 303a4ii of regulation sk

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the following is a discussion of the accounting policies and estimates that we believe 1 are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and 2 require our most difficult subjective or complex judgments often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain the critical accounting policies and estimates for 2008 are not intended to be a comprehensive list of our accounting policies and estimates see note 1 to our consolidated financial statements for a summary of our significant accounting policies in many cases the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by gaap with no need for management’s judgment in their application in other cases management is required to exercise judgment in the application of accounting principles with respect to particular transactions 

revenue recognition site rental revenues are recognized on a monthly basis over the fixed noncancelable term of the relevant lease or agreement with terms generally ranging from five to fifteen years in accordance with applicable accounting standards these revenues are recognized on a monthly basis regardless of whether the payments from the customer are received in equal monthly amounts if the payment terms call for fixed escalations as in fixed dollar or fixed percentage increases or rent free periods the effect is recognized on a straightline basis over the fixed noncancelable term of the agreement when calculating our straightline rental revenues we consider all fixed elements of tenant leases escalation provisions even if such escalation provisions also include a variable element as a result of recognizing revenue on a straightline basis a portion of the revenue in a given period represents cash collected in other periods for 2006 2007 and 2008 the noncash portion of our site rental revenues related to recognizing revenue on a straightline basis amounted to approximately 205 million 429 million and 403 million respectively see note 1 to our consolidated financial statements 

we provide network services such as antenna installations and subsequent augmentation network design and site selection site acquisition services site development and other services on a limited basis network services revenues are generally recognized under a method which approximates the completed contract method under the completed contract method revenues and costs for a particular project are recognized in total at the completion date when using the completed contract method of accounting for network services revenues we must accurately determine the completion date for the project in order to record the revenues and costs in the proper period for antenna installations we consider the project complete when the customer can begin transmitting its signal through the antenna we must also be able to estimate losses on uncompleted contracts as such losses must be recognized as soon as they are known the completed contract method is used for projects that require relatively short periods of time to complete generally less than one year such as our network services agreements and contracts we do not believe that our use of the completed contract method for network services projects produces financial position and operating results that differ substantially from the percentageofcompletion method 

some of our arrangements with our customers call for the performance of multiple revenuegenerating activities generally these arrangements include both site rental and network services in such cases we determine whether the multiple deliverables are to be accounted for separately or on a combined basis in order to be accounted for separately the undelivered items must 1 have standalone value to the customer 2 have reliably determinable fair value on a separate basis and 3 have delivery which is probable and under our control in addition the delivered item must have standalone value to the customer allocation of recognized revenue in such arrangements is based on the relative fair value of the separately delivered items we have generally determined that it is appropriate to account for antenna installation activities separately from the customer’s subsequent site rentals 

accounting for longlived assets we allocate the purchase price of acquisitions to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair value at the date of acquisition any purchase price in excess of the net fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is allocated to goodwill the fair value of certain of our assets and liabilities is determined by 1 using estimates of replacement costs for tangible fixed assets such as towers and 2 using discounted cash flow valuation methods for estimating identifiable intangibles such as site rental contracts and abovemarket and belowmarket leases the purchase price allocation requires subjective estimates that if incorrectly estimated could be material to our consolidated financial statements including the amount of depreciation amortization and accretion expense the determination of the final purchase price 

  

index to financial statements allocation could extend over several quarters resulting in the use of preliminary estimates that are subject to adjustment until finalized during 2007 we completed the purchase price allocation for the global signal merger and had no significant acquisitions in 2008 

we are required to make subjective assessments as to the useful lives of our tangible and intangible assets for purposes of determining depreciation amortization and accretion expense that if incorrectly estimated could be material to our consolidated financial statements depreciation expense for our property and equipment is computed using the straightline method over the estimated useful lives of our various classes of tangible assets the substantial portion of our property and equipment represents the cost of our towers which is depreciated with an estimated useful life equal to the shorter of 20 years or the term of the lease including optional renewals for the land under the tower the useful life of our intangible assets are estimated based on the period for which the intangible asset will benefit us our intangible assets predominately consist of site rental contracts that generally are amortized over a 20 year useful life 

we record the fair value of obligations to perform certain asset retirement activities including requirements pursuant to our ground leases to remove towers or remediate the land upon which our towers reside in determining the fair value of these asset retirement obligations we must make several subjective and highly judgmental estimates such as those related to 1 timing of cash flows 2 future costs and 3 discount rates see notes 1 and 15 to our consolidated financial statements 

we review the carrying values of property and equipment intangible assets and other longlived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable if the sum of the estimated future cash flows undiscounted from the asset is less than its carrying amount an impairment loss is recognized measurement of an impairment loss is based on the fair value of the asset our determination that an adverse event or change in circumstance has occurred will generally involve 1 a deterioration in an asset’s financial performance compared to historical results 2 a shortfall in an asset’s financial performance compared to forecasted results or 3 a change in strategy affecting the utility of the asset our measurement of the fair value of an impaired asset will generally be based on an estimate of discounted future cash flows 

we test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis regardless of whether adverse events or changes in circumstances have occurred the annual test begins with goodwill and all intangible assets being allocated to applicable reporting units goodwill is then tested using a twostep process that begins with an estimation of fair value of the reporting unit using an income approach which looks to the present value of expected future cash flows the first step is a screen for potential impairment while the second step measures the amount of impairment if there is an indication from the first step that one exists our reporting units are the operating segments since segment management operates their respective tower portfolios as a single network our measurement of the fair value for goodwill is based on an estimate of discounted future cash flows of the reporting unit the most important estimates for such calculations are the expected additions of new tenants on our towers the terminal multiple for our projected cash flows our weightedaverage cost of capital and control premium 

on october 1 2008 we performed our annual goodwill impairment test the results of this test indicated that goodwill was not impaired at any of our reporting units despite the decline in our common stock price during the fourth quarter our market capitalization was in excess of 80 above the aggregate carrying amount of the reporting units as of december 31 2008 future declines in our site rental business could result in an impairment of goodwill property and equipment and intangible assets in the future if impairment were to occur in the future the calculations to measure the impairment could result in the writeoff of some portion to substantially all of our goodwill property and equipment and intangible assets 

interest rate swaps we enter into interest rate swaps to manage and reduce our interest rate risk the designation of our interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges requires judgment including with respect to the required assessment of the effectiveness of hedging relationships both at inception and on an ongoing basis we have designated certain of our interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges the effective portion of changes in fair value of interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income “aoci” and is recognized in earnings when the hedged item affects earnings in contrast the change in fair value of interest rate swaps related to hedge ineffectiveness and for those not designated as cash flow hedges is immediately marked to market in earnings 

  

index to financial statements our interest rate swaps are predominately forwardstarting in assessing effectiveness of our forward starting swaps both at inception and on an ongoing basis we must make several highly subjective and judgmental estimates such as 1 those related to the timing amount nature and probability of these future expected refinancings and 2 assessing whether it is probable that the counterparties to our swaps will not default the state of the current credit markets makes these estimates regarding future refinancings especially difficult as of december 31 2008 we have estimated that it is probable the expected refinancings will occur changes in our assessment of hedge effectiveness including as result of changes in estimates regarding these future refinancings may result in prospectively discontinuing hedge accounting or the immediate reclassification of the current unrealized loss from aoci to earnings 

the fair value of our interest rate swaps is determined using the income approach and is predominately based on observable interest rate yield curves and to a lesser extent the contract counterparty’s credit risk and our nonperformance risk the determination of the credit risk input is highly subjective and is primarily based on credit default swap spreads including indexes of comparable securities and management’s knowledge of current credit spreads in the debt market as of december 31 2008 a 50 basis point change in our credit spread would change the fair value of our interest rate swaps by less than one percent 

as of december 31 2008 our outstanding forwardstarting interest rate swaps had a combined notional amount of 53 billion and totaled 5981 million on a settlement basis in addition we have two interest rate swaps with a combined notional amount of 6250 million and which totaled 181 million on a settlement basis as of december 31 2008 we have recorded 4352 million net of tax in aoci related to interest rate swaps designated as hedges during 2008 we recorded 222 million net of tax in earnings related to interest rate swaps not designated as hedges and 25 million net of tax related to hedge ineffectiveness

deferred income taxes we record deferred income tax assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet related to events that impact our financial statements and tax returns in different periods in order to compute these deferred tax balances we first analyze the differences between the book basis and tax basis of our assets and liabilities referred to as “temporary differences” these temporary differences are then multiplied by current tax rates to arrive at the balances for the deferred income tax assets and liabilities a valuation allowance is provided on deferred tax assets if it is determined that it is more likely than not that the asset will not be realized we recognize a tax position if it is more likely than not it will be sustained upon examination the tax position is measured at the largest amount that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 

the change in our net deferred income tax balances during a period generally results in a deferred income tax provision or benefit in our consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income loss if our expectations about the future tax consequences of past events should prove to be inaccurate the balances of our deferred income tax assets and liabilities could require significant adjustments in future periods such adjustments could cause a material effect on our results of operations for the period of the adjustment see note 8 to our consolidated financial statements 

impact of accounting standards issued but not yet adopted and those adopted in 2008 

in september 2006 the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 157 “sfas 157” fair value measurements  which defines fair value establishes a framework for measuring fair value in gaap and expands disclosures about fair value measurements on january 1 2008 we adopted the provisions of sfas 157 with the exception of a oneyear deferral of implementation for nonfinancial assets and liabilities that are not recognized or disclosed at fair value on a recurring basis at least annually the requirements of sfas 157 were applied prospectively as a result of the adoption of sfas 157 the interest rate swap fair value as of december 31 2008 included 750 million related to the combined impact of counterparty and our credit risk we are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of fas 157 as of january 1 2009 on our nonfinancial assets and liabilities that are not recognized or disclosed at fair value on a recurring basis 

in december 2007 the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 160 “sfas 160” “ noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements—an amendment to accounting research bulletin no 51 ” sfas 160 amends accounting research bulletin no 51 to establish accounting and reporting standards 

  

index to financial statements for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary sfas 160 clarifies that a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary is an ownership interest in the consolidated entity that should be reported as equity in the consolidated financial statements sfas 160 requires consolidated net income to be reported at amounts that include the amounts attributable to both the parent and the noncontrolling interest the provisions of sfas 160 are effective for us as of january 1 2009 we expect that the adoption of sfas 160 will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements although we will prospectively record the income or losses applicable to the noncontrolling interest of ccal even if their share of the ccal cumulative losses exceeds their equity interests 

in december 2007 the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 141r “sfas 141r” business combinations revised 2007 sfas 141r replaces statement of financial accounting standards no 141 “sfas 141” business combinations  sfas 141r establishes principles and requirements for recognizing and measuring identifiable assets and goodwill acquired liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in an acquisition at their fair value as of the acquisition date sfas 141r will change the accounting treatment of certain items including 1 acquisition and restructuring costs will be generally expensed as incurred 2 noncontrolling interests will be valued at fair value at the acquisition date 3 acquired contingent liabilities will be recorded at fair value at the acquisition date and subsequently measured at either the higher of such amount or the amount determined under existing guidance for nonacquired contingencies and 4 changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances and income tax uncertainties after the acquisition date will affect provision for income taxes the provisions of sfas 141r are applied prospectively to our business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after january 1 2009 sfas 141r may have a material impact on business combinations after adoption the impact from application of sfas 141r depends on the facts and circumstances of the business combinations after adoption 

see note 1 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of recently issued accounting standards and the related impact on our consolidated financial statements 

nongaap financial measures 

our measurement of profit or loss currently used to evaluate the operating performance of our operating segments is earnings before interest taxes depreciation amortization and accretion as adjusted or adjusted ebitda our definition of adjusted ebitda is set forth in “ item 7 mda—results of operations—comparison of operating segments ” our measure of adjusted ebitda may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies including companies in the tower sector and as used in the historical financial statements of global signal and is not a measure of performance calculated in accordance with gaap adjusted ebitda should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for operating income or loss net income or loss cash flows provided by used for operating investing and financing activities or other income statement or cash flow statement data prepared in accordance with gaap 

we believe adjusted ebitda is useful to an investor in evaluating our operating performance because 

 

  

  

  

  

   

index to financial statements our management uses adjusted ebitda 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 there are material limitations to using a measure such as adjusted ebitda including the difficulty associated with comparing results among more than one company including our competitors and the inability to analyze certain significant items including depreciation and interest expense that directly affect our net income or loss management compensates for these limitations by considering the economic effect of the excluded expense items independently as well as in connection with their analysis of net income loss

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend our primary exposures to market risks are related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates which may adversely affect our results of operations and financial position we seek to manage exposure to changes in interest rates where economically prudent to do so by utilizing predominately fixed rate debt and interest rate swaps we do not currently hedge against foreign currency exchange risks 

interest rate risk 

our interest rate risk relates primarily to the impact of interest rate movements on the following inclusive of the 9 senior notes issued january 2009 and the purchase of debt in january and february 2009 1 the anticipated refinancing of the vast majority of our existing 68 billion of debt 2 our 8080 million of floating rate debt representing 12 of our total debt and 3 potential future borrowings of incremental debt the following discussion and tables below summarize our market risk exposure to interest rates including our use of interest rate swaps to manage and reduce this risk see also “item 1a risk factors” 

by the end of 2011 we expect to have refinanced a substantial amount of our outstanding debt and we have entered into interest rate swaps to hedge the variability in cash flows from changes in libor on these anticipated refinancings we do not hedge our exposure to changes in credit spreads on these anticipated refinancings as the rates fixed by our interest rate swaps are exclusive of any credit spread we typically do not hedge our exposure to interest rates on potential future borrowings of additional debt for a substantial period prior to issuance the current credit environment has resulted in a significant widening of credit spreads in the market since the original issuance of our existing debt unless the credit markets improve our prospective debt financings will likely have higher costs including in 2010 and 2011 when we anticipate refinancing a significant portion of our debt in addition if our tower revenue notes are not paid in full by their anticipated repayment dates june 2010 or november 2011 then the interest rate increases by an additional approximately 5 per annum 

we have managed our exposure to market interest rates on our existing debt by 1 controlling the mix of fixed and floating rate debt and 2 utilizing interest rate swaps to hedge variability in cash flows from changes in libor on our outstanding floating rate debt as of december 31 2008 we had 8080 million of floating rate debt of which 6250 million is effectively converted to a fixed rate through an interest rate swap until december 2009 as a result a hypothetical unfavorable fluctuation in market interest rates on our existing debt of one percentage point over a twelvemonth period would increase our interest expense by approximately 18 million 

  

index to financial statements a hypothetical decrease of 50 basis points in the prevailing libor yield curve as of december 31 2008 would increase the liability for our swaps by nearly 140 million we are exposed to nonperformance risk from the counterparties to our interest rate swaps in october 2008 a subsidiary of lehman brothers that was our counterparty for two interest rate swaps filed for bankruptcy these two interest rate swaps have a combined notional value of 475 million and represent a liability of approximately 463 million as of december 31 2008 our other interest rate swaps are with morgan stanley and the royal bank of scotland plc who have credit ratings of “a” or better see note 6 to our consolidated financial statements and the tables below 

as of february 17 2009 the fair value of debt was 63 billion representing an amount less than carrying value of approximately 422 million compared to an amount less than carrying value of approximately 13 billion at december 31 2008 as of february 17 2009 the settlement value of interest rate swaps was a liability of 5205 million a decrease of 957 million from december 31 2008 

  

index to financial statements the following tables provide information about our market risk related to changes in interest rates the future principal payments weightedaverage interest rates and the interest rate swaps are presented as of december 31 2008 after giving effect to 1 the extension of the revolving credit facility maturity to january 2010 from january 2009 2 purchases of debt in january and february 2009 and 3 issuance of the 9 senior notes in january 2009 exclusive of the impact of using the proceeds to make future purchases and repayments of debt these debt maturities reflect contractual maturity dates and do not consider the impact of the principal payments that will commence following the anticipated repayment dates on the tower revenue notes see footnote b see note 6 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our debt and interest rate swaps 

 

  

  

           

index to financial statements foreign currency risk 

the vast majority of our foreign currency risk is related to the australian dollar which is the functional currency of ccal ccal represented 6 of both our consolidated revenues and operating income for 2008 as of february 17 2009 the australian dollar exchange rate had declined approximately 24 from the average rate for 2008 if the foreign currency exchange rate had been 065 for 2008 our consolidated revenues and operating income would have been reduced by approximately 21 million and 4 million respectively 

foreign exchange markets have recently been volatile and we expect foreign exchange markets to continue to be volatile over the near term we believe the risk related to our financial instruments exclusive of intercompany financing deemed a longterm investment denominated in australian dollars should not be material to our financial condition however our revenues and costs have been and will continue to be impacted by changes in the australian dollar exchange rates

 item 1 business 

overview 

we own operate and lease towers and other communication structures including certain rooftop installations collectively “towers” for wireless communications our core business is renting space on our towers via longterm contracts in various forms including license sublease and lease agreements generally our towers can accommodate multiple customers “colocation” for antennas and other equipment necessary for the transmission of wireless signals for mobile telephones and other devices revenues derived from this site rental business represented 93 of our 2007 consolidated revenues 

information concerning our tower portfolio as of december 31 2007 is as follows 

 

  

  

  

  

 our site rental revenues typically result from longterm contracts with 1 initial terms of five to ten years 2 multiple renewal periods at the option of the tenant of five to ten years each and 3 contractual escalators of the rental price as a result the vast majority of our site rental revenues is of a recurring nature and has been contracted for in a prior year we seek to increase our site rental revenues by adding more tenants on our existing towers which should result in significant incremental cash flow due to our relatively fixed tower operating costs 

to a much lesser extent we also provide certain network services relating to our towers including antenna installations and subsequent augmentation network design and site selection site acquisition site development and other services 

  

index to financial statements strategy 

our strategy is to increase longterm shareholder value by translating anticipated future growth in our core site rental business into growth of our results of operations on a per share basis we believe our strategy is consistent with our mission to deliver the highest level of service to our customers at all times – striving to be their critical partner as we assist them in growing efficient ubiquitous wireless networks the key elements of our strategy are to 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 our strategy is based on our belief that opportunities will be created by the expected continuation of growth in the wireless communications industry which depends on the demand for wireless telephony and data services by consumers the following is a discussion of certain growth trends in the wireless communications industry 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

index to financial statements 2007 highlights and recent developments 

during 2007 we engaged in a number of significant activities consistent with our strategy including 1 the global signal merger and the related 18 billion of mortgage loans 2 purchases of our common stock and 3 the lease of our 16701675 mhz us nationwide spectrum license “spectrum” previously utilized by our modeo business the global signal merger which nearly doubled our tower portfolio is discussed below under “item 1 the company—ccusa” see “item 7 mda” and our consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of these and other activities occurring in 2007 and the beginning of 2008 

the company 

we operate our business primarily in the us including puerto rico and australia with nominal operations in canada and the united kingdom “uk” we conduct our operations principally through subsidiaries of crown castle operating company “ccoc” including 1 certain subsidiaries which operate our tower portfolios in the us puerto rico and canada collectively referred to as “ccusa” and 2 a 776 owned subsidiary that operates our australia tower portfolio referred to as “ccal” for more information about our operating segments including the reclassification of the corporate office and other segment and the emerging businesses segment into our ccusa segment as well as financial information about the geographic areas in which we operate see note 18 to our consolidated financial statements and “item 7 mda  ” 

ccusa 

overview the core business of ccusa is the renting of antenna space on our towers to a variety of tenants under longterm contracts supporting our competitive position in the site rental business we offer our tenants certain network services relating to our towers including antenna installations and other services at december 31 2007 ccusa owned leased or managed approximately 22400 towers including rooftop installations although we own lease or manage approximately 250 towers located in puerto rico and canada that are included in ccusa our towers are predominately located in the us with concentrations in the 50 and 100 largest btas 

most of our ccusa towers were acquired through transactions consummated within the past eight years including through the transactions summarized below 

 

  

      on october 5 2006 we entered into a definitive agreement which contemplated the merger of global signal into a whollyowned subsidiary of ours pursuant to the merger agreement on january 12 2007 global signal was merged with and into a whollyowned subsidiary of ours in a stock and cash transaction valued at approximately 40 billion exclusive of debt of approximately 18 billion having a structure similar to our tower revenue notes that remained outstanding as obligations following the global signal merger see note 7 to our consolidated 

  

index to financial statements financial statements as a result of the completion of global signal merger we issued approximately 981 million shares of common stock and paid the maximum 5500 million in cash “gs 550m consideration” to the stockholders of global signal and reserved for issuance approximately 06 million shares of common stock issuable pursuant to global signal warrants see “item 7 mda—general overview—acquisition of global signal” and note 2 to our consolidated financial statements 

as a result of the global signal merger we acquired 10749 additional towers which are located predominately in the us of such 10749 towers 6553 towers “sprint towers” are leased including managed for a period of 32 years through may 2037 under master leases and subleases “sprint master leases” with sprint corporation a predecessor of sprint nextel and certain subsidiaries of sprint corporation entered into in may 2005 global signal prepaid the rent owed under the sprint master leases in may 2005 during the period commencing one year prior to the expiration of the sprint master leases and ending 120 days prior to expiration we have the option to purchase all but not less than all of the sprint towers then leased for approximately 23 billion we are entitled to all revenue from the sprint towers during the term of the sprint master leases including amounts payable under existing leases with third parties in addition under the sprint master leases certain sprint corporation subsidiaries have agreed to sublease space on substantially all of the sprint towers for an initial period through may 2015 the sprint master leases remain effective as our assets and commitments following the closing of the global signal merger 

site rental ccusa rents space on its towers for antennas and other equipment necessary for the transmission of wireless signals to a variety of carriers operating cellular personal communications services “pcs” enhanced specialized mobile radio 3g wireless data paging fixed pointtopoint radio and point to multipoint broadcasting such as radio and television broadcasting 

we generally receive monthly rental payments from tenants payable under site leases recently our new leases at ccusa typically have original terms of seven to ten years with three or four optional renewal periods of five years each and provide for annual price increases based upon a consumer price index a fixed percentage or a combination thereof the lease agreements with our tenants relating to tower network acquisitions generally have an original term of ten years with multiple renewal options at the option of the tenant each typically ranging from five to ten years we have existing master lease agreements with most major wireless carriers including sprint nextel att verizon wireless and tmobile which provide certain terms including economic terms that govern leases on our towers entered into by such parties during the term of their master lease agreements 

the average monthly rental payment of a new tenant added to a tower varies among the different regions in the us and the type of service being provided by the tenant with broadband tenants such as pcs paying more than narrowband tenants such as paging primarily as a result of the physical size of the antenna installation we also routinely receive rental payment increases in connection with lease amendments which authorize carriers to add additional antennas or other equipment to towers on which they already have equipment pursuant to preexisting lease agreements 

the majority of the operating costs of our site rental business consists of ground lease expense property taxes repairs and maintenance utilities insurance and salaries which tend to escalate at approximately the rate of inflation as a result of the relative fixed nature of these costs the colocation of additional tenants is achieved at a low incremental cost resulting in high incremental cash flows 

network services we also provide network services on a limited basis primarily relating to our towers for our tenants our service offerings consist of antenna installations and subsequent augmentation network design and site selection site acquisition site development and other services we have the capability and expertise to install with the assistance of our network of subcontractors equipment and antenna systems for our customers these activities are typically nonrecurring and highly competitive with a number of local competitors in most markets we typically bill for our antenna installation services on a fixed price basis network services revenues are received primarily from wireless communications companies or their agents 

  

index to financial statements customers in both the site rental and network services businesses we work with a number of customers we work extensively with large national wireless carriers such as sprint nextel att verizon wireless and tmobile although emerging and second tier wireless carriers such as those offering wireless data technologies and flat rate calling plans represent only a modest portion of our revenues for 2007 we experienced an increase in new tenant additions from emerging and second tier wireless carriers in 2007 the following table summarizes the net revenues from our four largest customers expressed as a percentage of ccusa’s and our consolidated revenues for 2007 see “ item 1a risk factors ” 

 

 sales and marketing the ccusa sales organization markets our towers within the wireless communications industry with the objective of renting space on existing towers and preselling capacity on our new towers prior to construction we seek to become the critical partner and preferred independent tower provider for our customers and increase customer satisfaction relative to our peers 

we use public and proprietary databases to develop targeted marketing programs focused on carrier network buildouts modifications site additions and network services information about carriers’ existing location of antenna space leases marketing strategies capital spend plans deployment status and actual wireless carrier signal strength measurements taken in the field is analyzed to match specific towers in our portfolios with potential new site demand we have developed a patented webbased tool that stores key tower information above and beyond normal property management information including data on actual customer signal strength demographics site readiness and competitive structures in addition the webbased tool assists us in estimating potential demand for our towers with greater speed and accuracy through these and other tools we have developed we seek to have proactive discussions with our customers regarding their wireless infrastructure deployment plans and the timing and location of their demand for our towers 

a team of national account directors maintains our relationships with our largest customers these directors work to develop new tower leasing opportunities network services contracts and site management opportunities as well as to ensure that customers’ tower needs are efficiently translated into new leases on our towers sales personnel in our area offices develop and maintain local relationships with carriers that are expanding their networks entering new markets bringing new technologies to market or requiring maintenance or addon business in addition to our fulltime sales and marketing staff a number of senior managers and officers spend a significant portion of their time on sales and marketing activities and call on existing and prospective customers 

competition ccusa competes with 1 other independent tower owners which also provide site rental and network services 2 wireless carriers which build own and operate their own tower networks 3 broadcasters with respect to their broadcast towers 4 building owners that rent antenna space on rooftop sites and 5 other potential competitors such as utilities and outdoor advertisers some of which actively participate in the site rental industry wireless carriers that own and operate their own tower networks generally are substantially larger and have greater financial resources than we have we believe that tower location and capacity deployment speed quality of service and price have been and will continue to be the most significant competitive factors affecting the leasing of a tower 

some of the larger independent tower companies with which ccusa competes in the us include american tower corporation sba communications corporation and global tower partners significant additional site rental competition comes from the renting of rooftops utility structures and other alternative sites for antennas 

  

index to financial statements competitors in the network services business include site acquisition consultants zoning consultants real estate firms rightofway consulting firms construction companies tower owners and managers radio frequency engineering consultants telecommunications equipment vendors who can provide turnkey site development services through multiple subcontractors and our customers’ internal staffs we believe that carriers base their decisions on the outsourcing of network services on criteria such as a company’s experience track record local reputation price and time for completion of a project 

ccal 

our primary business in australia is the renting of antenna space on towers to our customers ccal is owned 776 by us and 224 by permanent nominees aust ltd acting on behalf of a group of professional and institutional investors led by jump capital limited ccal is the largest independent tower operator in australia as of december 31 2007 ccal had approximately 1400 towers with a strategic presence in each of australia’s major metropolitan areas including sydney melbourne brisbane adelaide and perth ccal also provides a range of services including site maintenance and property management services for towers owned by third parties 

for the year ended december 31 2007 ccal comprised 6 of our consolidated net revenues ccal’s principal customers are optus vodafone telstra and hutchison for the year ended december 31 2007 these four carriers accounted for approximately 95 of ccal’s revenues with optus and vodafone accounting for 34 and 30 respectively 

the majority of ccal’s towers were acquired from optus in 2000 and vodafone in 2001 in connection with these transactions optus agreed to rent space on the former optus towers for an initial term of 15 years and vodafone agreed to rent space on the former vodafone towers for an initial rent free term of ten years 

in australia ccal competes with wireless carriers which own and operate their own tower networks service companies that provide site maintenance and property management services and other site owners such as broadcasters and building owners the two other significant tower owners in australia are broadcast australia an independent operator of broadcast towers and telstra a wireless carrier we believe that tower location capacity quality of service deployment speed and price within a geographic market are the most significant competitive factors affecting the leasing of a tower 

several 3g networks continue to be developed in australia by ccal’s major customers each of these 3g networks has already utilized a number of our towers in connection with its deployment and we expect more of our towers will be utilized by each of these networks in 2008 in addition broadband wireless networks continue to be deployed including a planned network to serve rural australia 

employees 

at february 19 2008 we employed approximately 1200 people worldwide we are not a party to any collective bargaining agreements we have not experienced any strikes or work stoppages and management believes that our employee relations are satisfactory 

regulatory matters 

to date we have not incurred any material fines or penalties or experienced any material adverse effects to our business as a result of any domestic or international regulations the summary below is based on regulations currently in effect and such regulations are subject to review and modification by the applicable governmental authority from time to time if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations we may be fined or even lose our rights to conduct some of our business 

united states 

federal regulations both the fcc and the federal aviation administration “faa” regulate towers used for wireless communications radio and television broadcasting such regulations control the siting lighting and marking of towers and may depending on the characteristics of particular towers require the registration of tower facilities with the fcc and the issuance of determinations confirming no hazard to air traffic wireless communications devices operating on towers are separately regulated and independently licensed based upon the particular frequency used in addition the fcc and the faa have developed standards to consider proposals for 

  

index to financial statements new or modified tower and antenna structures based upon the height and location including proximity to airports proposals to construct or to modify existing tower and antenna structures above certain heights are reviewed by the faa to ensure the structure will not present a hazard to aviation which determination may be conditioned upon compliance with lighting and marking requirements the fcc requires its licensees to operate communications devices only on towers that comply with faa rules and are registered with the fcc if required by its regulations where tower lighting is required by faa regulation tower owners bear the responsibility of notifying the faa of any tower lighting outage and ensuring the timely restoration of such outages failure to comply with the applicable requirements may lead to civil penalties 

local regulations the us telecommunications act of 1996 amended the communications act of 1934 to preserve state and local zoning authorities’ jurisdiction over the siting of communications towers the law however limits local zoning authority by prohibiting actions by local authorities that discriminate between different service providers of wireless services or ban altogether the provision of wireless services additionally the law prohibits state and local restrictions based on the environmental effects of radio frequency emissions to the extent the facilities comply with fcc regulations 

local regulations include city and other local ordinances including subdivision and zoning ordinances approvals for construction modification and removal of towers and restrictive covenants imposed by community developers these regulations vary greatly but typically require us to obtain approval from local officials prior to tower construction local zoning authorities may render decisions that prevent the construction or modification of towers or place conditions on such construction or modifications that are responsive to community residents’ concerns regarding the height visibility and other characteristics of the towers decisions of local zoning authorities may also adversely affect the timing and cost of tower construction and modification 

other regulations we hold through certain of our subsidiaries certain licenses for radio transmission facilities granted by the fcc including licenses for common carrier microwave service commercial and private mobile radio service specialized mobile radio and paging service which are subject to additional regulation by the fcc our fcc license relating to the spectrum contains certain conditions related to the services that may be provided thereunder the technical equipment used in connection therewith and the circumstances under which it may be renewed we are required to obtain the fcc’s approval prior to assigning or transferring control of our fcc licenses 

australia 

federal regulations carrier licenses and nominated carrier declarations issued under the australian telecommunications act 1997 authorize the use of network units for the supply of telecommunications services to the public the definition of “network units” includes line links and base stations used for wireless telephony services but does not include tower infrastructure accordingly ccal as a tower owner and operator does not require a carrier license under the australian telecommunications act 1997 similarly because ccal does not own any transmitters or spectrum it does not currently require any apparatus or spectrum licenses issued under the australian radiocommunications act 1992 

carriers have a statutory obligation to provide other carriers with access to towers and if there is a dispute including a pricing dispute the matter may be referred to the australian competition and consumer commission for resolution as a noncarrier ccal is not subject to this regime and our customers negotiate site access on a commercial basis 

while the australian telecommunications act 1997 grants certain exemptions from planning laws for the installation of “low impact facilities” newly constructed towers are expressly excluded from the definition of “low impact facilities” accordingly in connection with the construction of towers ccal is subject to state and local planning laws which vary on a site by site basis structural enhancements may be undertaken on behalf of a carrier without state and local planning approval under the general “maintenance power” under the australian telecommunications act 1997 although these enhancements may be subject to state and local planning laws if ccal is unable to obtain carrier cooperation to use that legislative power for a limited number of towers ccal is also required to install aircraft warning lighting in compliance with federal aviation regulations in australia a carrier may arguably be able to utilize the “maintenance power” under the australian telecommunications act of 1997 to remain as a tenant on a tower after the expiration of a site license or sublease however ccal’s customer access agreements generally limit the ability of customers to do this and even if a carrier did utilize this power the 

  

index to financial statements carrier would be required to pay for ccal’s financial loss which would roughly equal the site rental revenues that would have otherwise been payable 

local regulations in australia there are various local state and territory laws and regulations which relate to among other things town planning and zoning restrictions standards and approvals for the design construction or alteration of a structure or facility and environmental regulations as in the us these laws vary greatly but typically require tower owners to obtain approval from governmental bodies prior to tower construction and to comply with environmental laws on an ongoing basis 

environmental matters 

to date we have not incurred any material fines or penalties or experienced any material adverse effects to our business as a result of any domestic or international environmental regulations or matters see “item 1a risk factors” 

the construction of new towers in the us may be subject to environmental review under the national environmental policy act of 1969 as amended “nepa” which requires federal agencies to evaluate the environmental impact of major federal actions the fcc has promulgated regulations implementing nepa which require applicants to investigate the potential environmental impact of the proposed tower construction should the proposed tower construction present a significant environmental impact the fcc must prepare an environmental impact statement subject to public comment if a proposed tower may have a significant impact on the environment the fcc’s approval of the construction could be significantly delayed 

our operations are subject to federal state and local laws and regulations relating to the management use storage disposal emission and remediation of and exposure to hazardous and nonhazardous substances materials and wastes as an owner lessee or operator of real property we are subject to certain environmental laws that impose strict jointandseveral liability for the cleanup of onsite or offsite contamination relating to existing or historical operations and we could also be subject to personal injury or property damage claims relating to such contamination we are potentially subject to environmental and cleanup liabilities in the us including puerto rico and australia 

as licensees and tower owners we are also subject to regulations and guidelines that impose a variety of operational requirements relating to radio frequency emissions as employers we are subject to osha and similar occupational health and safety legislation in australia and similar guidelines regarding employee protection from radio frequency exposure the potential connection between radio frequency emissions and certain negative health effects including some forms of cancer has been the subject of substantial study by the scientific community in recent years 

we have compliance programs and monitoring projects to help assure that we are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws nevertheless there can be no assurance that the costs of compliance with existing or future environmental laws will not have a material adverse effect on us 

  

index to financial statements tablestart 


 item 1a risk factors tableend you should carefully consider the risks described below as well as the other information contained in this document when evaluating your investment in our securities 

our business depends on the demand for wireless communications and towers and we may be adversely affected by any slowdown in such demand 

demand for our towers depends on the demand for antenna space from our customers which in turn depends on the demand for wireless telephony and data services by their customers the willingness of our customers to utilize our infrastructure or renew existing leases on our towers is affected by numerous factors including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 a slowdown in demand for wireless communications or our towers may negatively impact our revenues result in an impairment of our assets or otherwise have a material adverse effect on us 

a substantial portion of our revenues is derived from a small number of customers and the loss consolidation or financial instability of or network sharing among any of our limited number of customers may materially decrease revenues 

for the year ended december 31 2007 approximately 68 of our consolidated revenue was derived from sprint nextel att verizon wireless and tmobile which represented 25 19 15 and 9 respectively of our consolidated net revenues the loss of any one of our large customers as a result of bankruptcy insolvency consolidation merger with other customers of ours or otherwise may materially decrease our revenues and have other adverse effects on our business we cannot guarantee that the leases including management agreements with our major wireless carriers will not be terminated or that these carriers will renew such agreements 

wireless carriers frequently enter into agreements with their competitors allowing them to utilize one another’s towers to accommodate customers who are out of range of their home providers’ services in addition wireless carriers have also entered into agreements allowing two or more carriers to share a single wireless network or jointly develop a tower portfolio in certain locations such agreements may be viewed by wireless carriers as a superior alternative to renting space for their own antennas on our towers the proliferation of these roaming network sharing and joint development agreements may have a material adverse effect on us 

consolidation among our customers may result in duplicate or overlapping parts of networks which may result in a reduction of sites and have a negative effect on revenues and cash flows 

consolidation among our customers will likely result in duplicate or overlapping parts of networks which may result in a reduction of cell sites and impact revenues from our towers in the last several years certain of our larger carrier customers have merged including cingular wireless now known as att with att wireless in october 2004 and sprint with nextel in august 2005 any industry consolidation could decrease the demand for our towers which in turn may result in a reduction in our revenues and cash flows 

  

index to financial statements our substantial level of indebtedness may adversely affect our ability to react to changes in our business and we may be limited in our ability to refinance our existing debt or use debt to fund future capital needs 

we have a substantial amount of indebtedness approximately 61 billion as of february 19 2008 as a result of our substantial debt demands on our cash resources are higher than they otherwise would be which could negatively impact our business results of operations and financial condition and the market price of our common stock 

as a result of our substantial indebtedness 

 

  

  

  

  

 we anticipate refinancing the majority if not all of our debt and preferred stock within the next five years if our tower revenue notes are not repaid in full by their anticipated repayment dates five years from original issuance then our interest rates substantially increase by an additional 5 per annum and monthly principal payments commence our mortgage loans have contractual maturities in december 2009 and february 2011 there can be no assurances we will be able to effect this anticipated refinancing on commercially reasonable terms or on terms including with respect to interest rates as favorable as our current debt and preferred stock if we are unable to refinance or renegotiate our debt our debt service requirements may significantly increase in the future 

in early 2007 a crisis began in the sub prime mortgage sector as a result of rising delinquencies and credit quality deterioration and has subsequently spread throughout the credit market in addition to a lack of liquidity in the general credit markets the current credit crisis has resulted in a widening of credit spreads in the market place in general and for us specifically there can be no assurances that this credit crisis will not worsen or impact our availability and cost of debt financing including with respect to any refinancings see “item 7 mda—liquidity and capital resources—factors affecting sources of liquidity” 

a wireless communications industry slowdown may materially and adversely affect our business including reducing demand for our towers and network services and the business of our customers 

in past years the wireless communications industry has periodically experienced significant general slowdowns which negatively affected the factors described in these risk factors influencing demand for tower space and network services similar slowdowns in the future may reduce consumer demand for wireless services or negatively impact the debt and equity markets thereby causing carriers to delay or abandon implementation of new systems and technologies 

as a result of competition in our industry including from some competitors with significantly more resources or less debt than we have we may find it more difficult to achieve favorable rental rates on our towers 

we face competition for site rental customers from various sources including 

 

  

  

  

  

   

index to financial statements wireless carriers that own and operate their own tower portfolios are generally substantially larger and have greater financial resources than we have competition for tenants on towers may adversely affect rental rates and revenues 

new technologies may significantly reduce demand for our towers and negatively impact our revenues 

improvements in the efficiency of wireless networks could reduce the demand for our towers for example signal combining technologies that permit one antenna to service multiple frequencies and thereby multiple customers may reduce the need for our towers in addition other technologies such as wireless mesh networks voiceoverwifi femtocells satellite transmission systems such as low earth orbiting and distributed antenna systems may in the future serve as substitutes for or alternatives to leasing that might otherwise be anticipated or expected on our towers had such technologies not existed any significant reduction in tower leasing demand resulting from the previously mentioned technologies or other technologies may negatively impact our revenues or otherwise have a material adverse effect on us 

new wireless technologies may not deploy or be adopted by customers as rapidly or in the manner projected 

there can be no assurances that 3g wireless data services such as email internet and mobile video or other new wireless technologies will be introduced or deployed as rapidly or in the manner projected by the wireless or broadcast industries in addition demand and customer adoption rates for such new technologies may be lower or slower than anticipated for numerous reasons as a result growth opportunities and demand for our towers as a result of such technologies may not be realized at the times or to the extent anticipated 

if we fail to retain rights to the land under our towers our business may be adversely affected 

our real property interests relating to the land on which our towers reside consist primarily of leasehold and subleasehold interests fee interests easements licenses and rightsofway a loss of these interests may interfere with our ability to conduct our business and generate revenues for various reasons we may not always have the ability to access analyze and verify all information regarding titles and other issues prior to completing an acquisition of towers further we may not be able to renew ground leases on commercially viable terms our ability to retain rights to the land on which our towers reside depends on our ability to renegotiate and extend the terms of the ground leases subleases and licenses relating to the land on which our towers reside or purchase the land on which such towers reside approximately 12 of our towers are on land where our property interests in such land have a final expiration date of less than ten years our inability to retain rights to the land on which our towers reside may have a material adverse affect on us 

if we are unable to raise capital in the future when needed we may not be able to fund future growth opportunities 

we may need additional sources of debt or equity capital in the future to fund strategic growth opportunities additional financing may be unavailable may be prohibitively expensive or may be restricted by the terms of our outstanding indebtedness additional sales of equity securities would dilute our existing stockholders if we are unable to raise capital when our needs arise we may not be able to fund future growth opportunities 

fibertower’s business has certain risk factors different from our core tower business including an unproven business model and may produce results that are less than anticipated resulting in a writeoff of all or part of our investment in fibertower 

fibertower has an unproven business model and operates in the new and largely untested market for facilitiesbased wireless backhaul services as such fibertower is subject to all of the business risks and uncertainties associated with any new business enterprise and may not be able to operate successfully fibertower has generated losses since inception we anticipate that fibertower will continue to generate losses for the foreseeable future and may need additional funding to support the development of its business model although we believe that there will be demand for backhaul by wireless carriers as the demand for additional wireless minutes of use increases no assurances can be made that fibertower will ever generate positive cash flows or that it will produce the results anticipated at the time of our investment additional risk factors relating to fibertower’s business can be found in fibertower’s filings with the sec 

  

index to financial statements for the quarter ended september 30 2007 fibertower recorded an impairment charge of 614 million after concluding that the carrying value of its goodwill was impaired for the year ended december 31 2007 we recorded an impairment charge to earnings of 756 million related to the writedown of the value of our investment in fibertower as a result of a decline in value deemed otherthantemporary fibertower’s failure to operate successfully gain market share or accomplish its strategic objectives could negatively impact fibertower’s per share price and could require us to record additional writedowns of a portion or all of our investment in fibertower the potential future writedowns are limited to the carrying value of this investment of 601 million as of december 31 2007 

our lease relating to our spectrum has certain risk factors different from our core tower business including that the spectrum lease may not be renewed or continued that the option to acquire the spectrum license may not be exercised and that the spectrum may not be deployed which may result in the revenues derived from the spectrum being less than those that may otherwise have been anticipated 

we entered into a lease as lessor relating to the spectrum rights we acquired in 2003 pursuant to an fcc license our spectrum lease has an initial term for a 13 million annual lease fee beginning july 23 2007 until october 1 2013 upon the expiration of the initial term of the lease the lessee will have the right to acquire the spectrum for 130 million with a consumer price index adjustment from july 2007 or to renew the lease for a period of up to ten years on the same terms subject to the annual lease fee increasing to 143 million the lessee’s right to renew the lease or acquire the spectrum following the initial term is subject to fcc license renewal and approval which may not be obtained in the event that the lessee defaults on the spectrum lease that the option to acquire the spectrum license or renew the spectrum lease is not exercised or that the spectrum is not deployed the revenues derived from the spectrum may be substantially less than anticipated 

if we fail to comply with laws or regulations which regulate our business and which may change at any time we may be fined or even lose our right to conduct some of our business 

a variety of federal state local and foreign laws and regulations apply to our business failure to comply with applicable requirements may lead to civil penalties or require us to assume indemnification obligations or breach contractual provisions we cannot guarantee that existing or future laws or regulations including state and local tax laws will not adversely affect our business increase delays or result in additional costs these factors may have a material adverse effect on us 

sales or issuances of a substantial number of shares of our common stock may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

future sales of a substantial number of shares of common stock may adversely affect the market price of our common stock as of february 19 2008 we had 2814 million shares of common stock outstanding in addition we reserved 1 171 million shares of common stock for future issuance under our various stock compensation plans 2 59 million shares of common stock for the conversion of our 4 convertible senior notes and 3 86 million shares of common stock for the conversion of our outstanding convertible preferred stock 

a small number of stockholders own a significant percentage of our outstanding common stock if any one of these stockholders or any group of our stockholders sells a large quantity of shares of our common stock or the public market perceives that existing stockholders might sell a large quantity of shares of our common stock the market price of our common stock may significantly decline 

our network services business has historically experienced significant volatility in demand which reduces the predictability of our results 

the operating results of our network services business for any particular period may vary significantly and should not necessarily be considered indicative of longerterm results for this activity in the foreseeable future network services revenues may decline as a percentage of our total revenues due to our focus on our core rental business increased competition or other factors 

  

index to financial statements if radio frequency emissions from wireless handsets or equipment on our towers are demonstrated to cause negative health effects potential future claims could adversely affect our operations costs and revenues 

the potential connection between radio frequency emissions and certain negative health effects including some forms of cancer has been the subject of substantial study by the scientific community in recent years we cannot guarantee that claims relating to radio frequency emissions will not arise in the future or that the results of such studies will not be adverse to us 

public perception of possible health risks associated with cellular and other wireless communications may slow or diminish the growth of wireless companies which may in turn slow or diminish our growth in particular negative public perception of and regulations regarding these perceived health risks may slow or diminish the market acceptance of wireless communications services if a connection between radio emissions and possible negative health effects were established our operations costs and revenues may be materially and adversely affected we currently do not maintain any significant insurance with respect to these matters 

certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation bylaws and operative agreements and domestic and international competition laws may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us or for us to acquire control of a third party even if such a change in control would be beneficial to our stockholders 

we have a number of antitakeover devices in place that will hinder takeover attempts and may reduce the market value of our common stock our antitakeover provisions include 

 

  

  

  

 our bylaws permit special meetings of the stockholders to be called only upon the request of our chief executive officer or a majority of the board of directors and deny stockholders the ability to call such meetings such provisions as well as the provisions of section 203 of the delaware general corporation law may impede a merger consolidation takeover or other business combination or discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us 

in addition domestic and international competition laws may prevent or discourage us from acquiring towers or tower networks in certain geographical areas or impede a merger consolidation takeover or other business combination or discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us 

we may suffer losses due to exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates relating to our operations outside the us 

we conduct business in australia canada and uk which exposes us to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates for the year ended december 31 2007 approximately 6 of our consolidated net revenues originated outside the us all of which were denominated in currencies other than us dollars principally australian dollars we have not historically engaged in significant hedging activities relating to our nonus dollar operations and we may suffer future losses as a result of changes in currency exchange rates

 item 2 properties tableend our principal ccusa corporate offices are located in houston texas and canonsburg pennsylvania and are owned our principal ccal corporate office is located in sydney australia and is leased in the us we also lease and maintain three additional area offices “area offices” located in 1 charlotte north carolina 2 alpharetta georgia and 3 phoenix arizona which are in addition to the area office operated from our canonsburg pennsylvania corporate office the principal responsibilities of these offices are to manage the renting of tower space on a local basis maintain the towers already located in the area and service our customers in the area in addition we lease additional smaller district offices which report to the area offices in locations with high tower concentrations 

towers are vertical metal structures generally ranging in height from 50 to 2000 feet in addition wireless communications equipment may also be placed on building rooftops towers are generally located on tracts of land of up to ten acres these tracts of land support the towers equipment shelters and where applicable guy wires to stabilize the structure 

we are actively 1 renegotiating and extending the terms of the ground leases relating to the land on which towers are located and 2 acquiring the land on which such towers reside for a tabular presentation of the remaining terms to final expiration of the ground leases subleases or licenses for the land which we do not own and on which our towers are located as of december 31 2007 see “ item 7 mda—liquidity and capital resources—contractual cash obligations” 

as of december 31 2007 we owned in fee or had perpetual or longterm easements in the land on which approximately 21 of our ccusa towers reside up from 18 as of december 31 2006 after giving effect to the global signal merger and we leased subleased or licensed the land on which approximately 76 of our ccusa towers reside in addition as of december 31 2007 approximately 3 of our ccusa towers were owned by third parties where we had the right to market space on the tower or where we had sublease arrangements with the tower owner in australia as of december 31 2007 approximately 99 of the site tenure of the land under our ccal towers took the form of a lease or license and we owned the remainder in fee our ground leases subleases and licenses generally have five or ten year initial terms at ccusa and ten to 15 year initial terms at ccal and frequently contain one or more renewal options 

our tower revenue notes issued in 2005 and 2006 are effectively secured by approximately 6700 of our towers and the cash flows from those towers governing documents relating to another approximately 4900 towers prevent liens from being granted on those towers without approval of a subsidiary of verizon however distributions paid from the entities that own those towers will also service the tower revenue notes in addition approximately 9300 of our towers and the cash flows derived from these towers are effectively pledged as security for the mortgage loans see note 7 to our consolidated financial statements 

  

index to financial statements substantially all of our ccusa towers can accommodate another tenant either as currently constructed or with appropriate modifications to the tower additionally if so inclined as a result of customer demand we could generally also tear down an existing tower and reconstruct another tower in its place with additional capacity subject to certain restrictions as of december 31 2007 the weightedaverage number of tenants per tower is approximately 26 on our ccusa towers a summary of the number of existing tenants per ccusa tower as of december 31 2007 is as follows

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend general overview 

overview 

we own operate and lease over 23000 towers for wireless communications including the towers acquired in the global signal merger see “item 7 mda—general overview—acquisition of global signal”  revenues generated from our core site rental business represented 93 of our 2007 consolidated revenues ccusa our largest operating segment accounted for 94 of our 2007 site rental revenues of which 69 were derived from the four largest wireless carriers in the us the vast majority of our site rental revenues is of a recurring nature and has been contracted for in a prior year see “item 1 business” 

the following are certain highlights of our business fundamentals as further discussed in this form 10k including in “item 1 business” and this mda  

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 our strategy is to increase longterm shareholder value by translating anticipated future growth in our core site rental business into growth in our results of operations on a per share basis the key elements of our strategy are see “item 1 business” for further discussion 

 

  

 our strategy is based on our belief that opportunities will be created by the expected continuation of growth in the wireless communications industry which depends on the demand for wireless telephony and data services by consumers as a result of such expected growth in the wireless communications industry we believe that the demand for our towers will continue and result in organic growth of our revenues due to the colocation of additional tenants on our existing towers we expect that new tenant additions or modifications of existing installations collectively referred to as “tenant additions” on our existing towers should result in significant incremental cash flow due to the relatively fixed costs to operate a tower which tend to increase at approximately the rate of inflation the following is a discussion of certain growth trends in the wireless communications industry see “item 1 business” for further discussion 

 

  

  

  

  

   

index to financial statements the impact of anticipated increases to site rental revenues from the demand for antenna space on our towers may be tempered somewhat by recent carrier consolidation including cingular wireless now known as att merging with att wireless in 2004 and sprint merging with nextel in 2005 which could result in duplicate or overlapping networks however we expect that the termination of leases as a result of recent carrier consolidation and related duplicate or overlapping networks will be spread over multiple quarters as existing lease obligations expire in addition we believe we are adding more leases from all of our customers than the total number of leases we believe will eventually be terminated as a result of the two mergers noted above consequently we currently do not believe that lease terminations from carrier consolidation will have a material adverse affect on our results 

slow downs in the us economy including the wireless communication industry may reduce consumer demand for wireless communications cause carriers to delay improvements to network quality and coverage and delay or abandon introduction of next generation wireless technologies which in turn could reduce demand for our towers many commentators have expressed uncertainty about the direction and relative strength of the us economy currently we have not experienced a slow down in new leasing of our towers 

in addition to consumer demand for wireless services as discussed above factors affecting the growth in our revenues include 1 availability and location of our towers and alternative sites 2 availability and cost of capital to our customers 3 our customers’ willingness to colocate 4 local restrictions on the proliferation of towers 5 technological changes affecting the number of communications sites needed to provide wireless communication services to a given geographical area and 6 our ability to efficiently satisfy our customers’ service requirements 

acquisition of global signal 

on january 12 2007 we completed the global signal merger in a stock and cash transaction valued at approximately 40 billion exclusive of debt of approximately 18 billion that remained outstanding as obligations after the global signal merger as a result of the completion of the global signal merger we issued approximately 981 million shares of common stock and paid the maximum cash consideration of 550 million to the stockholders of global signal and reserved for issuance approximately 06 million shares of common stock issuable pursuant to global signal warrants we financed the gs 550m consideration primarily with cash received from the issuance of tower revenue notes in november 2006 we entered into the global signal merger primarily because of anticipated growth opportunities in the global signal tower portfolio including through leveraging our management team and customer service across an enhanced national footprint we believe such opportunities for growth will be driven by the previously mentioned growth trends in the wireless communications industry 

the global signal merger significantly increased our tower portfolio by 10749 towers and significantly impacted the comparability of our results of operations to prior years specifically the global signal merger is primarily responsible for the significant increase between 2006 and 2007 in our site rental revenues site rental costs of operations general and administrative expenses integration costs depreciation amortization and accretion and income tax benefits global signal revenues cost of operations and gross margins for the year ended december 31 2006 were approximately 4960 million 2212 million and 2747 million respectively although the global signal merger resulted in an increase in general and administrative expenses in nominal dollars our general and administrative expenses decreased as a percentage of revenues we incurred costs of 254 million for 2007 related to our integration of global signal’s operations and tower portfolio into our policies procedures operations and systems we anticipate the integration of global signal’s operations and tower portfolio will be completed by the end of the first quarter of 2008 the change from a provision to a benefit for income taxes between 2006 and 2007 was related to our change from a net deferred tax asset position to a net deferred tax liability position that resulted from the deferred tax liability of 5566 million recorded as part of the allocation of the purchase price of the global signal merger offset by the reversal of our federal valuation allowance of 2597 million 

see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of the global signal merger including 1 the allocation of the purchase price and 2 our unaudited pro forma consolidated results of operations for the years ended december 31 2006 and 2007 as if the global signal merger were completed as of the beginning of each such period see also notes 4 5 7 8 and 19 to our consolidated financial statements 

  

index to financial statements results of operations 

the following discussion of our results of operations should be read in conjunction with “item 1 business” “item 7 mda—liquidity and capital resources” and our consolidated financial statements the following discussion of our results of operations is based on consolidated financials statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principals in the us that require us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts see “item 7 mda—accounting and reporting matters—critical accounting policies and estimates” and note 1 to our consolidated financial statements 

the construction and acquisition of towers affects the yeartoyear comparability of our results due to the fact that our results only reflect revenues generated from these towers following the date of their construction or acquisition a large majority of the increase between 2006 and 2007 in our site rental revenues site rental costs of operations general and administrative expenses integration costs depreciation amortization and accretion and income tax benefits is attributable to the global signal merger see “item 7 mda—general overview—acquisition of global signal” in addition to the towers acquired in the global signal merger we built or acquired 483 487 and 188 towers in 2005 2006 and 2007 respectively 

  

index to financial statements comparison of consolidated results 

the following is a comparison of our 2005 2006 and 2007 consolidated results of operations 

 

  

    

index to financial statements 2006 and 2007 our consolidated results of operations for 2006 and 2007 respectively predominately consist of our ccusa segment which accounted for 1 92 and 94 of consolidated net revenues 2 92 and 94 of consolidated gross margins and 3 97 and 102 of consolidated net loss our operating segment results for 2006 and 2007 including ccusa are discussed below see “item 7 mda—results of operations—comparison of operating segments ” 

net revenues for 2007 increased by 5973 million or 76 from 2006 of which site rental revenues represented 99 of the overall increase this increase in site rental revenues was driven by 1 the towers acquired in connection with the global signal merger and to a lesser extent 2 tenant additions on our preglobal signal merger towers occurring during or after 2006 and 3 the 474 towers acquired from mountain union tenant additions were influenced by the previously mentioned growth trends in the wireless communications industry 

site rental gross margins site rental revenues less site rental costs of operations for 2007 increased by 3589 million or 74 from 2006 the increase in the site rental gross margins was predominately driven by the previously mentioned increase in site rental revenues we expect that future increases in site rental revenues resulting from tenant additions on our towers will have a high incremental margin percentage of revenue growth converted to gross margin given the relatively fixed nature of the costs to operate our towers 

in addition the global signal merger resulted in 1 an increase in general and administrative expenses in nominal dollars but a decrease in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues as a result of synergies from operating a larger tower portfolio 2 the vast majority of the increase in depreciation amortization and accretion expense 3 the integration costs for 2007 4 additional interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs relating to the 18 billion of mortgage loans and 5 our recording of income tax benefits resulting from the deferred tax liability recorded in purchase accounting that resulted in a change from a net deferred tax asset position to a net deferred tax liability position 

our net loss for 2007 increased by 1809 million from 2006 predominately due to 1 the net impact of the previously mentioned global signal merger 2 an impairment charge of 756 million relating to our investment in fibertower and 3 asset writedown charges 576 million and restructuring charges 31 million related to modeo totaling 607 million offset by 4 growth in our site rental business on preglobal signal merger towers 

pro forma 2006 and 2007  the following is a discussion of our unaudited pro forma consolidated results of operations as if the global signal merger were completed as of january 1 for the years ended december 31 2006 and 2007 these unaudited pro forma amounts are presented and discussed for illustrative purposes only are not necessarily indicative of future consolidated results of operations and reflect cost savings from the global signal merger in the period in which such cost savings are achieved see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for a presentation of our pro forma condensed consolidated results of operations 

pro forma net revenues for 2007 increased by 1032 million or 8 from 2006 site rental revenues which represented 93 of the overall increase in pro forma net revenues increased by 956 million or 8 from 2006 primarily due to tenant additions across our combined tower portfolio the increase in pro forma site rental revenues was driven by tenant additions across our entire tower portfolio and to a lesser extent the 474 towers acquired from mountain union pro forma site rental gross margins for 2007 increased by 742 million or 10 from 2006 the increase in the pro forma site rental gross margins was related to the previously mentioned increase in site rental revenues 

our pro forma loss from continuing operations for 2007 increased by 758 million from 2006 predominately due to 1 an increase of 860 million in interest expense related to additional borrowings used to fund the gs 550m consideration and purchases of our common stock 2 an impairment charge of 756 million relating to our investment in fibertower and 3 asset writedown charges 576 million and restructuring charges 31 million related to modeo totaling 607 million offset by growth in our site rental business across our combined tower portfolio in addition integration costs of 254 million for 2007 were offset by a decrease in general and administrative expenses of 268 million or 16 from 2006 due predominately to cost synergies achieved as a result of operating a larger tower portfolio 

  

index to financial statements 2005 and 2006 our consolidated results of operations for 2005 and 2006 respectively predominately consist of our ccusa segment which accounted for 1 92 and 92 of consolidated net revenues 2 92 and 92 of consolidated gross margins and 3 98 and 97 of consolidated net loss our operating segment results for 2005 and 2006 including ccusa are discussed below see “item 7 mda—results of operations—comparison of operating segments ” 

net revenues for 2006 increased by 1115 million or 17 from 2005 the increase for 2006 resulted from an increase in site rental revenues of 996 million which represents 89 of the overall increase in net revenues the increase in site rental revenue for 2006 was primarily driven by 1 tenant additions or modifications to existing installations 2 the leases as originally acquired related to the combined 941 towers from trintel and mountain union and 3 an increase in noncash straightline rents primarily relating to the renewal of certain leases 

site rental gross margins site rental revenues less site rental costs of operations for 2006 increased by 845 million or 21 from 2005 the incremental margin is 85 of the related increase in site rental revenues for 2006 the increase in the site rental gross margin percentage and the related high incremental margin percentage was driven by tenant additions on existing towers that did not result in significant incremental tower operating costs due to the relatively fixed nature of the costs to operate our towers 

during 2005 we refinanced 15 billion of our high yield notes with proceeds from the 19 billion tower revenue notes resulting in a reduction in our weightedaverage interest rate and simplification of our capital structure during 2005 we recorded an aggregate loss of 2838 million on the purchase and redemption of the 15 billion high yield notes and a portion of our 4 convertible notes during 2006 we increased our debt by approximately 12 billion or 55 from 2005 primarily by borrowing 155 billion of tower revenue notes in november 2006 which in part refinanced 1 billion of outstanding debt under a credit facility the proceeds of our 2006 borrowings were used to fund purchases of our common stock the gs 550m consideration related to the global signal merger and the acquisition of mountain union the increase in interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs for 2006 of 285 million or 21 from 2005 was driven by the increase in debt partially offset by a reduction in our weighted average interest rates see “item 7 mda—liquidity and capital resources” and note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

net loss for 2006 improved by 3580 million from 2005 the improvement in the net loss was primarily driven by 1 the 2780 million decrease in losses on purchases and redemption of debt related to the refinancing of 16 billion of debt during 2005 2 the 972 million increase in operating income resulting primarily from tenant additions on our towers offset by 3 the 285 million increase in interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs as a result of an increase in our debt partially reduced by the decrease in our weighted average interest rates 

the dividends on preferred stock in 2006 of 208 million are related to our 625 convertible preferred stock the decrease in the preferred stock dividends of 286 million from 2005 relates to the redemption of the 8 1  4  convertible preferred stock in december 2005 see note 10 to our consolidated financial statements 

comparison of operating segments 

our reportable operating segments for 2007 are 1 ccusa primarily consisting of our us including puerto rico tower operations and 2 ccal our australian tower operations our financial results are reported to management and the board of directors in this manner we have reclassified the corporate office and other segment into the ccusa segment reflecting the significance of the ccusa segment to our consolidated business following the global signal merger we have reclassified the emerging businesses segment consisting of our modeo business into the ccusa segment following the lease of the spectrum and writeoff of substantially all of the modeo assets other than the spectrum see note 17 to our consolidated financial statements segment information for all periods has been reclassified to reflect these changes in reportable segments 

see note 18 to our consolidated financial statements for segment results and a reconciliation of net income loss to adjusted ebitda defined below 

our measurement of profit or loss currently used to evaluate our operating performance and operating segments is earnings before interest taxes depreciation amortization and accretion as adjusted “adjusted ebitda” our measure of adjusted ebitda may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies including 

  

index to financial statements companies in the tower sector and is not a measure of performance calculated in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” 

we define adjusted ebitda as net income loss plus restructuring charges credits asset writedown charges integration costs depreciation amortization and accretion losses on purchases and redemptions of debt interest and other income expense interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs impairment of availableforsale securities benefit provision for income taxes minority interests cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle income loss from discontinued operations and stockbased compensation expense see note 12 to our consolidated financial statements the calculation of adjusted ebitda for our operating segments is set forth in note 18 to our consolidated financial statements adjusted ebitda is not intended as an alternative measure of operating results or cash flow from operations as determined in accordance with gaap and adjusted ebitda may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies adjusted ebitda is discussed further under “ item 7 mda — accounting and reporting matters—nongaap financial measures ” 

ccusa—2006 and 2007 net revenues for 2007 increased by 5763 million or 79 from 2006 this increase in net revenues resulted from an increase in site rental revenues of 5709 million or 89 for the same periods this increase in site rental revenues was driven by 1 the towers acquired in connection with the global signal merger and to a lesser extent 2 new tenant additions and 3 the 474 towers acquired from mountain union tenant additions were influenced by the previously mentioned growth in the wireless communications industry although we continue to derive a large portion of our site rental revenues from the four largest carriers in the us we have experienced an increase in tenant additions during 2007 from emerging wireless carriers and second tier carriers such as those offering wireless data technologies and flat rate calling plans 

network services and other revenues for 2007 increased by 54 million or 6 from 2006 the increase in network services and other revenues was as a result of performing services on a larger portfolio of towers due to the global signal merger global signal did not operate a network services business so the network services and other revenues performed on the global signal towers increased during each quarter of 2007 as we began marketing services for those towers exclusive of network services and other revenues derived from the global signal towers network services and other revenues declined modestly from 2006 to 2007 the network services business is typically nonrecurring and the volume of activity can vary significantly from period to period in relation to tenant additions on our towers 

site rental gross margins for 2007 increased by 3456 million or 77 from 2006 the increase in the site rental gross margins was related to the previously mentioned 89 increase in site rental revenues primarily driven by the towers acquired in connection with the global signal merger and to a lesser extent from tenant additions site rental gross margins as a percentage of site rental revenues for 2007 decreased by 42 percentage points from 2006 to 65 primarily as a result of the less mature global signal towers that have lower revenues per tower and higher ground rent expense as a percentage of revenues than our preglobal signal merger towers we believe the global signal towers have significant additional revenue and margin growth opportunities provided by potential future tenant additions on those towers 

general and administrative expenses for 2007 increased by 338 million from 2006 but decreased to 10 of total net revenues from 13 of total net revenues general and administrative expenses are inclusive of stockbased compensation charges as discussed further below the increase in general and administrative expenses in nominal dollars was primarily related to headcount additions and related employee costs as a result of the global signal merger partially offset by cost reductions from the termination of the modeo employees see notes 17 and 19 to our consolidated financial statements the decrease in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues was driven by synergies from operating a larger tower portfolio as a result of the global signal merger 

adjusted ebitda for 2007 increased by 3195 million or 80 from 2006 adjusted ebitda was positively impacted by the same factors that drove the increase of 89 in our site rental revenues including the towers acquired in connection with the global signal merger and tenant additions 

we recognized stockbased compensation expense from continuing operations of 149 million and 235 million respectively for 2006 and 2007 the primary reason for fluctuations in the stockbased compensation expense during 2006 to 2007 is 1 accelerated vesting of awards granted in 2004 and 2005 and 2 our grants in 2006 and 2007 during 2005 restricted stock granted during 2004 and 2005 accelerated vested based on the market performance of our common stock this accelerated vesting resulted in the recognition of 152 million of expense 

  

index to financial statements in 2005 that was originally to be recognized over the original vesting period through 2009 and 2010 in addition during 2006 and 2007 we granted 12 million and 14 million shares respectively of restricted stock with grant date weightedaverage requisite service periods of 25 and 21 years respectively see note 12 to our consolidated financial statements 

in july 2007 we entered into a lease of our spectrum the spectrum is leased to a venture formed by telcom ventures llc and columbia capital llc “cctv” for a 13 million annual lease fee with an initial term from july 23 2007 until october 1 2013 as a result we eliminated substantially all of the future modeo operating and administrative expenses which for 2007 were 40 million in addition for 2007 we recorded 1 site revenues of 57 million from the spectrum lease 2 asset writedown charges of 576 million as a result of the writeoff of substantially all of our modeo assets other than the spectrum and 3 restructuring charges of 31 million related to the termination of the modeo employees see note 17 to our consolidated financial statements 

integration costs for 2007 were 254 million and related to the global signal merger these integration costs included among other things expenses for retention bonus obligations with employees of the former global signal costs for contracted employees directly related to the integration and stockbased compensation charges with respect to restricted stock awards assumed in the global signal merger see “item 7 mda—general overview—acquisition of global signal ” and notes 2 and 19 to our consolidated financial statements 

depreciation amortization and accretion for 2007 increased by 2543 million or 99 from 2006 the vast majority of this increase was related to the depreciation and amortization attributable to property and equipment and intangible assets recorded in connection with the purchase price allocation for the global signal merger our tower assets are recorded at cost estimated replacement cost for those acquired and are depreciated using a useful life that is defined as the period equal to the shorter of 20 years or the term of the underlying ground lease including renewal options see “item 7 mda—accounting and reporting matters—critical accounting policies and estimates” 

interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs for 2007 increased by 1880 million or 118 from 2006 the increase was primarily attributable to additional indebtedness the components of the increase in indebtedness primarily include 1 the issuance of the tower revenue notes 155 billion in november 2006 2 the mortgage loans 18 billion that remained outstanding as obligations after the global signal merger and 3 the issuance of term loans 6500 million during the first half of 2007 this additional indebtedness was offset by our repayment of 10 billion of borrowings under a credit facility using proceeds of the 155 billion tower revenue notes exclusive of the mortgage loans our net increase in debt during 2007 primarily related to 1 funding the gs 550m consideration and 2 purchases of our common stock in 2007 see “item 7 mda—liquidity and capital resources—overview ” 

in 2007 we recorded an impairment charge of 756 million related to a decline in the value of our investment in fibertower that was deemed otherthantemporary future declines in the stock price of fibertower may be determined to be otherthantemporary and result in further writedowns of our investment these potential future writedowns are limited to the carrying value of our investment of 601 million as of december 31 2007 see “item 1a risk factors” and “item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” 

benefit provision for income taxes for 2007 was a benefit of 953 million compared to a provision of 05 million for 2006 we recorded a deferred tax liability of 5566 million as part of the allocation of the purchase price of the global signal merger which was offset in part by the reversal of our federal valuation allowance of 2597 million as a result we 1 are no longer in a net deferred tax asset position 2 are generally no longer recording a valuation allowance on net deferred tax assets because of our historical net operating losses and 3 can generally record the benefit of tax impacts of our results in the statement of operations and comprehensive income loss 

income from discontinued operations of 57 million for 2006 relates primarily to the reversal of liabilities previously established in conjunction with the sale of our former ccuk operations as a result of the termination of related contingencies during 2006 

net income loss for 2007 was a loss of 2279 million an increase from a loss of 408 million for 2006 the increased loss was primarily due to 1 the increases in depreciation amortization and accretion and interest expense all of which were predominantly related to the global signal merger 2 an impairment charge of 756 million related to our investment in fibertower and 3 asset writedown charges 576 million and restructuring 

  

index to financial statements charges 31 million related to modeo totaling 607 million partially offset by 1 the increase in adjusted ebitda as a result of the towers acquired in the global signal merger and growth in our site rental business and 2 our benefit for income taxes 

ccal—2006 and 2007 the increases and decreases between 2006 and 2007 are inclusive of exchange rate fluctuations changes between the two periods were influenced by the average exchange rates from 2006 and 2007 of 07536 and 08387 respectively see “item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” 

total net revenues for 2007 increased by 210 million or 35 from 2006 the increase in total net revenues was due to growth in site rental revenues primarily related to 1 tenant additions on our towers 2 exchange rate fluctuations 3 contractual escalations on existing leases with variable escalations and 4 new towers acquired after the third quarter of 2006 see “item 1 business—the company—ccal” 

adjusted ebitda for 2007 increased by 117 million or 40 from 2006 adjusted ebitda was positively impacted by the same factors that drove the increase in site rental revenues more specifically site rental gross margins increased by 133 million or 37 to 70 of site rental revenues for 2007 from 364 million or 69 of site rental revenues for 2006 the 133 million incremental margin represents 71 of the related increase in site rental revenues 

in may 2007 ccal our 776 majorityowned subsidiary issued a capital return of approximately 1660 million including 372 million to the minority shareholders of ccal the capital return was funded by ccoc through an intercompany borrowing by ccal upon issuance of the capital return we recorded a reduction in additional paidin capital of 89 million as a result of the capital return to the ccal minority shareholders exceeding the carrying value of the minority interests in ccal the intercompany borrowing and related capital return was issued to increase the leverage of the ccal business the losses applicable to the minority interest shareholders will be included in our results in the future as long as their share of the ccal losses exceeds their equity interests 

net income loss for 2007 was income of 51 million an improvement of 62 million from 2006 the change from net loss to net income was primarily driven by the same factors that drove the improvement in adjusted ebitda partially offset by the increase in stockbased compensation charges of 29 million see note 12 to our consolidated financial statements 

ccusa—2005 and 2006 net revenues for 2006 increased by 1062 million or 17 from 2005 of the 1062 million increase in net revenues 944 million or 89 relates to site rental revenues network services revenues for 2006 increased by 118 million from 2005 network services revenues should continue to be somewhat volatile as these revenues unlike site rental revenues are typically not under longterm contract 

the increase in site rental revenue for 2006 was primarily driven by the following that occurred during or after 2005 1 tenant additions 2 the combined 941 towers acquired from trintel and mountain union and 3 an increase in noncash straightline rents primarily relating to the renewal of certain leases 

general and administrative expenses for 2006 decreased by 98 million to 13 of total net revenues from 16 of total net revenues for 2005 general and administrative expenses for 2006 included stockbased compensation expense of 145 million which represents a decrease of 83 million from 2005 stockbased compensation expense decreased from 2005 primarily as a result of accelerated vesting of shares of restricted stock awards during 2005 based on the performance of our stock general and administrative expenses were also reduced as a result of the consolidation of certain management functions in 2005 the decrease in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total net revenues is primarily a function of an increase in revenue without any significant increases in headcount as well as the decrease in stockbased compensation expense 

adjusted ebitda for 2006 increased by 850 million or 27 from 2005 adjusted ebitda was positively impacted by the high incremental margin from tenant additions on existing towers that did not result in significant incremental tower operating costs due to the relatively fixed nature of the costs to operate our towers more specifically site rental gross margins increased by 779 million or 21 to 70 of site rental revenues for 2006 from 3700 million or 67 of site rental revenues for 2005 the 779 million incremental margin represents 83 of the related increase in site rental revenues reflecting the relatively fixed nature of the costs to operate our towers 

  

index to financial statements depreciation amortization and accretion for 2006 increased by 38 million or 2 from 2005 the increase was primarily attributable to the acquisition of the combined 941 trintel and mountain union towers by ccusa and an increase in our tower assets as a result of capital expenditures for both the modification to and maintenance on tower assets see “item 7 mda — liquidity and capital resources—investing activities” for a further discussion of our capital expenditures offset by the effects of our purchase of or extension of ground leases relating to the land on which our towers reside that resulted in increases in the useful life of our towers 

operating income for 2006 increased by 910 million or 304 from 2005 the increase in operating income was primarily driven by 1 the aforementioned 779 million increase in site rental gross margin and 2 the 62 million increase in network services and other gross margin which is a reflection of our customers’ continued demand for our installation services 

losses on the purchases and redemptions of debt for 2006 decreased by 2780 million from 2005 the decrease is primarily related to refinancing activities in 2005 that were completed to reduce our weightedaverage cost of debt and simplify our capital structure for 2005 the loss of 2838 million related to the purchase and redemption of 16 billion of our debt securities repaid with proceeds from the tower revenue notes issued in 2005 

interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs for 2006 increased by 291 million from 2005 the increase is primarily attributable to the approximately 12 billion increase in debt including the borrowings under our credit facility in june 2006 and the tower revenue notes issued november 2006 offset by the refinancing of debt in june 2005 which reduced the weightedaverage coupon on our debt and the repayment of our previously outstanding credit facility entered into in july 2005 see note 7 to our consolidated financial statements 

our financing activities in 2005 and 2006 reflect 1 our focus to decrease our cost of debt and 2 our desire to position ourselves to have the financial flexibility to utilize our internally generated capital for investments which we believe satisfy our investment return criteria including opportunistic share purchases new assets and further investments in our existing assets see “item 7 mda — liquidity and capital resources” for further discussion 

income from discontinued operations of 57 million for 2006 relates primarily to the reversal of liabilities previously established in conjunction with the sale of our former ccuk operations as a result of the termination of related contingencies during 2006 income from discontinued operations for 2005 relates primarily to opencell which was sold on may 9 2005 

the cumulative effect of change in accounting principle for asset retirement obligations in 2005 represents the charge recorded upon adoption of fasb interpretation no 47 “fin 47” accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations—an interpretation of fasb statement no 143  see note 1 to our consolidated financial statements 

net loss for 2006 decreased by 3521 million to 408 million from 3929 million for 2005 the reduction in net loss was primarily driven by a 2780 million decrease in losses on the purchase and redemption of debt 910 million increase in operating income and 291 million increase in interest expense and deferred financing costs as a result of an increase in debt partially reduced by the decrease in our weighted average interest rate 

ccal—2005 and 2006 the increases and decreases between 2005 and 2006 are inclusive of exchange rate fluctuations exchange rates did not have a significant impact on the changes between these two periods see “item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” 

total net revenues for 2006 increased by 53 million or 10 from 2005 this increase is predominately driven by growth in site rental revenues which reflects tenant additions on our towers and escalations on existing leases with variable escalations 

  

index to financial statements adjusted ebitda for 2006 increased by 74 million or 34 from 2005 adjusted ebitda was positively impacted by the incremental margin from the tenant additions on existing towers and contractual escalations on existing leases with variable escalations more specifically site rental gross margins increased by 66 million or 22 to 69 of site rental revenues for 2006 from 298 million or 63 of site rental revenues for 2005 the 66 million incremental margin represents 127 of the related increase in site rental revenues primarily reflecting an improvement in the costs to operate our ccal towers 

operating income loss for 2006 improved by 62 million from 2005 the change from operating loss to operating income is primarily due to the 66 million increase in gross margin from site rental revenues offset slightly by an increase in general and administrative expenses as a result of increased employee related costs including additional stockbased compensation expense as a result of the modification of the ccal option plan to enable employees to require ccal to periodically settle ccal options in cash 

net loss for 2006 improved by 59 million from 2005 the improvement in net loss is primarily driven by the same factors that drove the improvement in operating income loss partially offset by the minority interest shareholder’s 22 portion of the results 

impact of inflation 

other than the towers acquired from global signal the majority of our towers were acquired between 1999 and 2001 tower assets and related depreciation expense do not reflect the impact of inflation occurring subsequent to the acquisition of these towers the impact of inflation on our results of operations for the 2005 2006 and 2007 was not significant 

liquidity and capital resources 

overview 

strategy we seek to invest our available capital among the investment alternatives that we believe exhibit sufficient potential to improve our longterm results of operations on a per share basis we have and we expect to continue to invest in discretionary investments such as 1 opportunistically purchasing our own common stock 2 entering into strategic acquisitions of tower businesses 3 selectively constructing or acquiring towers 4 acquiring the land on which towers are located 5 improving and structurally enhancing our existing towers 6 constructing distributed antenna systems and 7 purchasing or redeeming our debt or preferred stock see “item 1 business” for a further discussion 

our site rental business is generally characterized by a stable cash flow stream generated by revenues under longterm contracts that should be recurring for the foreseeable future over the last five years our cash flows from operations have been sufficient to fund our cash interest payments and sustaining capital expenditures we expect our cash flows from operations over the next 12 months will be sufficient to cover our debt service obligations principal payments and cash interest and our sustaining capital expenditures discussed further below including maintenance activities on our towers we expect to fund the previously mentioned discretionary investments with cash on hand operating cash flows borrowings under our existing revolving credit facility and potential future debt financings in the case of funding acquisitions we also may utilize issuances of our common stock in addition we expect to continue to increase our debt in nominal dollars if we realize anticipated future growth in our operating cash flows in order to maintain debt leverage that we believe is appropriately leveraged to drive longterm shareholder value 

with respect to future debt financings we plan to continue to utilize a combination of bank debt and securitized notes with a similar structure to our existing tower revenue notes and mortgage loans the amount of future debt financing is influenced by such factors as 1 our belief in the potential longterm return of our previously mentioned discretionary investments 2 self imposed limits such as our targeted leverage ratio of generally six to eight times adjusted ebitda and interest coverage ratio of generally two times adjusted ebitda 3 our restrictive debt covenants discussed further below and 4 the availability of financing at attractive rates particularly in light of the current crisis in the credit markets see “item 1a risk factors” and “item 7 mda—liquidity and capital resources—factors affecting sources of liquidity”  

  

index to financial statements 2007 highlights and recent developments during 2007 we took certain actions in furtherance of our strategy of seeking longterm growth in our results of operations on a per share basis including the global signal merger and opportunistic purchases of our common stock these purchases of our common stock and other actions taken to reduce our actual and potential shares of common stock outstanding have a shortterm dilutive impact on our results due to the increased interest expense on the related additional borrowings however we believe these actions will drive longterm shareholder value and better position us to translate potential future growth in our site rental business into growth of our operating results on a per share basis our 2007 significant investing and financing activities are discussed further below and in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 

we completed the global signal merger on january 12 2007 in a stock and cash transaction valued at approximately 40 billion exclusive of the debt that remained outstanding as obligations of global signal we acquired as a result of the global signal merger we issued approximately 981 million shares of common stock and paid the maximum gs 550m consideration the 18 billion of mortgage loans have a structure similar to our tower revenue notes and are securitized by the cash flows of a majority of the global signal towers our decision to fund a portion of the global signal merger in cash was in lieu of our issuing approximately 160 million additional shares of our common stock we utilized cash from the issuance of our tower revenue notes in 2006 to fund the gs 550m consideration see “item 7 mda—general overview—acquisition of global signal” and “item 7 mda—liquidity and capital resources—financing activities” 

during 2007 we purchased 210 million shares of our common stock for approximately 7298 million in cash or an average price of 3468 per share the cash to fund the common stock purchases was predominately from borrowings under our term loans and revolving credit facility consistent with our previously mentioned strategy to allocate capital efficiently we expect to continue to opportunistically purchase our common stock from time to time 

liquidity position as of december 31 2007 after giving effect to our 750 million of borrowings under our revolving credit facility and our purchase of 11 million shares of common stock in january 2008 we had consolidated cash and cash equivalents of 1082 million exclusive of restricted cash of 1706 million consolidated longterm and shortterm debt of 61 billion consolidated redeemable preferred stock of 3138 million and consolidated stockholders equity of 31 billion as of february 19 2008 we also have 1000 million of availability under our revolving credit facility maturing in january 2009 

as of december 31 2007 our outstanding debt has a weightedaverage interest rate of 54 and predominately consists of 53 billion of tower revenue notes and mortgage notes that are securitized by the cash flows from the vast majority of our ccusa towers as well as 6451 million of term loans due in 2014 if our tower revenue notes are not repaid in full by their anticipated repayment dates five years from original issuance then our interest rates substantially increase by at least an additional 5 per annum and monthly principal payments commence we anticipate refinancing the tower revenue notes and mortgage loans with new debt similar to our existing tower revenue notes on or before their repayment dates occurring between december 2009 and november 2011 respectively our mortgage loans have contractual maturities in december 2009 and february 2011 our ability to obtain borrowings that are securitized by tower cash flows and are at commercially reasonable terms will depend on various factors such as our ability to generate cash flows on our existing towers and the state of the capital markets see “item 7 mda—liquidity and capital resources—factors affecting sources of liquidity ” our debt and redeemable preferred stock is discussed further in notes 7 and 10 to our consolidated financial statements 

summary cash flows information 

 

   

index to financial statements operating activities 

the increase in net cash provided by operating activities for 2007 of 746 million from 2006 was due primarily to the cash flow generated by the towers acquired in connection with the global signal merger and the growth in our core site rental business the increase for 2007 was offset by an increase in cash interest paid of 1791 million payments for mergerrelated fees incurred by global signal of approximately 163 million prepayments of longterm easements for land under our towers of 149 million and integration costs related to the global signal merger of 243 million we expect net cash provided by operating activities for 2008 will be greater than 2007 primarily as a result of anticipated growth in our core site rental business changes in working capital and particularly changes in deferred rental revenues prepaid ground leases and accrued interest can have a dramatic impact on our net cash from operating activities for interim periods largely due to the timing of payments 

investing activities 

capital expenditures our capital expenditures can be generally categorized as sustaining or discretionary sustaining capital expenditures include capitalized costs related to 1 maintenance activities on our towers 2 vehicles 3 information technology equipment and 4 office equipment discretionary capital expenditures which we commonly also refer to as “revenue generating capital expenditures” include 1 purchases of land under towers 2 tower improvements in order to support additional site rentals 3 the construction or purchase of towers and 4 the construction of distributed antenna systems in general other than sustaining capital expenditures our decisions regarding capital expenditures are discretionary and are made with respect to activities we believe exhibit sufficient potential to improve our longterm results of operations on a per share basis such decisions are influenced by the availability of capital and expected returns on alternative investments 

a summary of our capital expenditures for 2006 and 2007 is as follows 

 

 total capital expenditures for 2007 increased by 1752 million or 140 from 2006 predominately related to ccusa the increase in sustaining capital expenditures from 2006 to 2007 was primarily related to the towers acquired in connection with the global signal merger the increase in land purchases related to our ongoing efforts to purchase the land under our towers during 2006 and 2007 we built or purchased 13 and 188 towers respectively exclusive of the global signal merger and the acquisition of mountain union see also “item 7 mda—results of operations—comparison of operating segment” for a discussion regarding modeo 

consistent with our plan to continue to invest our available cash on hand anticipated cash flows from operations and cash flows from borrowings in discretionary investments we expect total capital expenditures for 2008 will be equal to or modestly greater than 2007 primarily as a result of anticipated increases in purchases of land under towers and new tower construction the amount of capital expenditures related to purchases of towers can vary from period to period as such an increase in tower purchases may further increase our 2008 capital expenditures we expect that most if not all of our capital expenditures for 2008 will be funded from cash flows from operations 

acquisition of global signal see “item 7 mda—general overview—acquisition of global signal” and “item 7 mda—liquidity and capital resources—overview” 

mountain union on january 2 2007 we purchased the remaining approximately 2 minority interest in mountain union for 44 million see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements 

  

index to financial statements financing activities 

consistent with our strategy to allocate our capital to drive shareholder value our financing activities for 2006 and 2007 are largely related to purchases of our common stock and additional borrowings the additional borrowings were used to 1 fund our purchases of common stock 2 fund the gs 550m consideration of the global signal merger and 3 refinance our debt at attractive rates the net cash provided by used for financing activities in 2007 is exclusive of the approximately 18 billion of debt that remained outstanding as obligations after the global signal merger consisting of two mortgage loans see note 7 to our consolidated financial statements the following is a summary of the significant financing transactions we completed in 2007 and the beginning of 2008 

2007 credit agreement in january 2007 ccoc entered into a credit agreement that provided a 2500 million senior secured revolving credit facility in january 2008 we extended the maturity of the revolving credit facility until january 2009 this oneyear extension did not result in any other changes to the revolving credit facility including to our credit spreads we currently have 1500 million outstanding under the revolving credit facility availability of the revolving credit facility at any time will be determined by certain financial ratios we may use the availability under the revolving credit facility for general corporate purposes which may include financing of capital expenditures acquisitions and purchases of our common or preferred stock the revolving credit facility bears interest at prime rate or libor plus a credit spread based on our consolidated leverage ratio as of february 19 2008 the revolving credit facility bears interest at 60 including the credit spread 

in january and march 2007 ccoc entered into two term loans for an aggregate original principal amount of 6500 million which were issued under the credit agreement and are due in 2014 our purchases of 210 million shares of our common stock during 2007 were primarily funded with proceeds from the term loans and borrowings under our revolving credit facility through the use of interest rate swaps we have fixed the interest rate on the vast majority of the term loans at a rate of 56 including the credit spread through december 31 2009 

the revolving credit facility and the term loans are guaranteed by ccic and certain of its existing and future subsidiaries and secured by a pledge of certain equity interests of certain existing and future subsidiaries of ccic as well as a security interest in ccoc’s deposit accounts and securities accounts for a further discussion of the revolving credit facility and the term loans see note 7 to our consolidated financial statements and “item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” 

common stock activity a summary of common stock activity for the years ended december 31 2006 and 2007 is as follows 

 

 during 2006 and 2007 we purchased 159 million and 210 million shares of our common stock respectively we utilized 5180 million and 7298 million in cash respectively to affect these purchases and paid an average price per share of 3264 and 3468 respectively see note 11 to our consolidated financial statements see “item 7 mda—general overview—acquisition of global signal” for a discussion of common stock issued in the global signal merger in addition in january 2008 we purchased 11 million shares of common stock utilizing 420 million average price of 3699 per share in cash 

  

index to financial statements ccal capital return see “item 7 mda—results of operations—comparison of operating segments” for a discussion of the minority interest and ccal capital return 

preferred stock dividends we have the option to pay dividends on our 625 convertible preferred stock in cash or shares of common stock valued at 95 of the current market value of the common stock as defined see “item 5 market for registrant’s common equity related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities”  we are required to redeem all outstanding shares of our 625 convertible preferred stock on august 15 2012 at a price equal to the liquidation preference plus accumulated and unpaid dividends the shares of 625 convertible preferred stock are convertible at the option of the holder in whole or in part at any time into shares of common stock at a conversion price of 36875 per share of common stock under certain circumstances we generally have the right to convert the 625 convertible preferred stock in whole or in part into 86 million shares of common stock at 120 of the conversion price or 4425 

interest rate swaps we have used and may continue to use when we deem prudent interest rate swaps to manage and reduce our interest rate risk including the use of interest rate swaps to hedge the variability in cash flows from changes in libor on anticipated refinancing and outstanding variable rate debt see “item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” and note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of our use of interest rate swaps 

restricted cash pursuant to the indenture governing the tower revenue notes and the loan agreements governing the mortgage loans all rental cash receipts of the issuers of these debt investments and their subsidiaries are restricted and held by an indenture trustee the restricted cash in excess of required reserve balances is subsequently released to us in accordance with the terms of the indentures see also notes 1 and 7 to our consolidated financial statements 

contractual cash obligations 

the following table summarizes our contractual cash obligations which relate primarily to our outstanding borrowings and ground lease obligations as of december 31 2007 after giving effect to our borrowings of 750 million in january 2008 under our revolving credit facility and the extension of the maturity to january 2009 from january 2008

 the following table summarizes as of december 31 2007 the remaining terms to expiration including renewal terms at our option of 1 the ground leases subleases or licenses for the land on which approximately 18400 of our towers reside and 2 agreements to manage approximately 700 towers owned by third parties where we had sublease agreements with the tower owner in addition we own in fee or have perpetual or longterm easements in the land on which approximately 4700 of our towers reside 20 of total towers see “ item 1a risk factors ” 

 

 factors affecting sources of liquidity 

holding companies as holding companies ccic and ccoc will require distributions or dividends from their subsidiaries or will be forced to use their remaining cash balances to fund their debt the terms of the current indebtedness of their subsidiaries allow them to distribute cash to their holding companies unless they experience a deterioration of financial performance 

compliance with debt covenants our debt obligations contain certain financial covenants with which ccic or our subsidiaries must maintain compliance in order to avoid the imposition of certain restrictions various of our debt obligations also place other restrictions on ccic or our subsidiaries including the ability to incur debt and liens purchase our securities make capital expenditures dispose of assets undertake transactions with affiliates make other investments and pay dividends see note 7 of our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of debt covenants 

factors that are likely to determine our subsidiaries’ ability to comply with their current and future debt covenants include their 1 financial performance 2 levels of indebtedness and 3 debt service requirements given the current level of indebtedness of our subsidiaries the primary risk of a debt covenant violation would be from a deterioration of a subsidiary’s financial performance should a covenant violation occur in the future as a result of a shortfall in financial performance or for any other reason we might be required to make principal payments earlier than currently scheduled and may not have access to additional borrowings under these facilities as long as the covenant violation continues any such early principal payments would have to be made from our existing cash balances or cash from operations if our subsidiaries that issued the tower revenue notes and mortgage loans were to default on the debt the trustee could seek to foreclose upon or otherwise convert the ownership of the securitized towers in which case we could lose the towers and the revenues associated with the towers based upon our current expectations we believe our operating results will be sufficient to comply with our debt covenants 

financial performance of our subsidiaries a factor affecting our continued generation of cash flows from operating activities is our ability to maintain our existing recurring site rental revenues and to convert those revenues into operating cash flows by efficiently managing our operating costs our ability to service pay principal and cash interest or refinance our current debt obligations and obtain additional debt will depend on our future financial performance which to a certain extent is subject to various factors that are beyond our control as discussed further herein and in “item 1a risk factors” 

levels of indebtedness and debt service requirements our ability to obtain cash financing in the form of debt instruments preferred stock or common stock in the capital markets depends on among other things general economic conditions conditions of the wireless industry wireless carrier consolidation or network sharing new technologies our financial performance and the state of the capital markets we anticipate refinancing the majority if not all of our debt and preferred stock within the next five years there can be no assurances we will be able to effect this anticipated financing on commercially reasonable terms or on terms including with respect to interest 

  

index to financial statements rates as favorable as our current debt and preferred stock if we are unable to refinance or renegotiate our debt our debt service requirements may significantly increase in the future 

the current credit crisis has resulted in a widening of credit spreads for us however there has recently been a general decrease in interest rates such as libor corresponding with the challenges of the credit market currently the negative impact of widening credit spreads has been somewhat mitigated by a general decrease in interest rates by the end of 2011 we expect to refinance our outstanding indebtedness and have entered into interest rate swaps to manage and reduce our interest rate risk on this anticipated refinancing changes in our credit spreads over the intermediate to longterm may impact our interest expense and interest coverage ratios

see also notes 11 and 14 to our consolidated financial statements 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the following is a discussion of the accounting policies and estimates that we believe 1 are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and 2 require our most difficult subjective or complex judgments often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain the critical accounting policies and estimates for 2007 is not intended to be a comprehensive list of our accounting policies and estimates see note 1 to our consolidated financial statements for a summary of our significant accounting policies in many cases the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by accounting principles generally accepted in the us with no need for management’s judgment in their application in other cases management is required to exercise judgment in the application of accounting principles with respect to particular transactions 

revenue recognition site rental revenues are recognized on a monthly basis over the fixed noncancelable term of the relevant lease or agreement with terms generally ranging from five to ten years in accordance with applicable accounting standards these revenues are recognized on a monthly basis regardless of whether the payments from the customer are received in equal monthly amounts if the payment terms call for fixed escalations as in fixed dollar or fixed percentage increases the effect of such increases is recognized on a straightline basis over the fixed noncancelable term of the agreement when calculating our straightline rental revenues we consider all fixed elements of tenant leases escalation provisions even if such escalation provisions also include a variable element as a result of recognizing revenue on a straightline basis a portion of the revenue in a given period represents cash collected in other periods for 2005 2006 and 2007 the noncash portion of our site rental revenues related to recognizing revenue on a straightline basis amounted to approximately 161 million 205 million and 429 million respectively see note 1 to our consolidated financial statements 

we provide network services such as antenna installations and subsequent augmentation network design and site selection site acquisition services site development and other services on a limited basis network services revenues are generally recognized under a method which approximates the completed contract method under the completed contract method revenues and costs for a particular project are recognized in total at the completion date when using the completed contract method of accounting for network services revenues we must accurately determine the completion date for the project in order to record the revenues and costs in the proper period for antenna installations we consider the project complete when the customer can begin transmitting its signal through the antenna we must also be able to estimate losses on uncompleted contracts as such losses must be recognized as soon as they are known the completed contract method is used for projects that require relatively short periods of time to complete generally less than one year such as our network services agreements and contracts we do 

  

index to financial statements not believe that our use of the completed contract method for network services projects produces financial position and operating results that differ substantially from the percentageofcompletion method 

some of our arrangements with our customers call for the performance of multiple revenuegenerating activities generally these arrangements include both site rental and network services in such cases we determine whether the multiple deliverables are to be accounted for separately or on a combined basis in order to be accounted for separately the undelivered items must 1 have standalone value to the customer 2 have reliably determinable fair value on a separate basis and 3 have delivery which is probable and under our control in addition the delivered item must have standalone value to the customer allocation of recognized revenue in such arrangements is based on the relative fair value of the separately delivered items we have generally determined that it is appropriate to account for antenna installation activities separately from the customer’s subsequent site rentals 

accounting for longlived assets we allocate the purchase price of acquisitions to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair value at the date of acquisition any purchase price in excess of the net fair value of the assets and liabilities assumed is allocated to goodwill the fair value of certain of our assets and liabilities is determined by 1 using estimates of replacement costs for tangible fixed assets such as towers and 2 using discounted cash flow valuation methods for estimating identifiable intangibles such as site rental contracts and above and below market leases the purchase price allocation requires subjective estimates that if incorrectly estimated could be material to our consolidated financials statements including the amount of depreciation amortization and accretion expense the determination of the final purchase price allocation could extend over several quarters resulting in the use of preliminary estimates that are subject to adjustment until finalized 

we are required to make subjective assessments as to the useful lives of our tangible and intangible assets for purposes of determining depreciation amortization and accretion expense that if incorrectly estimated could be material to our consolidated financial statements depreciation expense for our property and equipment is computed using the straightline method over the estimated useful lives of our various classes of tangible assets the substantial portion of our property and equipment represents the cost of our towers which is depreciated with an estimated useful life equal to the shorter of 20 years or the term of the lease including optional renewals for the land under the tower the useful life of our intangible assets are estimated based on the period for which the intangible asset will benefit us 

we review the carrying values of property and equipment intangible assets and other longlived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable if the sum of the estimated future cash flows undiscounted from the asset is less than its carrying amount an impairment loss is recognized measurement of an impairment loss is based on the fair value of the asset our determination that an adverse event or change in circumstance has occurred will generally involve 1 a deterioration in an asset’s financial performance compared to historical results 2 a shortfall in an asset’s financial performance compared to forecasted results or 3 a change in strategy affecting the utility of the asset our measurement of the fair value of an impaired asset will generally be based on an estimate of discounted future cash flows 

we test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis regardless of whether adverse events or changes in circumstances have occurred this annual impairment test involves 1 a step to identify potential impairment at a reporting unit level based on fair values and 2 a step to measure the amount of the impairment if any our measurement of the fair value for goodwill is based on an estimate of discounted future cash flows of the reporting unit the most important estimates for such calculations are the expected additions of new tenants on our towers the terminal multiple for our projected cash flows and our weightedaverage cost of capital 

during the fourth quarter of 2007 we performed our annual update of the impairment test for goodwill the results of this test indicated that goodwill was not impaired at any of our reporting units future declines in our site rental business could result in an impairment of goodwill property and equipment and intangible assets in the future if impairment were to occur in the future the calculations to measure the impairment could result in the writeoff of some portion to substantially all of our goodwill property and equipment and intangible assets 

deferred income taxes we record deferred income tax assets and liabilities on our balance sheet related to events that impact our financial statements and tax returns in different periods in order to compute these deferred tax balances we first analyze the differences between the book basis and tax basis of our assets and liabilities referred to as “temporary differences” these temporary differences are then multiplied by current tax rates to 

  

index to financial statements arrive at the balances for the deferred income tax assets and liabilities a valuation allowance is provided on deferred tax assets if it is determined that it is more likely than not that the asset will not be realized 

the change in our net deferred income tax balances during a period generally results in a deferred income tax provision or benefit in our consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income loss if our expectations about the future tax consequences of past events should prove to be inaccurate the balances of our deferred income tax assets and liabilities could require significant adjustments in future periods such adjustments could cause a material effect on our results of operations for the period of the adjustment see note 8 to our consolidated financial statements 

impact of recently issued accounting standards 

in july 2006 the fasb issued interpretation no 48 “fin 48” accounting for uncertainty in income taxes—an interpretation of fasb statement no 109  which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in tax positions we adopted fin 48 on january 1 2007 the adoption of fin 48 resulted in a decrease in accumulated deficit and a decrease in contingent tax liabilities through a cumulative effect adjustment of 47 million see note 8 of our consolidated financial statements 

in september 2006 the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 157 “sfas 157” fair value measurements  which defines fair value establishes a framework for measuring fair value in gaap and expands disclosures about fair value measurements the fasb amended sfas 157 to exclude leases accounted for pursuant to sfas 13 sfas 157 will be applied prospectively and is effective for us on january 1 2008 with the exception of a oneyear deferral of implementation for certain nonfinancial assets and liabilities we believe the impact of the adoption of sfas 157 will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

in december 2007 the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 160 “sfas 160” “ noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements—an amendment to accounting research bulletin no 51 ” sfas 160 amends accounting research bulletin no 51 to establish accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary sfas 160 clarifies that a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary is an ownership interest in the consolidated entity that should be reported as equity in the consolidated financial statements sfas 160 requires consolidated net income to be reported at amounts that include the amounts attributable to both the parent and the noncontrolling interest the provisions of sfas 160 are effective for us as of january 1 2009 we are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of sfas 160 on our consolidated financial statements 

in december 2007 the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 141r “sfas 141r” business combinations revised 2007 sfas 141r replaces statement of financial accounting standards no 141 “sfas 141” business combinations  sfas 141r establishes principles and requirements for recognizing and measuring identifiable assets and goodwill acquired liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in an acquisition at their fair value as of the acquisition date sfas 141r will change the accounting treatment of certain items including 1 acquisition and restructuring costs will be generally expensed as incurred 2 noncontrolling interests will be valued at fair value at the acquisition date 3 acquired contingent liabilities will be recorded at fair value at the acquisition date and subsequently measured at either the higher of such amount or the amount determined under existing guidance for nonacquired contingencies and 4 changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances and income tax uncertainties after the acquisition date will affect provision for income taxes the provisions of sfas 141r are applied prospectively to our business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after january 1 2009 we are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of sfas 141r on our consolidated financial statements

our measurement of profit or loss currently used to evaluate the operating performance of our operating segments is earnings before interest taxes depreciation amortization and accretion as adjusted or adjusted ebitda our definition of adjusted ebitda is set forth in “ item 7 mda—results of operations—comparison of operating segments ” our measure of adjusted ebitda may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies including companies in the tower sector and as used in the historical financial statements of global 

  

index to financial statements signal and is not a measure of performance calculated in accordance with gaap adjusted ebitda should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for operating income or loss net income or loss cash flows provided by used for operating investing and financing activities or other income statement or cash flow statement data prepared in accordance with gaap 

we believe adjusted ebitda is useful to an investor in evaluating our operating performance because 

 

  

  

  

  

 our management uses adjusted ebitda 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 there are material limitations to using a measure such as adjusted ebitda including the difficulty associated with comparing results among more than one company and the inability to analyze certain significant items including depreciation and interest expense that directly affect our net income or loss management compensates for these limitations by considering the economic effect of the excluded expense items independently as well as in connection with their analysis of net income loss

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend our primary exposures to market risks are related to changes in interest rates equity security prices and foreign currency exchange rates which may adversely affect our results of operations and financial position we seek to manage exposure to changes in interest rates where economically prudent to do so by utilizing predominately fixed rate debt and interest rate swaps we do not currently hedge against foreign currency exchange risks or attempt to reduce our equity security price risk on our investment in fibertower 

interest rate risk 

certain of the financial instruments we have used to obtain capital are subject to market risks for fluctuations in market interest rates as of february 19 2008 we had 7951 million approximately 13 of total debt of floating rate indebtedness of which 6250 million is effectively locked through an interest rate swap at a fixed rate until december 2009 as a result a hypothetical unfavorable fluctuation in market interest rates of one percentage point over a twelvemonth period would increase our interest expense by approximately 17 million after giving affect to our interest rate swaps in addition we anticipate refinancing the majority if not all of our debt within the next five years 

we have used and may continue to use when we deem prudent interest rate swaps to manage and reduce our interest rate risk including the use of interest rate swaps to hedge the variability in cash flows from changes in libor on anticipated refinancing and outstanding variable rate debt we do not enter into interest rate swaps for speculative or trading purposes our interest rate swaps call for us to pay interest at a fixed rate in exchange for receiving interest at a variable rate equal to libor we have hedged our exposure to variability in libor on the expected future refinancing of our tower revenue notes and mortgage loans through the use of forward starting interest rate swaps with maturity dates between december 2014 and november 2016 additional interest rate swaps have effectively locked in the interest rate on 6250 million of our term loans issued in 2007 at a fixed rate until december 2009 the interest rate swaps are exclusive of any credit spread that would be incremental to the interest rate of the anticipated financing see the tables below 

our outstanding debt as of december 31 2006 and 2007 was 35 billion and 61 billion respectively the combined notional amount of outstanding interest rate swaps as of december 31 2006 and 2007 was 35 billion and 59 billion respectively the increase in outstanding debt and the combined notional value of our outstanding interest rate swaps is primarily related to the 18 billion mortgage loans that remained outstanding following the global signal merger and forward starting interest rate swaps to hedge our exposure to libor on the forecasted refinancing of the mortgage loans 

during 2005 and 2006 we terminated certain interest rate swaps relating to the tower revenue notes issued in 2005 and 2006 respectively the effective interest rate on the tower revenue notes issued in 2005 and 2006 is approximately 495 and 583 respectively inclusive of an increase of approximately 006 and 012 respectively in the effective interest rate relating to interest rate swaps and exclusive of deferred financing costs see note 7 to our consolidated financial statements 

  

index to financial statements the following tables provide information about our market risk related to changes in interest rates the expected principal payments weightedaverage interest rates and the interest rate swaps are presented as of december 31 2007 after giving effect to our 750 million of borrowings during january 2008 under our revolving credit facility and extension of the maturity to january 2009 from january 2008 

 

  

  

       

  

      

index to financial statements equity security price risk 

we are exposed to price fluctuations on our availableforsale investment in fibertower equity securities we do not currently attempt to reduce or eliminate the market exposure on these securities for the year ended december 31 2007 we recorded a charge of 756 million to writedown the value of our investment in fibertower relating to a decline in value deemed otherthantemporary our potential future writedowns are limited to the carrying value of our investment of 601 million as of december 31 2007 as of february 19 2008 the fair value of our investment in fibertower was 414 million at 157 per fibertower share as of december 31 2007 a 50 hypothetical adverse change in the fibertower equity price would result in an approximately 300 million decrease in the fair value of our availableforsale equity investments the offsetting adjustment resulting from the hypothetical future decrease in fair value would be to “accumulated other comprehensive income” or if determined to be an otherthantemporary decline to “impairment of availableforsale securities” on our consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income loss see note 6 to our consolidated financial statements and “item 1a risk factors” 

foreign currency risk 

our business activities in australia canada and the uk expose us to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates the vast majority of our foreign currency transactions are denominated in the australian dollar which is the functional currency of ccal as a result of ccal’s transactions being denominated and settled in such functional currencies the risks associated with currency fluctuations are primarily associated with foreign currency translation adjustments we do not currently hedge against foreign currency translation risks we do not currently believe our financial instruments denominated in foreign currencies expose us to material foreign currency exchange risk based on the estimated impact of a hypothetical 15 unfavorable change in currency exchange rates as of december 31 2007 the company had approximately 240 million in cash and cash equivalents denominated in australian dollars

 item 1 business 

overview 

we own operate and lease towers and other communication structures including certain rooftop installations collectively “towers” for wireless communications see “item 2 properties”  we engage in such activities through a variety of structures including subleasing and management arrangements we also provide certain network services relating to our towers on a limited basis for our customers including antenna installations and subsequent augmentation network design and site selection site acquisition site development and other services 

as of december 31 2006 after giving effect to the merger “global signal merger” of global signal into a whollyowned subsidiary of ours in january 2007 “postmerger” we owned leased or managed 23661 towers see “item 1 business—global signal merger”  postmerger we have the most towers in the united states “us” of any wireless tower company with approximately 21700 towers exclusive of rooftop installations in addition we have 1387 towers in australia and the remainder of our towers are located in puerto rico and canada as of december 31 2006 postmerger we also owned leased or had easements on 280 land sites for towers owned by third parties which are located in the us and the united kingdom “uk” our customers currently include many of the world’s major wireless communications companies including sprint nextel corp “sprint nextel” att formerly cingular wireless verizon wireless tmobile alltel singtel optus “optus” and vodafone australia 

as of december 31 2006 postmerger we own in fee or have permanent or longterm easements in the land and other properties collectively “land” on which 3930 of our towers reside and we lease sublease or license the land on which 18994 of our towers reside in addition as of december 31 2006 postmerger we managed 737 towers owned by third parties where we had the right to market space on the tower or where we had sublease arrangements with the tower owner 

our core business is the leasing including via licensing of antenna space on our towers that can accommodate multiple tenants “colocation” our site rental leasing revenues are derived from this core business typically these revenues result from longterm five to 10 year contracts with our customers with renewal terms at the option of the customer as a result in any given year in excess of 90 of our site rental revenue excluding acquisitions has been contracted for in a prior year 

our tower portfolio consists primarily of towers in various metropolitan areas as of december 31 2006 postmerger approximately 55 of our us and puerto rico towers were located in the 50 largest basic trading areas or “btas” in the us and puerto rico and approximately 72 of such towers were located in the 100 largest btas see “ item 1 business—the company—ccusa ” through our australia tower portfolio we have a strategic presence in each of australia’s major metropolitan areas including sydney melbourne brisbane adelaide and perth see “ item 1 business—the company—ccal ” 

we believe our towers are attractive to a diverse range of wireless communications industries including cellular personal communications services “pcs” enhanced specialized mobile radio “esmr” third generation “3g” wireless data paging fixed pointtopoint radio and point to multipoint broadcasting such as radio and television broadcasting in the us our major customers include sprint nextel att formerly cingular wireless verizon wireless tmobile and alltel our principal customers in australia are optus vodafone australia hutchison and telstra 

  

in addition to our tower portfolios we also have invested in adjacent businesses that we believe exhibit sufficient potential to achieve acceptable riskadjusted returns or complement our core tower rental business as evidenced by our investments in modeo and fibertower nasdaq ftwr 

strategy 

our strategy is to increase our recurring revenue and cash flow by leasing space on our towers to wireless companies and where appropriate to continue to build acquire and operate towers and wireless infrastructure through opportunities created by 

 

  

  

  

  

 we believe our strategy is consistent with our mission to deliver the highest level of service to our customers at all times – striving to be their critical partner as we assist them in growing efficient ubiquitous wireless networks the key elements of our strategy which leverages our experience in expanding marketing and operating our portfolio of towers are to 

 

  

  

   

 2006 highlights and recent developments 

during 2006 we engaged in a number of significant activities consistent with our strategy including entering into a definitive agreement to acquire global signal the purchase of shares of our common stock “common stock” the refinancing and issuance of indebtedness and the acquisition of mountain union telecom llc “mountain union” the global signal merger is discussed below under “item 1 business—global signal merger” see “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—general overview—overview” for a summary description of the highlights of such other activities occurring in 2006 and the beginning of 2007 

global signal merger 

on october 5 2006 we entered into a definitive agreement “merger agreement” which contemplated the merger of global signal into a whollyowned subsidiary of ours global signal operated 10749 towers primarily concentrated in the southwestern midwestern pacific coast and northeastern regions of the us pursuant to the merger agreement on january 12 2007 global signal was merged with and into a whollyowned subsidiary of ours in a stock and cash transaction valued at approximately 40 billion exclusive of debt of approximately 18 billion that remained outstanding as obligations of the global signal entities acquired as a result of the completion of global signal merger we issued approximately 981 million shares of common stock and paid the maximum 5500 million in cash “cash consideration” to the stockholders of global signal and reserved for issuance approximately 06 million shares of common stock issuable pursuant to global signal warrants pursuant to the merger agreement global signal common stockholders were entitled to convert each share of global signal common stock into 161 shares of our common stock or alternatively could elect to receive cash in the amount of 5595 per global signal share following the global signal merger the former global signal stockholders owned approximately 327 of our outstanding shares see “ item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—general overview—current year highlights and recent developments ” “ item 1a risk factors ” and “item 1 business—the company—ccusa” 

upon closing of the global signal merger global signal’s subsidiaries had debt outstanding of approximately 18 billion all of which remained outstanding as obligations of the global signal entities we acquired having a structure similar to the 19 billion in notes issued through certain of our subsidiaries in june 2005 “2005 tower revenue notes” and the 155 billion in notes issued through certain of our subsidiaries in november 2006 “2006 tower revenue notes” as a result we have significantly increased our interest expense see “ item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—liquidity and capital resources—financing activities ” 

global signal revenues cost of operations and gross margins for 2006 were approximately 500 million unaudited 225 million unaudited and 275 million unaudited respectively we entered into the global signal merger primarily because of the growth opportunities we anticipate the global signal tower portfolio will provide including through the leveraging of our management team and customer service across an enhanced national footprint we believe the anticipated opportunities for growth will be driven by the carrier focus on improving network quality subscriber growth increasing subscriber usage wireline replacement and next generation network builds see “ item 7 management’s 

  

discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationsgeneral overviewoverview” secondarily we believe there will be synergistic opportunities provided by the global signal merger in 2007 as a result of the global signal merger we do expect a substantial increase in our general and administrative expenses from 2006 but we also anticipate a decrease in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue we also expect to incur a substantial amount of costs to integrate global signal into our internal control structure and operations 

stockholders agreement concurrently with the execution of the merger agreement we entered into a stockholders agreement “stockholders agreement” with 1 certain investment funds affiliated with fortress investment group llc collectively “fortress” 2 greenhill capital partners lp and certain of its related partnerships collectively “greenhill” and 3 abrams capital partners ii lp and certain of its related partnerships collectively “abrams capital” and together with fortress and greenhill the “global signal significant stockholders” pursuant to the stockholders agreement we have filed an automatic shelf registration statement with the sec registering certain shares of our common stock received by the global signal significant stockholders in the merger “merger shares” in addition pursuant to the stockholders agreement the global signal significant stockholders and certain of their affiliates 1 have a limited number of demands for us to register their merger shares and 2 will be able to have their respective merger shares registered whenever we propose to register our equity securities 

in lieu of global signal significant stockholders’ right to require us to conduct a marketed secondary offering of certain of their merger shares within 90 days after the merger on january 19 2007 we entered into a stock purchase agreement with the global signal significant stockholders pursuant to which we purchased an aggregate of 177 million shares of our common stock from the global signal significant stockholders “january 2007 stock purchase” see “item 1 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—general overview—current year highlights and recent developments” 

as required by the stockholders agreement we have appointed a representative of each of the global signal significant stockholders to our board of directors “board of directors” wesley r edens robert h niehaus and david c abrams were appointed to the board of directors as representatives of fortress greenhill and abrams capital respectively each global signal stockholder has a onetime right to renominate its designated director or another individual reasonably acceptable to us if such global signal stockholder owns more than 30 of the outstanding shares of our common stock at the time of such renomination 

the company 

we operate our business primarily in the us including puerto rico and australia with limited additional operations in canada and the u k we conduct our operations principally through subsidiaries of crown castle operating company “ccoc” including 1 certain subsidiaries which operate our tower portfolios in the us puerto rico and canada referred to as “ccusa” and 2 a joint venture in which we have a 776 interest that operates our australia tower portfolio referred to as “ccal” for more information about our operating segments as well as financial information about the geographic areas in which we operate see note 16 to our consolidated financial statements and the section entitled “ item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ” below 

ccusa 

overview 

the primary business of ccusa is the leasing of antenna space on multipletenant towers to a variety of customers under longterm leases supporting our competitive position in the site rental business we offer our customers certain network services relating to our towers including antenna installations and other services 

at december 31 2006 postmerger ccusa owned leased or managed 22274 towers including rooftop installations although we own lease or manage 252 towers located in puerto rico and canada that are included in ccusa our towers are primarily located throughout the us the us towers are located predominantly in the northeast southeast midwest southwest and pacific coast regions of the us most of our towers were acquired through 

  

transactions consummated within the past eight years including through transactions with global signal bell atlantic mobile and gte wireless both now part of verizon wireless bellsouth mobility and bellsouth dcs both now part of att formerly cingular wireless and powertel now a part of tmobile 

through the global signal merger which closed on january 12 2007 we acquired 10749 towers which are located primarily in the us of the 10749 towers global signal operated and which we now operate 6553 towers “sprint towers” are to be leased or operated for a period of 32 years through may 2037 under master leases and subleases “sprint master leases” with sprint corporation a predecessor of sprint nextel and certain subsidiaries of sprint corporation entered into in may 2005 global signal prepaid the rent owed under the sprint master leases in may 2005 during the period commencing one year prior to the expiration of the sprint master leases and ending 120 days prior to expiration postmerger we have the option to purchase all but not less than all of the sprint towers then leased for approximately 23 billion postmerger we are entitled to all revenue from the sprint towers during the term of the sprint master leases including amounts payable under existing leases with third parties in addition under the sprint master leases certain sprint corporation subsidiaries have agreed to sublease space on substantially all of the sprint towers for an initial period of 10 years at the closing of the global signal merger the sprint master leases remained effective as an asset and commitment of the global signal entities we acquired 

prior to the global signal merger our communication towers were primarily acquired in transactions beginning in 1998 through 2000 including the following transactions 

 

    we plan to continue to structurally enhance our existing towers and selectively build or acquire strategically located towers which meet certain economic criteria on a limited basis to reduce risk and speculation in connection with building towers we generally look for towers with multiple tenant demand and obtain lease commitments from customers prior to building such towers further the towers are constructed to accommodate multiple tenants in order to obviate the need for later structural enhancement saving capital and time for our customers 

site rental 

ccusa rents antenna space on its towers to a variety of carriers operating cellular pcs esmr 3g wireless data services paging and other networks the number of antennae that our towers can accommodate varies depending on the tower’s location height and structural capacity 

we generally receive monthly rental payments from customers payable under site leases the new leases at ccusa recently entered into by us typically have original terms of seven to 10 years with three or four optional renewal periods of five years each and provide for annual price increases based upon a consumer price index a fixed percentage or a combination thereof the lease agreements with our customers relating to tower network acquisitions generally have an original term of 10 years with multiple renewal options each typically ranging from five to 10 years we have existing master lease agreements with most major wireless carriers including sprint nextel 

  

att formerly cingular wireless verizon wireless and tmobile which provide certain terms including economic terms that govern leases on our towers entered into by such parties during the term of their master lease agreements 

the average monthly rental payment of a new tenant added to a tower varies among the different regions in the us and the type of service being provided by the tenant with broadband tenants such as pcs paying more than narrowband tenants such as paging primarily as a result of the physical size of the antenna installation in addition we also routinely receive rental payment increases in connection with lease amendments which authorize carriers to add additional antennas or other equipment to towers on which they already have equipment pursuant to preexisting lease agreements 

network services 

we also provide network services on a limited basis primarily relating to our towers for our customers our service offering consists of antenna installations and subsequent augmentation network design and site selection site acquisition site development and other services 

customers 

in both the ccusa site rental and network services businesses we work with a number of customers in a variety of businesses including cellular pcs esmr 3g wireless data services and paging we work extensively with large national wireless carriers such as sprint nextel att formerly cingular wireless verizon wireless and tmobile for the year ended december 31 2006 these four carriers accounted for approximately 727 of ccusa’s revenues and 672 of our consolidated revenues with sprint nextel att formerly cingular wireless verizon wireless and tmobile accounting for 160 254 220 and 93 respectively of ccusa’s revenues and 148 235 203 and 86 respectively of our consolidated revenues for the year ended december 31 2006 on a pro forma basis as if the global signal merger was completed january 1 2006 approximately 683 of our total combined revenues was derived from sprint nextel att formerly cingular wireless verizon wireless and tmobile with such customers representing 242 204 153 and 84 of our combined consolidated revenues respectively no other single customer of ccusa accounted for more than 100 of our 2006 consolidated revenues see “ item 1a risk factors—a substantial portion of our revenues is derived from a small number of customers ” 

sales and marketing 

the ccusa sales organization markets our towers within the wireless telecommunications industry we seek to become the preferred independent tower provider for our customers we use public and proprietary databases to develop targeted marketing programs focused on carrier network buildouts modifications site additions and network services information about carriers’ existing location of antenna space leases marketing strategies capital spend plans deployment status and actual wireless carrier signal strength measurements taken in the field is analyzed to match specific towers in our portfolios with potential new site demand in addition we have developed patented property management tools and software which allow us to estimate site leasing demand with greater speed and accuracy through these and other tools we have developed we seek to determine “potential demand” for our towers allowing for proactive discussions with our carrier customers regarding these towers and the timing of their demand 

a team of national account directors maintains our relationships with our largest customers these directors work to develop new tower leasing opportunities network services contracts and site management opportunities as well as to ensure that customers’ tower needs are efficiently translated into new leases on our towers 

sales personnel in our area offices develop and maintain local relationships with carriers that are expanding their networks entering new markets bringing new technologies to market or requiring maintenance or addon business we target numerous types of customers including cellular pcs esmr 3g wireless data paging and government agencies our objective is to lease space on existing towers and presell capacity on our new towers prior to construction 

  

in addition to our fulltime sales and marketing staff a number of senior managers and officers spend a significant portion of their time on sales and marketing activities and call on existing and prospective customers 

competition 

ccusa competes with other independent tower owners which also provide site rental and network services wireless carriers which build own and operate their own tower networks broadcasters with respect to their broadcast towers building owners that lease antenna space on rooftop sites and other potential competitors such as utilities and outdoor advertisers some of which actively participate in the site rental industry wireless carriers that own and operate their own tower networks generally are substantially larger and have greater financial resources than we have we believe that tower location deployment speed capacity quality of service and price have been and will continue to be the most significant competitive factors affecting the leasing of a tower 

some of the larger independent tower companies with which ccusa competes in the us include american tower corporation sba communications corporation and global tower partners significant additional site rental competition comes from the leasing of rooftops utility structures and other alternative sites for antennas 

competitors in the network services business include site acquisition consultants zoning consultants real estate firms rightofway consulting firms construction companies tower ownersmanagers radio frequency engineering consultants telecommunications equipment vendors who can provide turnkey site development services through multiple subcontractors and our customers’ internal staffs we believe that carriers base their decisions on the outsourcing of network services on criteria such as a company’s experience track record local reputation price and time for completion of a project see “ item 1a risk factors — we operate our business in a competitive industry and some of our competitors have significantly more resources or less debt than we do” 

ccal 

our primary business in australia is the leasing of antenna space on towers to our customers ccal a joint venture which is owned 776 by us and 224 by permanent nominees aust ltd acting on behalf of a group of professional and institutional investors led by jump capital limited is our principal australian operating subsidiary ccal is the largest independent tower operator in australia as of december 31 2006 ccal had 1387 towers with a strategic presence in each of australia’s major metropolitan areas including sydney melbourne brisbane adelaide and perth 

for the year ended december 31 2006 ccal comprised 76 of our consolidated revenues ccal’s principal customers are optus vodafone australia hutchison and telstra for the year ended december 31 2006 these four carriers accounted for approximately 944 of ccal’s revenues with vodafone australia and optus accounting for 345 and 341 respectively see “ item 1a risk factors—a substantial portion of our revenues is derived from a small number of customers ” 

the majority of ccal towers were acquired from optus and vodafone australia in 2000 and 2001 respectively in connection with these transactions optus agreed to lease space on the former optus towers for an initial term of 15 years and vodafone australia agreed to lease space on the former vodafone australia towers for an initial rent free term of 10 years 

in australia ccal competes with wireless carriers which own and operate their own tower networks service companies that provide site maintenance and property management services and other site owners such as broadcasters and building owners the two other significant tower owners in australia are broadcast australia and telstra we believe that tower location capacity quality of service deployment speed and price within a geographic market are the most significant competitive factors affecting the leasing of a site 

several 3g networks continue to be developed in australia two metropolitan networks are being built by joint ventures between hutchison and telstra and between optus and vodafone australia respectively in addition telstra has constructed the first phase of a new national 3g network which is currently not shared with hutchison to replace one of its existing networks the telstra network was launched commercially in october 2006 each of the 3g networks has already utilized a number of our towers in connection with its deployment and we expect more 

  

of our towers will be utilized by each of the networks in 2007 in addition optus recently announced plans to provide nationwide 3g coverage with deployment commencing in 2007 unwired australia and personal broadband australia also continued their deployment of broadband wireless networks providing high speed internet services to consumers in 2006 which are currently operating in key metropolitan markets 

emerging businesses 

we have pursued and are currently pursuing other strategic opportunities or adjacent businesses which we believe exhibit sufficient potential to achieve acceptable riskadjusted returns or exhibit potential to complement our core tower rental business such emerging adjacent businesses currently consist of modeo 

modeo was formed in 2004 to explore a potential offering of live digital television and audio broadcast and podcasting to mobile devices such as wireless phones modeo plans to offer this service as a wholesale network provider utilizing the spectrum under our 16701675 mhz us nationwide spectrum license having an initial term of 10 years which we acquired in 2003 through a federal communications commission “fcc” auction modeo broadcasts its service using the digital video broadcast to handheld “dvbh” standard the open standard for the broadcast of digital television to mobile devices modeo has had no revenues since inception 

during 2006 modeo completed the development of a commercial grade mobile television dvbh network in new york city in december 2006 modeo launched a live commercial quality mobile television beta service in new york city that includes live video content from leading network programmers as well as streaming audio content modeo plans to stage its new york beta activities in phases throughout the first and second quarters of 2007 which will include establishing a formal beta test group after we have received and evaluated the feedback from these beta activities we will review and evaluate our options for expanding the modeo network beyond new york city we continue to evaluate the potential options for funding the build out of the modeo network beyond new york city which include nonrecourse debt secured by our 16701675 mhz spectrum license equity investors in modeo joint venture proposals proposals to sell a controlling interest in modeo along with a combination of the above 

many other companies some with significantly greater resources than us offer or plan to offer video and audio content to wireless handsets and other mobile devices although modeo’s planned services are not yet commercially available modeo competes with these other offerings in bringing its service to commercial availability if and when modeo’s planned service becomes commercially available modeo will compete with these offerings to capture potential subscribers and market share in particular qualcomm has announced that it is currently developing a multicast digital video service marketed under the brand name mediaflo verizon wireless and att formerly cingular wireless have announced that they plan to offer their customers mobile video services over the mediaflo network in addition modeo may face competition from other companies offering podcasting and alternate methods of distributing video and audio to handheld devices see “ item 1a risk factors—modeo’s business has certain risk factors different from our core tower business including an unproven business model ” 

employees 

at february 20 2007 we employed approximately 1160 people worldwide inclusive of approximately 210 people previously employed by global signal who are providing services only during the integration of the global signal business we are not a party to any collective bargaining agreements we have not experienced any strikes or work stoppages and management believes that our employee relations are satisfactory 

regulatory matters 

to date we have not incurred any material fines or penalties or experienced any material adverse effects to our business as a result of any domestic or international regulations the summary below is based on regulations currently in effect and such regulations are subject to review and modification by the applicable governmental authority from time to time see “ item 1a risk factors—laws and regulations which may change at any time and with which we may fail to comply regulate our business ” 

  

united states 

federal regulations 

both the fcc and the federal aviation administration “faa” regulate towers used for wireless communications transmitters and receivers such regulations control the siting and marking of towers and may depending on the characteristics of particular towers require the registration of tower facilities and the issuance of determinations confirming no hazard to air traffic wireless communications devices operating on towers are separately regulated and independently licensed based upon the particular frequency used in addition the fcc and the faa have developed standards to consider proposals for new or modified tower and antenna structures based upon the height and location including proximity to airports proposals to construct or to modify existing tower and antenna structures above certain heights are reviewed by the faa to ensure the structure will not present a hazard to aviation which determination may be conditioned upon compliance with lighting and marking requirements the fcc requires its licensees to operate communications devices only on towers that comply with faa rules and are registered with the fcc if required by its regulations where tower lighting is required by faa regulation tower owners bear the responsibility of notifying the faa of any tower lighting outage failure to comply with the applicable requirements may lead to civil penalties 

local regulations 

the us telecommunications act of 1996 amended the communications act of 1934 to preserve state and local zoning authorities’ jurisdiction over the siting of communications towers the law however limits local zoning authority by prohibiting actions by local authorities that discriminate between different service providers of wireless services or ban altogether the provision of wireless services additionally the law prohibits state and local restrictions based on the environmental effects of radiofrequency emissions to the extent the facilities comply with fcc regulations 

local regulations include city and other local ordinances including subdivision and zoning ordinances approvals for construction modification and removal of towers and restrictive covenants imposed by community developers these regulations vary greatly but typically require us to obtain approval from local officials prior to tower construction local zoning authorities may render decisions that prevent the construction or modification of towers or place conditions on such construction or modifications that are responsive to community residents’ concerns regarding the height visibility and other characteristics of the towers 

other regulations 

we hold through certain of our subsidiaries certain licenses for radio transmission facilities granted by the fcc including licenses for common carrier microwave service commercial and private mobile radio service specialized mobile radio and paging service which are subject to additional regulation by the fcc our fcc license relating to the 1670 to 1675 mhz spectrum band contains certain conditions related to the services that may be provided thereunder the technical equipment used in connection therewith and the circumstances under which it may be renewed we are required to obtain the fcc’s approval prior to assigning or transferring control of any of our fcc licenses 

australia 

federal regulation 

carrier licenses and nominated carrier declarations issued under the australian telecommunications act 1997 authorize the use of network units for the supply of telecommunications services to the public the definition of “network units” includes line links and base stations used for wireless telephony services but does not include tower infrastructure accordingly ccal as a tower owner and operator does not require a carrier license similarly because ccal does not own any transmitters or spectrum it does not currently require any apparatus or spectrum licenses issued under the australian radiocommunications act 1992 

  

carriers have a statutory obligation to provide other carriers with access to towers and if there is a dispute including a pricing dispute the matter may be referred to the australian competition and consumer commission for resolution as a noncarrier ccal is not subject to this regime and our customers negotiate site access on a commercial basis 

while the australian telecommunications act 1997 grants certain exemptions from planning laws for the installation of “low impact facilities” newly constructed towers are expressly excluded from the definition of “low impact facilities” accordingly in connection with the construction of towers ccal is subject to state and local planning laws which vary on a site by site basis structural enhancements may be undertaken on behalf of a carrier without state and local planning approval under the general “maintenance power” under the australian telecommunications act 1997 although these enhancements may be subject to state and local planning laws if ccal is unable to obtain carrier cooperation to use that legislative power for a limited number of towers ccal is also required to install aircraft warning lighting in compliance with federal aviation regulations in australia a carrier may arguably be able to utilize the “maintenance power” under the australian telecommunications act of 1997 to remain as a tenant on a tower after the expiration of a site license or sublease however ccal’s customer access agreements generally limit the ability of customers to do this and even if a carrier did utilize this power the carrier would be required to pay for ccal’s financial loss which would roughly equal the tower rental that would have otherwise been payable 

local regulations 

in australia there are various local state and territory laws and regulations which relate to among other things town planning and zoning restrictions standards and approvals for the design construction or alteration of a structure or facility and environmental regulations as in the us these laws vary greatly but typically require tower owners to obtain approval from governmental bodies prior to tower construction and to comply with environmental laws on an ongoing basis 

environmental matters 

to date we have not incurred any material fines or penalties or experienced any material adverse effects to our business as a result of any domestic or international environmental regulations or matters see “ item 1a risk factors—laws and regulations which may change at any time and with which we may fail to comply regulate our business” and “—emissions from antennas on our towers or wireless devices may create health risks ” 

the construction of new towers in the us may be subject to environmental review under the national environmental policy act of 1969 which requires federal agencies to evaluate the environmental impact of major federal actions the fcc has promulgated regulations implementing the national environmental policy act which require applicants to investigate the potential environmental impact of the proposed tower construction should the proposed tower construction present a significant environmental impact the fcc must prepare an environmental impact statement subject to public comment if a proposed tower may have a significant impact on the environment the fcc’s approval of the construction could be significantly delayed 

our operations are subject to federal state and local laws and regulations relating to the management use storage disposal emission and remediation of and exposure to hazardous and nonhazardous substances materials and wastes as an owner lessee or operator of real property we are subject to certain environmental laws that impose strict jointandseveral liability for the cleanup of onsite or offsite contamination relating to existing or historical operations and we could also be subject to personal injury or property damage claims relating to such contamination we are potentially subject to environmental and cleanup liabilities in the us and australia 

as licensees and tower owners we are also subject to regulations and guidelines that impose a variety of operational requirements relating to radio frequency emissions as employers we are subject to osha and similar occupational health and safety legislation in australia and similar guidelines regarding employee protection from radio frequency exposure the potential connection between radio frequency emissions and certain negative health effects including some forms of cancer has been the subject of substantial study by the scientific community in recent years 

  

we have compliance programs and monitoring projects to help assure that we are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws nevertheless there can be no assurance that the costs of compliance with existing or future environmental laws will not have a material adverse effect on us 

 

tablestart 


 item 1a risk factors tableend you should carefully consider the risks described below as well as the other information contained in this document when evaluating your investment in our securities 

global signal merger—the global signal merger may cause disruptions in our business which may have an adverse effect on our business and financial results 

the global signal merger could cause disruptions in or otherwise negatively impact our business among other things 

 

  

  

 performance of assets acquired in the global signal merger—the assets acquired in the global signal merger may not perform as expected which may have an adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

in evaluating the anticipated benefits of a potential transaction with global signal we performed due diligence on global signal’s tower portfolio and other assets to be acquired in the global signal merger which due diligence included among other things analyzing tower locations visiting select towers evaluating radio frequency information and evaluating potential carrier customer demand the results of this due diligence were used to support assumptions that were made by us in creating financial models to evaluate the potential future performance of global signal’s assets and the combined company there can be no assurances that the towers and other assets of global signal will perform as expected by us based on our due diligence and provide us with the benefits that have been anticipated a variety of factors could cause these assets not to provide such benefits including among other things 

 

  

  

 if global signal’s assets fail to perform as expected or we fail to otherwise realize the anticipated benefits of global signal’s assets for these or other reasons our business financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected 

integration of global signal—the integration of global signal is expected to result in substantial expenses and may present significant challenges 

we may face significant challenges in combining global signal’s operations in a timely and efficient manner and retaining key global signal personnel this integration will be complex and timeconsuming the failure to successfully integrate global signal’s business and to manage the challenges presented by the integration process successfully including the retention of key global signal personnel may result in us and our stockholders not achieving the anticipated potential benefits of the global signal merger 

  

achieving the benefits of the global signal merger will depend in part on the integration of global signal’s operations wireless communications tower portfolio and personnel in a timely and efficient manner and our ability to realize the anticipated synergies from this integration this integration may be difficult and unpredictable for many reasons including among others the size of global signal’s wireless communications tower portfolio and because global signal’s and our internal systems and processes were developed without regard to such integration successful integration of global signal also requires coordination of personnel which may be difficult and unpredictable because of possible cultural conflicts and differences in policies procedures and operations between the companies and the different geographical locations of the companies and their assets if the integration is not successful we might not realize the expected benefits of the merger which could adversely affect our business and the value of our common stock after the merger 

we expect to incur substantial expenses in connection with the integration of the global signal business into our policies procedures operations and systems there are a large number of systems that must be integrated including management information accounting and finance sales billing payroll and benefits lease administration systems and regulatory compliance 

although we expect that the realization of efficiencies related to the integration of the global signal business may offset incremental transaction mergerrelated and restructuring costs over time no assurances can be made that this net benefit will be achieved in the near term or at all and there are a number of factors some of which are beyond our control that could affect the total amount or the timing of all of the expected integration expenses 

our business depends on the demand for wireless communications and towers—we may be adversely affected by any slowdown in such demand including a slowdown attributable to wireless carrier consolidation or by the sharing of networks by wireless carriers 

demand for our towers depends on demand for antenna space from our customers which in turn depends on the demand for wireless services the willingness of our customers to utilize our infrastructure or renew existing leases on our towers will be affected by numerous factors including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 a slowdown in demand for a particular wireless segment may adversely affect the demand for our towers moreover some wireless carriers operate with substantial indebtedness and financial problems for our customers may result in accounts receivable going uncollected the loss of a customer and associated lease revenue or a reduced ability of these customers to finance expansion activities 

a slowdown in the deployment of equipment for new wireless technologies the consolidation of wireless carriers the sharing of networks by wireless carriers or the increased use of alternative sites may also adversely affect the demand for our towers in addition advances in technology such as the development of new antenna systems new terrestrial deployment technologies and new satellite systems may reduce the need for landbased or terrestrial transmission networks or our towers to some extent almost all of the above factors have occurred in recent years with an adverse effect on our business and such factors are likely to persist in the future the occurrence of any of these factors may negatively impact our revenues result in an impairment of our assets or otherwise have a material adverse effect on us 

  

a substantial portion of our revenues is derived from a small number of customers—the loss or consolidation of network sharing among or financial instability of any of our limited number of customers may materially decrease revenues 

for the year ended december 31 2006 approximately 672 of our consolidated revenue was derived from sprint nextel cingular verizon wireless and tmobile which represented 148 235 203 and 86 respectively of our consolidated revenues for the year ended december 31 2006 on a pro forma basis as if the global signal merger was completed january 1 2006 approximately 683 of our total combined revenues were derived from sprint nextel cingular verizon wireless and tmobile which represented 242 204 153 and 84 of our consolidated revenues respectively the loss of any one of our large customers as a result of bankruptcy consolidation merger with other customers of ours or otherwise may materially decrease our revenues and have other adverse effects on our business we cannot guarantee that the leases including management service agreements with our major wireless carriers will not be terminated or that these carriers will renew such agreements 

wireless carriers frequently enter into agreements with their competitors allowing them to utilize one another’s towers to accommodate customers who are out of range of their home providers’ services in addition wireless carriers have also entered into agreements allowing two or more carriers to share a single wireless network or jointly develop a tower portfolio in certain locations such agreements may be viewed by wireless carriers as a superior alternative to leasing space for their own antennas on our towers the proliferation of these roaming network sharing and joint development agreements may have a material adverse effect on us 

in the ordinary course of business we also sometimes experience disputes with customers generally regarding the interpretation of terms in their respective agreements although historically we have resolved these disputes on commercially reasonable terms future disputes could lead to increased tensions and damaged relationships with customers that could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition if we are forced to resolve any of these disputes through litigation our relationship with the applicable customer could be damaged which could lead to decreased revenues including as a result of losing a customer or increased costs resulting in a corresponding adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

wireless carrier consolidation—consolidation among customers may result in duplicate or overlapping parts of networks which may result in a reduction of sites and have a negative effect on revenues and cash flows 

consolidation among customers will likely result in duplicate or overlapping parts of networks which may result in a reduction of cell sites and impact revenues from our towers in recent years certain of our larger carrier customers have merged including cingular wireless now known as att with att wireless in october 2004 and sprint with nextel in august 2005 recent regulatory developments have made consolidation in the wireless industry easier and more likely for example in february 2002 the fcc enabled the ownership by a single entity of interests in both cellular carriers in overlapping metropolitan cellular service areas in january 2003 the fcc eliminated the spectrum aggregation cap in a geographic area in favor of a casebycase review of spectrum transactions it is possible that at least some customers may take advantage of this relaxation of spectrum and ownership limitations and consolidate their businesses any industry consolidation could decrease the demand for our towers which in turn may result in a reduction in our revenues 

substantial level of indebtedness—our substantial level of indebtedness may adversely affect our ability to react to changes in our business we may also be limited in our ability to use debt to fund future capital needs 

we have a substantial amount of indebtedness as a consequence of our indebtedness we 1 are subject to restrictive covenants that further limit our financial and operating flexibility and 2 may choose to institute selfimposed limits on our indebtedness based on certain considerations including market interest rates our relative leverage and our strategic plans for example the limits imposed by our indebtedness restrict under certain circumstances our and certain of our respective subsidiaries’ ability to take various actions including incurring additional debt guaranteeing indebtedness issuing preferred stock engaging in various types of transactions such as mergers and sales of assets and paying dividends and making distributions or other restricted payments and investments these restrictions could have an adverse effect on our business by limiting our ability to take advantage of financing new tower development mergers and acquisitions or other opportunities 

  

the following chart sets forth certain important credit information and is presented on a us gaap basis as of december 31 2006 postmerger and after giving effect to the 6000 million term loan entered into in january 2007 “2007 term loan” and the january 2007 stock purchase 

 

 as a result of our substantial debt demands on our cash resources will increase which could negatively impact our business results of operations and financial condition and the market price of our common stock as a result of our substantial indebtedness 

 

  

  

  

  

 we cannot guarantee that we will be able to generate enough cash flow from operations or that we will be able to obtain enough capital to service our debt or pay our obligations under our preferred stock in addition we may need to refinance some or all of our indebtedness and preferred stock on or before maturity if we are unable to refinance our debt or renegotiate the terms of such debt we may not be able to meet our debt service requirements in the future 

fluctuations in market interest rates may increase interest expense relating to our floating rate indebtedness as of december 31 2006 postmerger and after giving effect to the 2007 term loan approximately 899 of our outstanding indebtedness consists of longterm fixed interest rate notes in addition there is no guarantee future refinancing of our indebtedness will have fixed interest rates or that interest rates on such indebtedness will be equal to or lower than the rates on our current indebtedness 

crown castle international corp “ccic” is a holding company with no business operations of its own we conduct all of our business operations through our subsidiaries as of january 31 2007 approximately 11 of our consolidated indebtedness was held at the holding company level another 101 of our consolidated indebtedness is unconditionally guaranteed by the holding company accordingly our only source of cash to pay interest and principal on our outstanding indebtedness held at the holding company level is distributions relating to our ownership interest in our subsidiaries from the cash flows and net earnings generated by such subsidiaries or from proceeds of debt equity offerings sale of fibertower or modeo or certain asset sales if our subsidiaries are unable to dividend cash to us when we need it we may be unable to satisfy our obligations including interest and principal payments under our debt instruments 

economic and wireless telecommunications industry slowdown—an economic or wireless telecommunications industry slowdown may materially and adversely affect our business including reducing demand for our towers and network services and the business of our customers 

in past years the us economy including the wireless telecommunications industry has experienced significant general slowdowns which negatively affected the factors described in these risk factors influencing demand for tower space and network services similar slowdowns in the us or australia in the future may reduce consumer demand for wireless services or negatively impact the debt and equity markets thereby causing carriers to delay or abandon implementation of new systems and technologies including 3g and other wireless broadband services further unforeseen events including the war on terrorism the threat of additional terrorist attacks the political and 

  

economic uncertainties resulting therefrom may impose additional risks upon and adversely affect the wireless telecommunications industry and us 

we believe that the prior economic slowdowns in the us particularly in the wireless telecommunications industry have harmed and similar slowdowns in the us or australia may further harm the financial condition or operations of wireless carriers some of which including customers of ours have filed for bankruptcy protection 

we operate our business in a competitive industry and some of our competitors have significantly more resources or less debt than we do—as a result of this competition we may find it more difficult to achieve favorable lease rates on our towers 

we face competition for site rental customers from various sources including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 wireless carriers that own and operate their own tower portfolios generally are substantially larger particularly given the impact of recently completed wireless carrier mergers and have greater financial resources than we have competition for tenants on towers may adversely affect lease rates and revenues 

new technologies may make our tower leasing service less desirable to potential tenants and result in decreasing revenues—such new technologies may significantly reduce demand for tower leases and negatively impact the growth in our revenues 

the development and deployment of signal combining technologies which permit one antenna to service multiple frequencies and thereby multiple customers may reduce the need for our antenna space in addition other technologies such as das wireless mesh networks mobile satellite systems and the delivery of video services by direct broadcast satellites may in the future serve as substitutes for or alternatives to leasing that might otherwise be anticipated or expected on our towers had such technologies not existed any reduction in tower leasing demand resulting from multiple frequency antennas satellite das mesh networks or other technologies may negatively impact our revenues or otherwise have a material adverse effect on us 

new technologies may not perform as projected—new wireless technologies may not deploy or be adopted by customers as rapidly or in the manner projected 

there can be no assurances that 3g wireless data services or other new wireless technologies will be introduced or deployed as rapidly or in the manner previously or presently projected by the wireless or broadcast industries in addition demand and customer adoption rates for such new technologies may be lower or slower than anticipated for numerous reasons as a result growth opportunities and demand for site rental as a result of such technologies may not be realized at the times or to the extent previously or presently anticipated 

we generally lease or sublease the land under our towers and may not be able to extend these leases—if we fail to protect our rights against persons claiming superior rights to the land on which our towers are located our business may be adversely affected 

our real property interests relating to the land on which our towers are located consist primarily of leasehold and subleasehold interests fee interests easements licenses and rightsofway a loss of these interests may interfere with our ability to conduct our business and generate revenues for various reasons we may not always have the ability to access analyze and verify all information regarding titles and other issues prior to completing an acquisition of towers further we may not be able to renew ground leases on commercially viable terms post 

  

merger approximately 98 of our towers are on land where our property interests in such land have a final expiration date of less than 10 years our inability to protect our rights to the land under our towers may have a material adverse affect on us 

our ability to protect our rights against persons claiming superior rights in towers or real property depends on our ability to 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 we may need additional financing which may not be available for strategic growth opportunities—if we are unable to raise capital in the future when needed we may not be able to fund future growth opportunities 

in the future we may require significant capital expenditures for strategic growth opportunities as of december 31 2006 postmerger and after giving effect to the 2007 term loan and the january 2007 stock purchase we had consolidated cash and cash equivalents of 1394 million and restricted cash of 1375 million in addition we have 2500 million of availability under our senior secured revolving credit facility “2007 revolver” we may need additional sources of debt or equity capital in the future to fund future growth opportunities additional financing may be unavailable may be prohibitively expensive or may be restricted by the terms of our outstanding indebtedness additional sales of equity securities would dilute our existing stockholders if we are unable to raise capital when our needs arise we may not be able to fund future growth opportunities 

modeo’s business has certain risk factors different from our core tower business including an unproven business model—modeo’s business may fail to operate successfully and produce results that are less than anticipated 

modeo is a new company with no operating history and may not be able to operate successfully modeo has an unproven business model and operates in the new largely untested and rapidly evolving mobile media market modeo is subject to all of the business risks and uncertainties associated with any new business enterprise modeo has had no revenues since inception we expect modeo to experience initial operating losses due to the costs and expenses associated with a startup operation no assurance can be made that modeo will ever generate positive cash flows or that losses recorded from modeo will not increase in the future 

modeo’s planned business model assumptions include 

 

  

  

  

 if any of the assumptions is incorrect modeo’s proposed business will be harmed and may not become commercially available or survive 

  

in addition modeo’s ability to achieve its strategic objectives will depend in large part upon the successful timely and costeffective completion of a dvbh network beyond new york city a variety of factors uncertainties and contingencies could affect or prevent the successful timely and costeffective build out of the planned modeo network including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 we continue to evaluate the potential options for funding the build out of the modeo network beyond new york city which include nonrecourse debt secured by our 16701675 mhz spectrum license equity investors in modeo joint venture proposals proposals to sell a controlling interest in modeo along with a combination of the above there can be no assurances that we will be able to obtain additional third party financing on terms acceptable to us or that modeo will be able to complete a dvbh network beyond new york city in a timely manner or at all if we are unable to raise additional capital from third party investors on acceptable terms in a timely manner or if modeo is otherwise unable to meet its network development targets then modeo may not be able to implement its current business plan and modeo’s planned mobile media service may not become operationally active or commercially available 

many other companies some with significantly greater resources than us currently offer or plan to offer video and audio content to wireless handsets and other mobile devices although modeo’s planned services are not yet commercially available modeo competes with these other offerings in bringing its service to commercial availability if and when modeo’s planned service becomes commercially available modeo will compete with these offerings in capturing potential subscribers and market share sprint nextel att formerly cingular wireless and verizon wireless currently offer streaming video services over their networks under the brand names sprint tv mobitv and vcast respectively in addition qualcomm has announced that it is developing a multicast digital video service marketed under the brand name mediaflo verizon wireless and att formerly cingular wireless have announced that they plan to offer their customers mobile video services over the mediaflo network modeo’s planned service offering may also face competition from other companies offering podcasting and alternate methods of distributing video and audio to mobile devices as a result of such competition modeo may not become viable or gain market share 

there can be no assurances that wireless carriers will adopt a wholesale model such as modeo’s to provide video and audio services to their subscribers modeo’s failure to operate successfully or accomplish its strategic objectives could negatively impact modeo’s ability to generate positive cash flow could require us to dispose of all or part of modeo’s business and assets including the fcc spectrum license or otherwise have an adverse effect on us 

fibertower’s business has certain risk factors different from our core tower business including an unproven business model—fibertower’s business may produce results that are less than anticipated resulting in a writeoff of all or part of our investment in fibertower 

fibertower commenced its principal operations in 2003 and has a limited operating history fibertower has an unproven business model and operates in the new and largely untested market for facilitiesbased wireless backhaul services as such fibertower is subject to all of the business risks and uncertainties associated with any new business enterprise and may not be able to operate successfully fibertower has generated losses since inception we anticipate that fibertower will continue to generate losses for the foreseeable future and may need additional funding to support the development of its business model although we believe that there will be demand for the backhaul solutions fibertower provides to wireless carriers as the demand for additional wireless minutes of use 

  

increases no assurances can be made that fibertower will ever generate positive cash flows or that it will produce the results anticipated at the time of our investment in addition as a minority shareholder we have a limited ability to affect fibertower’s operations additional risk factors relating to fibertower’s business can be found in fibertower’s filings with the sec 

our investment in fibertower is classified as an availableforsale security carried at fair value on our consolidated balance sheet the net unrealized gains or losses on our investment as a result of fluctuations in fibertower’s share price are reported as accumulated other comprehensive income unless such changes are deemed other than temporary fibertower’s failure to operate successfully gain market share or accomplish its strategic objectives could negatively impact fibertower’s per share price and could require us to writeoff all or a portion of our investment in fibertower as of january 31 2007 the fair value of our investment in fibertower was 1378 million at 523 per fibertower share as of january 31 2007 the unrealized investment gain included in accumulated other comprehensive income totaled 21 million or equivalent to 008 per fibertower share although we currently have no plans to do so should we choose to liquidate our investment in fibertower we can provide no assurances that we will be able to do so at a desirable value in addition our investment in fibertower is subject to certain transfer restrictions that terminate in august 2007 or earlier in some cases 

laws and regulations which may change at any time and with which we may fail to comply regulate our business—if we fail to comply with applicable laws or regulations we may be fined or even lose our right to conduct some of our business 

a variety of federal state local and foreign laws and regulations apply to our business failure to comply with applicable requirements may lead to civil penalties or require us to assume indemnification obligations or breach contractual provisions we cannot guarantee that existing or future laws or regulations including state and local tax laws will not adversely affect our business increase delays or result in additional costs these factors may have a material adverse effect on us 

shares eligible for future sale—sales or issuances of a substantial number of shares of common stock may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

future sales of a substantial number of shares of common stock may adversely affect the market price of our common stock as of february 20 2007 we had 2828 million shares of common stock outstanding in addition we have reserved 1 165 million shares of common stock for future issuance under our various stock compensation plans 2 12 million shares of common stock upon exercise of outstanding warrants inclusive of 06 million shares of common stock as a result of the global signal merger 3 59 million shares of common stock for the conversion of our 4 convertible senior notes and 4 86 million shares of common stock for the conversion of our outstanding convertible preferred stock 

a small number of stockholders own a significant percentage of our outstanding common stock in addition pursuant to the stockholders agreement we have filed with the sec a registration statement covering certain shares of common stock issued to the global signal significant stockholders in the global signal merger the global signal significant stockholders are subject to certain restrictions on their ability to sell or otherwise dispose of their shares of common stock for a period of up to 180 days after the closing of the global signal merger if any one of these stockholders or any group of our stockholders sells a large quantity of shares of our common stock or the public market perceives that existing stockholders might sell shares of our common stock the market price of our common stock may significantly decline 

the holders of our 625 convertible preferred stock “625 convertible preferred stock” are entitled to receive cumulative dividends at the rate of 625 per annum approximately 199 million per annum payable on a quarterly basis we have the option to pay the dividends on such series of preferred stock in cash or in shares of common stock at various times in the past we have paid such dividends with shares of common stock and we may elect to do so again in the future from time to time the number of shares of common stock required to be issued to pay such dividends is dependent upon the current market value of our common stock at the time such dividend is required to be paid 

  

we are heavily dependent on our senior management—if we lose members of our senior management we may not be able to find appropriate replacements on a timely basis and our business may be adversely affected 

our existing operations and continued future development depend to a significant extent upon the performance and active participation of certain key individuals as employees including our chief executive officer we cannot guarantee that we will be successful in retaining the services of these or other key personnel if we were to lose any of these individuals we may not be able to find or integrate appropriate replacements on a timely basis and we may be materially adversely affected 

variability in demand for network services business reduces the predictability of our results—our network services business has historically experienced significant volatility in demand 

the operating results of our network services business for any particular period may vary significantly and should not necessarily be considered indicative of longerterm results for this activity network services revenues declined as a percentage of our total revenues during 2003 and 2004 reflecting our efforts to deemphasize this area of our business and increased competition while such revenues increased modestly in 2005 and 2006 in the foreseeable future network services revenues may decline as a percentage of our total revenues due to our focus on our core leasing business increased competition or other factors 

emissions from antennas on our towers or wireless devices may create health risks—if radio frequency emissions from wireless handsets or equipment on our towers are demonstrated to cause negative health effects potential future claims could adversely affect our operations costs and revenues 

the fcc and other government agencies impose requirements and other guidelines on their licensees relating to radio frequency emissions the potential connection between radio frequency emissions and certain negative health effects including some forms of cancer has been the subject of substantial study by the scientific community in recent years we cannot guarantee that claims relating to radio frequency emissions will not arise in the future or that the results of such studies will not be adverse to us 

public perception of possible health risks associated with cellular and other wireless communications may slow or diminish the growth of wireless companies which may in turn slow or diminish our growth in particular negative public perception of and regulations regarding these perceived health risks may slow or diminish the market acceptance of wireless communications services 

if a connection between radio emissions and possible negative health effects were established our operations costs and revenues may be materially and adversely affected we currently do not maintain any significant insurance with respect to these matters 

antitakeover provisions in our certificate of incorporation and competition laws may have effects that conflict with the interests of our stockholders—certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation bylaws and operative agreements and domestic and international competition laws may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us or for us to acquire control of a third party even if such a change in control would be beneficial to you 

we have a number of antitakeover devices in place that will hinder takeover attempts and may reduce the market value of our common stock our antitakeover provisions include 

 

  

  

  

   

our bylaws permit special meetings of the stockholders to be called only upon the request of a majority of the board of directors and deny stockholders the ability to call such meetings such provisions as well as the provisions of section 203 of the delaware general corporation law may impede a merger consolidation takeover or other business combination or discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us 

in addition domestic and international competition laws may prevent or discourage us from acquiring towers or tower networks in certain geographical areas or impede a merger consolidation takeover or other business combination or discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us 

our operations outside the us expose us to changes in foreign currency exchange rates—we may suffer losses as a result of changes in such currency exchange rates 

after giving effect to the global signal merger we conduct business in australia canada and united kingdom which exposes us to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates for the year ended december 31 2006 approximately 93 of our consolidated revenues originated outside the us all of which were denominated in currencies other than us dollars principally australian dollars we have not historically engaged in significant hedging activities relating to our nonus dollar operations and we may suffer future losses as a result of changes in currency exchange rates approximately 1 of the revenue expected to be realized from the global signal business will be denominated in currencies other than us dollars

 item 2 properties tableend our principal corporate offices are located in houston texas canonsburg pennsylvania and sydney australia as a result of the global signal merger a lease for office space with an end date in 2010 relating to the global signal corporate office in sarasota florida remains in effect 

 

 in the us we also lease and maintain three additional area offices “area offices” in addition to the area office operated from our canonsburg pennsylvania office located in 1 charlotte north carolina 2 alpharetta georgia and 3 phoenix arizona the principal responsibilities of these offices are to manage the leasing of tower space on a local basis maintain the towers already located in the area and service our customers in the area in addition we lease additional smaller district offices which report to the area offices in locations with high tower concentrations we anticipate the expansion of certain area offices and district offices in 2007 as a result of the global signal merger 

in the ccusa portfolio postmerger 184 of the towers are guyed towers 346 are self support lattice towers 12 are rooftop installations and the remaining 455 are predominantly monopoles typical guyed towers are generally located on larger tracts of land of up to 7 acres while nonguyed towers are generally located on smaller tracts of land that typically range from approximately 1600 to 22000 square feet these tracts of land support the towers equipment shelters and where applicable guy wires to stabilize the structure the actual square footage of the land relating to any particular tower depends on a number of things including the topography of the site the size of the area the landlord is willing to lease the number of customers locating on the tower and the type of structure at the site 

as of december 31 2006 postmerger we own in fee or have permanent or longterm easements in the land on which 3926 of our ccusa towers reside or approximately 176 of our ccusa portfolio and we lease sublease or license the land on which 17611 of our ccusa towers reside in addition as of december 31 2006 postmerger ccusa managed 737 towers owned by third parties where we had the right to market space on the tower or where we had sublease arrangements with the tower owner in australia as of december 31 2006 for 1383 of our 1387 ccal towers site tenure of the land under our towers takes the form of a lease or license and we own the remaining four sites in fee our ground leases subleases and licenses generally have five or 10 year initial terms at ccusa and 10 to 15 years at ccal and frequently contain one or more renewal options 

for a tabular presentation of the remaining terms to expiration including any renewal terms at our option of the ground leases subleases or licenses for the ccusa land which we do not own and on which our towers are located as of december 31 2006 postmerger see “ item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial competition and results of operations—liquidity and capital resources—contractual cash obligations”  

in 2004 we began a program “portfolio extension program” through which we seek to 1 renegotiate and extend the terms of the ground leases subleases and licenses relating to the land on which our ccusa towers are located or 2 purchase the land on which such towers reside global signal had an ongoing initiative similar to the portfolio extension program which we expect to continue after the global signal merger see “ item 1a risk factors—we generally lease or sublease the land under our towers and may not be able to extend these leases ” 

on june 8 2005 we issued 19 billion aggregate principal amount of 2005 tower revenue notes on november 29 2006 we issued 155 billion aggregate principal amount of 2006 tower revenue notes as additional debt securities under the existing indenture pursuant to which the 2005 tower revenue notes were issued in 2005 the 2005 tower revenue notes and 2006 tower revenue notes are effectively secured by 6639 of our ccusa towers and the cash flows from those towers governing instruments related to another 4901 towers prevent liens 

  

from being granted on those towers without approval of a subsidiary of verizon however distributions paid from the entities that own those towers will also service these notes 

approximately 8975 of the 10749 towers acquired as a result of the global signal merger and the cash flows from those towers are effectively pledged as security for debt of global signal consisting of the commercial mortgage passthrough certificates series 20042 “2004 mortgage loan” and the commercial mortgage passthrough certificates series 20061 “2006 mortgage loan” the 2004 mortgage loan and the 2006 mortgage loan remain outstanding as obligations of the global signal entities we acquired in the global signal merger 

substantially all of our ccusa towers can accommodate another tenant either as currently constructed or with appropriate modifications to the tower additionally if so inclined as a result of customer demand we could generally also tear down an existing tower and reconstruct another tower in its place with additional capacity subject to certain restrictions as of december 31 2006 postmerger the weighted average number of tenants per tower is approximately 250 on our 22274 ccusa towers a summary of the number of existing tenants per tower as of december 31 2006 postmerger is as follows

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend general overview 

overview 

we own operate and lease towers for wireless communications including certain rooftop installations see “item 2 properties”  we engage in such activities through a variety of structures including subleasing and management arrangements we also provide certain network services relating to our towers on a limited basis for our customers including antenna installations and subsequent augmentation network design and site selection site acquisition and site development 

as of december 31 2006 postmerger we owned leased or managed 23661 towers postmerger we have the most towers in the us of any wireless tower company with approximately 21700 towers exclusive of rooftop installations in addition we have 1387 towers in australia and the remainder of our towers are located in puerto rico and canada as of december 31 2006 postmerger approximately 55 and 72 of our us and puerto rico towers were located in the 50 and 100 largest btas respectively as of december 31 2006 postmerger we also owned leased or had easements on 280 land sites for towers owned by third parties which are located in the us and the uk as of december 31 2006 postmerger 

as of december 31 2006 postmerger we own in fee or have permanent or longterm easements in the land on which 3930 of our towers reside and we lease sublease or license the land on which 18994 of our towers reside in addition as of december 31 2006 postmerger we managed 737 towers owned by third parties where we had the right to market space on the tower or where we had sublease arrangements with the tower owner 

our customers currently include many of the world’s major wireless communications companies including sprint nextel att formerly cingular wireless verizon wireless tmobile alltel optus and vodafone australia our customers use our towers for antennas and other equipment necessary for the transmission of wireless signals for mobile telephones and other devices this leasing activity represents approximately 884 of our 2006 consolidated revenues 

as an important part of our business strategy we seek to 

 

  

  

  

   

the growth of our business depends substantially on the condition of the wireless communications industry the willingness of our customers to utilize our infrastructure and related services is affected by numerous factors including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 we believe the demand for our towers will continue for a variety of reasons including the wireless industry’s dramatic growth in minutes of use wireless data service revenues and new subscribers the demand for towers depends on the demand for antenna space from our customers which in turn depends on the demand for wireless telephony and data services from their customers important indicators of this demand are wireless minutes of use the volume of nontelephony wireless services such as data text messaging and mobile video and to a lesser extent the number of new wireless subscribers highlights of the cellular telecommunications  internet association “ctia” us wireless industry survey issued on september 13 2006 include 

 

  

  

 demand for antenna space on our towers may be influenced by the availability of new spectrum to our customers the fcc advanced wireless services auction no 66 was completed during the third quarter of 2006 this auction for 1087 licenses to use wireless spectrum raised nearly 14 billion making it the largest single fcc spectrum auction the auctioned spectrum is expected to be used for advanced mobile communications and many of our customers were among the highest bidders 

the impact of anticipated increases to site rental revenues from the demand for antenna space on our towers may be tempered somewhat by recent carrier consolidation including cingular wireless now known as att merging with att wireless in 2004 and sprint merging with nextel in 2005 which could result in duplicate or overlapping networks however we expect that the termination of leases as a result of recent carrier consolidation and related duplicate or overlapping networks will be spread over multiple quarters as existing lease obligations expire in addition we believe we are adding more leases per quarter from all of our customers than the total number of leases we believe will eventually be terminated as a result of the two mergers noted above consequently we currently do not believe that lease terminations from carrier consolidation will have a material adverse affect on our results 

when wireless carriers identify coverage or capacity gaps we seek to provide carriers with the following fourpointvalue proposition as part of our overall ongoing goal to increase customer satisfaction relative to our peers while still balancing commercial realities 

 

  

   

  

 we plan to continue to leverage our asset management tools and the strength of our management team to deliver on this fourpointvalue proposition 

current year highlights and recent developments 

acquisition of global signal on october 5 2006 we entered into a definitive agreement which contemplated the merger of global signal into a whollyowned subsidiary of ours global signal operated 10749 towers which are primarily concentrated in the southwestern midwestern pacific coast and northeastern regions of the us we completed the global signal merger on january 12 2007 in a stock and cash transaction valued at approximately 40 billion exclusive of debt of approximately 18 billion that remained outstanding as obligations of the global signal entities we acquired as a result of the completion of global signal merger we issued approximately 981 million shares of common stock to the shareholders of global signal and paid the maximum cash consideration of 5500 million and reserved for issuance approximately 06 million shares of common stock issuable pursuant to global signal warrants pursuant to the merger agreement global signal common stockholders were entitled to convert each share of global signal common stock into 161 shares of our common stock or alternatively could elect to receive cash in the amount of 5595 per global signal share following the global signal merger the former global signal shareholders owned approximately 327 of our outstanding shares see “item 1 business—global signal merger” and “item 1 business—the company—ccusa” for a further discussion of the global signal merger 

the total preliminary purchase price of approximately 40 billion includes the fair value of common stock issued using a  3420 per share value of 34 billion the cash consideration the fair value of global signal restricted common stock and warrants assumed and estimated transaction costs see note 20 to our consolidated financial statements 

we financed the cash consideration primarily with cash received from the issuance of the 2006 tower revenue notes in november 2006 upon closing of the global signal merger global signal’s subsidiaries had debt outstanding of approximately 18 billion all of which remained outstanding as obligations of the global signal entities we acquired such debt included the 2004 mortgage loan and the 2006 mortgage loan which have a structure similar to our 2005 tower revenue notes and 2006 tower revenue notes as a result we have significantly increased our interest expense see “ item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—liquidity and capital resources—financing activities ” 

global signal revenues cost of operations and gross margins for 2006 were approximately 500 million unaudited 225 million unaudited and 275 million unaudited respectively we entered into the global signal merger primarily because of the growth opportunities we anticipate the global signal tower portfolio will provide including through the leveraging of our management team and customer service across an enhanced national footprint we believe the opportunity for growth will be driven by the carrier focus on improving network quality subscriber growth increasing subscriber usage wireline replacement and next generation network builds see “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationsgeneral overviewoverview” secondarily we believe there will be synergistic opportunities provided by the global signal merger in 2007 as a result of the global signal merger we do expect a substantial increase in our general and administrative expenses from 2006 but we also anticipate a decrease in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue we also expect to incur a substantial amount of costs to integrate global signal into our internal control structure and operations 

we are in the process of finalizing the valuation of certain of global signal’s assets and liabilities including property and equipment and intangibles with a thirdparty valuation expert given the size and timing of the global signal merger the amount of certain assets and liabilities presented are based on preliminary valuations and are subject to adjustment as additional information is obtained and the thirdparty valuation is finalized the primary 

  

areas of the purchase price allocation that are not finalized relate to fair values of property and equipment intangibles restructuring and merger related liabilities other liabilities and goodwill we expect to finalize the purchase price allocation in the second or third quarters of 2007 the preliminary allocation of the total preliminary purchase price for the global signal merger subject to future adjustment in the allocation of the purchase price can be found in note 20 to our consolidated financial statements 

strong revenue growth net revenues grew by 120 and 165 for 2005 and 2006 respectively compared to the prior year which was primarily driven by site rental revenues from new tenant additions or modifications to existing installations on existing towers new towers acquired or built since the end of prior fiscal year contractual escalations on existing leases with variable escalations and increases in noncash straightline rents primarily related to the renewal of certain leases new tenant additions and modifications were influenced by the aforementioned ongoing demand for additional antenna space on our towers primarily due to the continued strong growth in the usage of wireless minutes and introduction of new data services by wireless carriers 

significant margin expansion gross margins net revenues less costs of operations grew by 138 to 4248 million and 213 to 5153 million for 2005 and 2006 respectively compared to the prior year which was primarily driven by the increase in site rental revenues the incremental margin percentage percentage of revenue growth converted to gross margin on the site rental revenue growth of 588 million and 996 million for 2005 and 2006 was 778 and 848 respectively reflecting the relatively fixed nature of the costs to operate our towers 

refinancing and issuance of indebtedness pursuant to the indenture supplement “2006 indenture supplement” dated november 29 2006 we issued the 2006 tower revenue notes as additional debt securities under the existing indenture as amended “amended indenture” pursuant to which the 2005 tower revenue notes were issued in 2005 the 2006 tower revenue notes have a weighted average fixed interest rate of approximately 571 and 786 of the outstanding balance was rated investment grade the 2005 tower revenue notes and 2006 tower revenue notes are secured by the personal property license agreements revenues or distributions related to substantially all of our us including puerto rico towers as of the date of issuance of the 2006 tower revenue notes proceeds from the 2006 tower revenue notes were used to repay our previously outstanding credit facility entered into in june 2006 “2006 credit facility” under which approximately 10 billion was outstanding at the time of repayment and the remaining proceeds were used primarily to fund the cash consideration of the global signal merger the repayment of the 2006 credit facility resulted in a loss of 47 million during november 2006 primarily consisting of the writeoff of deferred financing costs periodically we contemplate issuing additional notes under the amended indenture with a structure similar to the 2005 tower revenue notes and 2006 tower revenue notes in order to leverage growth in our site rental business see “ item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—liquidity and capital resources—financing activities ” 

on january 9 2007 ccoc entered into a credit agreement “2007 credit agreement” with a syndicate of lenders pursuant to which such lenders agreed to provide the 2007 revolver in the amount of 2500 million which matures in january 2008 the proceeds of the 2007 revolver may be used for general corporate which may include the financing of capital expenditures acquisitions and purchases of our securities the 2007 revolver is currently undrawn on january 26 2007 ccoc entered into a term loan joinder pursuant to which ccoc borrowed the 2007 term loan under the 2007 credit agreement the 2007 term loan matures in january 2014 the proceeds of the 2007 term loan were used for the january 2007 stock purchase see “ item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—liquidity and capital resources—financing activities ” 

we believe the aforementioned refinancing and issuance of additional indebtedness provide us flexibility to invest expected future cash flows in activities that we believe exhibit potential to achieve acceptable riskadjusted returns or exhibit potential to complement our core tower rental business such activities could include acquiring or building towers improving existing towers purchasing our own stock or debt securities or making investments in adjacent businesses such as modeo see “ item 1 business—strategy ” in addition through the use of interest rate swap agreements we have effectively locked in the interest rate on the rollover of 1 the 2005 tower revenue notes to june 2015 2 the 2006 tower revenue notes to november 2016 3 155 billion 2006 mortgage loan to february 2016 and 4 2938 million 2004 mortgage loan to december 2014 

  

purchases and investments we believe our recent financing activities provide us significantly more flexibility to invest the cash flow produced from operations in activities that we believe exhibit potential to achieve acceptable riskadjusted returns or exhibit potential to complement our core tower rental business we anticipate investing from time to time on an ongoing basis in activities that we believe exhibit potential to achieve acceptable riskadjusted returns or exhibit potential to complement our core tower rental business such activities could include among other things acquiring or building towers improving existing towers purchasing our own stock or debt securities or making investments in adjacent businesses such as modeo see “ item 1 business—strategy ” 

in 2006 we purchased 159 million shares of common stock we utilized 5180 million in cash to affect these purchases and paid an average price of 3264 per share on january 26 2007 we purchased 177 million shares of common stock in a private transaction with certain investment funds affiliated with fortress greenhill and abrams capital we paid 6000 million in cash or approximately 3387 per share to affect the january 2007 stock purchase the purchase was primarily funded with proceeds from the 2007 term loan we expect to continue to purchase our own stock from time to time as market prices make such investments attractive see “ item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—liquidity and capital resources — overview ” for further discussion 

in july 2006 we acquired approximately 98 of the outstanding equity interests of mountain union for approximately 305 million mountain union assets at closing included 474 towers as well as 77 towers in various stages of development from mountain union in january 2007 we acquired the remaining approximate 2 interest for 48 million see “ item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—liquidity and capital resources — investing activities” 

results of operations 

overview 

revenue our primary sources of revenues are from 

 

  

 our core business is the leasing including via licensing of antenna space on our towers that can accommodate multiple tenants colocation our site rental revenues are derived from this core business which we are seeking to grow by increasing the utilization of our existing towers by increasing the number of antenna leases on our towers typically these revenues result from longterm five to 10 year contracts with our customers with renewal terms at the option of the customer as a result in any given year in excess of 90 of our site rental revenue excluding acquisitions has been contracted for in a prior year and is of a recurring nature when we discuss growth in this core business we are generally describing the rate at which we are adding revenues to the previously contracted base sometimes referred to as the revenue “runrate” site rental revenues in the us and australia are received primarily from wireless communications companies including those operating in the following categories of wireless communications 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 site rental revenues are generally recognized on a monthly basis under lease agreements which typically have original terms of five to 10 years at ccusa and original terms of 10 to 15 years at ccal the new leases recently entered into by us at ccusa typically have original terms of seven to 10 years our lease agreements at ccusa and ccal typically have three of four optional renewal periods of five or 10 years each see “ item 7 

  

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—accounting and reporting matters—critical accounting policies—revenue recognition ” and note 1 to our consolidated financial statements 

network services revenues at ccusa consist of revenues from 

 

  

  

  

  

 we provide network services such as antenna installations and subsequent augmentation network design and site selection site acquisition services site development and other services on a limited basis we have the capability and expertise to install with the assistance of our network of subcontractors equipment and antenna systems for our customers these activities are typically nonrecurring and highly competitive with a number of local competitors in most markets we typically bill for our antenna installation services on a fixed price basis network services revenues are received primarily from wireless communications companies or their agents demand for our network services fluctuates from period to period and within periods see “ item 1a risk factors ” consequently the operating results of our network services business for any particular period may vary significantly and should not be considered as indicative of longerterm results for this activity 

costs of operations costs of operations consist primarily of ground leases repairs and maintenance utilities property taxes employee compensation and related benefit costs insurance and monitoring costs generally our ground lease agreements are specific to each site and are for an initial term of five years and are renewable for predetermined periods ground lease expense is recognized on a monthly basis regardless of whether the lease agreement payment terms require us to make payments annually quarterly or in equal monthly amounts if the payment terms include fixed escalation provisions the effect of such increases is recognized on a straightline basis we calculate the straightline ground lease expense using a time period that equals or exceeds the remaining depreciable life of the tower asset in situations where tenant leases including renewal options exceed the depreciable life further when a tenant has exercisable renewal options that would compel us to exercise existing ground lease renewal options we have straightlined the ground lease expense over a sufficient portion of such ground lease renewals to coincide with the final termination of the tenant’s renewal options as a result of this accounting method a portion of the expense recognized in a given period represents cash paid in other periods because our tower operating expenses generally do not increase significantly as we add additional customers once a tower has an anchor customer additional customers provide significant incremental cash flow for any given tower costs of operations are relatively fixed over a monthly or an annual time period as such operating costs for owned towers do not generally increase significantly as additional customers are added 

costs of operations for network services consist primarily of employee compensation and related benefits costs subcontractor services consulting fees and other onsite construction and materials costs certain costs incurred in connection with antenna installations are capitalized as property and equipment since they represent assets owned by us as such those costs are not included in our results of operations in the year incurred but rather will be charged to depreciation expense over the life of the assets costs associated with contracts not complete at the end of a period are deferred and recognized when the installation becomes operational any losses on contracts are recognized at such time as they become known 

  

noncash site rental margin a summary of the noncash portions of our site rental revenues ground lease expense and stockbased compensation expense for those employees directly related to ccusa tower operations and resulting impact on our site rental gross margins is as follows 

 

 general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses consist primarily of

 integration costs integration costs are incremental noncapitalizeable costs incurred to integrate an acquired business’ operations wireless communication tower portfolio and personnel these costs primarily consist of retention bonuses to personnel of the acquired business costs of contracted employees travel costs and certain other costs directly related to the integration of the acquisition 

depreciation amortization and accretion depreciation amortization and accretion charges relate to our property and equipment which consists primarily of towers associated buildings construction equipment and vehicles and other intangible assets depreciation of towers is generally computed with a useful life equal to the shorter of 20 years or the term of the underlying ground lease including optional renewal periods see note 1 to our consolidated financial statements amortization of other intangible assets the value of certain site rental contracts at ccusa is computed with a useful life of 10 to 20 years depreciation of buildings is generally computed with useful lives of 40 years depreciation of construction equipment and vehicles is generally computed with useful lives of 10 years and 5 years respectively 

discontinued operations on june 28 2004 we signed a definitive agreement to sell our uk subsidiary ccuk for over 2 billion to an affiliate of national grid on august 31 2004 we completed the sale of ccuk on may 9 2005 we sold opencell to a company in the business of developing and manufacturing wireless equipment including distributed antenna systems as part of the transaction we entered into a product procurement arrangement that permits us to continue the purchase of equipment for our distributed antenna activities for all periods presented the assets liabilities results of operations and cash flows of the businesses of ccuk and opencell are classified as amounts from discontinued operations 

  

the following information is derived from our historical consolidated statements of operations for the periods indicated 

comparison of years ended december 31 2006 and 2005—consolidated 

 

  percentage is not meaningful 

net revenues for 2006 increased by 1115 million or 165 from 2005 of this increase 1062 million or 953 was attributable to ccusa and 53 million or 47 was attributable to ccal the increase for 2006 resulted from an increase in site rental revenues of 996 million which represents 894 of the overall increase in net revenues the balance of the increase was related to network services and other revenues 

the increase in site rental revenue for 2006 was primarily driven by the following that occurred during or after 2005 1 new tenant additions or modifications to existing installations of 510 million 2 the leases as originally acquired related to the combined 941 towers from trintel and mountain union of 216 million and 3 an increase in noncash straightline rents of 163 million primarily relating to the renewal of certain leases as a result of our longterm five to 10 year contracts with our customers in any given year in excess of 90 of our site rental revenue excluding acquisitions is contracted for in a prior year and are of a recurring nature 

  

network services and other revenues for 2006 increased by 119 million or 149 from 2005 the increase in the network services and other revenues reflect both the demand by our tenants for space on our towers and the variable nature of the network services business as these revenues are typically not under longterm contract 

site rental gross margins site rental revenues less site rental costs of operations for 2006 increased by 845 million or 211 from 2005 site rental gross margins as percentage of site rental revenues increased by 26 percentage points to 695 for 2006 the incremental margin of 845 million represents 848 of the related increase in site rental revenues for 2006 the increase in the site rental gross margin percentage and the related high incremental margin percentage was driven by new tenant additions or modifications to existing installations on existing towers that did not result in significant incremental tower operating costs due to the relatively fixed nature of the costs to operate our towers 

general and administrative expenses for 2006 decreased by 96 million to 121 of total net revenue from 156 for 2005 general and administrative expenses for 2006 included stockbased compensation expense of 147 million which represents a decrease of 38 million from 2005 stockbased compensation expense decreased from 2005 primarily as a result of accelerated vesting of shares of restricted common stock during 2005 based on the performance of our stock see “ item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—results of operations—compensation charges related to restricted stock awards ” general and administrative expenses were also reduced via the consolidation of certain management functions in 2005 the decrease in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total net revenues is primarily a function of an increase in revenue without any significant increases in headcount as well as the decrease in stockbased compensation expense 

corporate development expenses for 2006 were 88 million an increase of 45 million from 43 million for 2005 this increase was primarily attributable to an increase in salary costs related to modeo within emerging businesses 

depreciation amortization and accretion for 2006 increased by 41 million or 15 from 2005 the increase was primarily attributable to the acquisition of the combined 941 trintel and mountain union towers by ccusa and an increase in our tower assets as a result of capital expenditures for both the modification to and maintenance on tower assets see “ item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — liquidity and capital resources—investing activities ” for a further discussion of our capital expenditures offset by the effects of the portfolio extension program that resulted in increases in the useful life of our towers resulting from the purchase of or extension of ground leases relating to the land on which our towers reside see “ item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—liquidity and capital resources—contractual cash obligations ” 

losses on the purchases and redemptions of debt for 2006 decreased by 2780 million from 2005 the decrease is primarily related to refinancing activities in 2005 that were completed to reduce our weighted average cost of debt and simplify our capital structure for 2005 the loss of 2838 million related to the purchase and redemption of 16 billion of our debt securities repaid with proceeds from the 2005 tower revenue notes 

interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs for 2006 increased by 285 million from 2005 the increase is primarily attributable to the approximately 12 billion increase in debt including the borrowings under the 2006 credit facility in june 2006 and the 2006 tower revenue notes offset by the refinancing of debt in june 2005 which reduced the weighted average coupon on our debt and the repayment of our previously outstanding credit facility entered into in july 2005 “2005 credit facility” 

our financing activities in 2005 and 2006 reflect 1 our focus to decrease our cost of debt and 2 our desire to position ourselves to have the financial flexibility to utilize our internally generated capital for investments which we believe satisfy our investment return criteria including opportunistic share purchases new assets and further investments in our existing assets see “ item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — liquidity and capital resources ” for further discussion 

minority interests primarily represent the minority shareholder’s 224 interest in the ccal operations 

  

income from discontinued operations of 57 million for 2006 relates primarily to the reversal of liabilities previously established in conjunction with the sale of our former ccuk operations as a result of the termination of related contingencies during 2006 income from discontinued operations for 2005 relates primarily to opencell which was sold on may 9 2005

the dividends on preferred stock in 2006 of 208 million are related to our 625 convertible preferred stock the decrease in the preferred stock dividends of 286 million from 2005 relates to the redemption of the 8 1  4  convertible preferred stock in december 2005 see note 10 to our consolidated financial statements 

comparison of years ended december 31 2006 and 2005—operating segments 

see note 16 to our consolidated financial statements for a tabular presentation of the financial results for our operating segments our reportable operating segments for 2006 are 1 ccusa 2 ccal 3 emerging businesses our modeo business and 4 corporate office and other our financial results are reported to management and the board of directors in this manner 

prior to january 1 2006 modeo and crown castle solutions were included in the segment emerging businesses effective january 1 2006 crown castle solutions became part of ccusa an operational change that reflects our belief that a das can be an alternative to traditional tower leasing in circumstances in which a tower or other structure is not available or cannot be built due to zoning or other impediments these changes in reportable segments were effective as of january 1 2006 and segment information for all periods presented has been reclassified 

our measurement of profit or loss currently used to evaluate our operating performance and operating segments is earnings before interest taxes depreciation amortization and accretion as adjusted “adjusted ebitda” our measure of adjusted ebitda may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies including companies in the tower sector and is not a measure of performance calculated in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” 

we define adjusted ebitda as net income loss plus restructuring charges credits asset writedown charges integration costs depreciation amortization and accretion losses on purchases and redemptions of debt interest and other income expense interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs benefit provision for income taxes minority interests cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle income loss from discontinued operations and stockbased compensation charges see note 12 to our consolidated financial statements the calculation of adjusted ebitda for our operating segments is set forth in note 16 to our consolidated financial statements adjusted ebitda is not intended as an alternative measure of operating results or cash flow from operations as determined in accordance with gaap and adjusted ebitda may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies adjusted ebitda is discussed further under “ item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — accounting and reporting matters—nongaap financial measures ” 

ccusa net revenues for 2006 increased by 1062 million or 171 from 2005 of the 1062 million increase in net revenues 944 million or 889 relates to site rental revenues this increase represents approximately 948 of the consolidated increase in site rental revenues for this same period network services revenues for 2006 increased by 118 million from 2005 network services revenues should continue to be somewhat volatile as these revenues unlike site rental revenues are typically not under longterm contract 

the increase in site rental revenue for 2006 was primarily driven by the following that occurred during or after 2005 1 new tenant additions or modifications to existing installations of 463 million 2 the leases as originally acquired related to the combined 941 towers acquired from trintel and mountain union of 216 million 

  

and 3 an increase in noncash straightline rents of 166 million primarily relating to the renewal of certain leases as mentioned previously in excess of 90 of our site rental revenue excluding acquisitions is of a recurring nature 

general and administrative expenses for 2006 decreased by 08 million to 88 of total net revenues from 104 of total net revenues for 2005 general and administrative expenses for 2006 included stockbased compensation expense of 56 million which represents a decrease of 19 million from 2005 noncash compensation charges decreased from 2005 primarily as a result of accelerated vesting of shares of restricted common stock during 2005 based on the performance of our stock see “ item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—results of operations—compensation charges related to restricted stock awards ” the decrease in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total net revenues is primarily a function of an increase in revenue without any significant increases in headcount as well as the decrease in stockbased compensation expense 

adjusted ebitda for 2006 increased by 842 million or 251 from 2005 adjusted ebitda was positively impacted by the high incremental margin from new tenant additions or modifications to existing installations on existing towers that did not result in significant incremental tower operating costs due to the relatively fixed nature of the costs to operate our towers more specifically site rental gross margins increased by 797 million or 215 to 699 of site rental revenues for 2006 from 3704 million or 674 of site rental revenues for 2005 the 797 million incremental margin represents 844 of the related increase in site rental revenues reflecting the relatively fixed nature of the costs to operate our towers 

operating income for 2006 increased by 810 million or 1148 from 2005 the increase in operating income was primarily driven by 1 the aforementioned 797 million increase in site rental gross margin and 2 the 62 million increase in network services and other gross margin which is a reflection of our customers’ continued demand for our installation services 

net income loss for 2006 was an unfavorable reduction of 85 million from 2005 the change from net income to net loss was primarily driven by incremental interest expense of 894 million as a result of our issuance of debt during 2005 and 2006 including the 2005 tower revenue notes 2006 tower revenue notes the 2005 credit facility and the 2006 credit facility see “ item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — liquidity and capital resources ” for further discussion partially offset by the 810 million increase in operating income 

ccal total net revenues for 2006 increased by 53 million or 97 from 2005 this increase is primarily driven by growth in site rental revenues which reflects tenant additions or modifications to existing installations on our towers and escalations on existing leases with variable escalations that occurred during or after 2005 our site rental revenues included a payment of 21 million for each of 2005 and 2006 related to a fee for the shortfall in a committed number of site licenses see “item 1 business—the company—ccal” 

adjusted ebitda for 2006 increased by 74 million or 336 from 2005 adjusted ebitda was positively impacted by the incremental margin from the new tenant additions or modifications to existing installations on existing towers and contractual escalations on existing leases with variable escalations more specifically site rental gross margins increased by 66 million or 222 to 691 of site rental revenues for 2006 from 298 million or 627 of site rental revenues for 2005 the 66 million incremental margin represents 1271 of the related increase in site rental revenues primarily reflecting an improvement in the costs to operate our ccal towers 

operating income loss for 2006 improved by 62 million from 2005 the change from operating loss to operating income is primarily due to the 66 million increase in gross margin from site rental revenues offset slightly by an increase in general and administrative expenses as a result of increased employee related costs including additional stockbased compensation expense as a result of both the modification of 1 crown castle australia pty ltd director and employee share option scheme “ccal share option scheme” to enable employees to require ccal to periodically settle vested shares and options in cash and 2 certain awards issued under the ccal share option scheme 

  

net loss for 2006 improved by 59 million from 2005 the improvement in net loss is primarily driven by the same factors that drove the improvement in operating income loss partially offset by the minority interest shareholder’s 224 portion of the results 

the increases and decreases between 2006 and 2005 are inclusive of exchange rate fluctuations exchange rates did not have a significant impact on the changes between these two periods see “ item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk ”

compensation charges related to restricted stock awards 

during 2003 2004 and 2005 we granted approximately 59 million 14 million and 08 million shares respectively of restricted common stock to our executives and certain employees including employees of the former ccuk these shares were to vest in various annual amounts over their respective service period ranging from four to five years with provision for accelerated vesting based on the market performance of our common stock in addition the 2005 shares awarded to executives contained an additional market performance target that had to be achieved in order for the shares to time vest if the award had not accelerated vested in connection with these restricted shares we were to recognize stockbased compensation charges over the vesting period for the awards granted in 2003 2004 and 2005 the weighted average grantdate per share fair value of the grants in 2003 2004 and 2005 was 421 1399 and 1676 respectively the market performance of our common stock reached the third and final target level for accelerated vesting on april 27 2004 for the awards granted in 2003 on september 16 2005 for the awards granted in 2004 and november 29 2005 for the awards granted in 2005 

a summary of accelerated vesting charges recorded in continuing operations by year for the restricted common stock granted in years 2003 to 2005 is as follows 

 

 we recognized combined stockbased compensation charges inclusive of the accelerated vesting charges in the above table from continuing operations of 126 million and 181 million in 2004 and 2005 respectively related to the restricted stock awards granted in 2003 2004 and 2005 see also note 12 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of these and other stockbased compensation awards 

in 2006 we granted 12 million shares of restricted stock to our executives and certain employees including 05 million retention awards 06 million performance awards and 01 million oneoff awards the awards have a 

  

weighted average requisite service period of approximately 25 years and a weighted average grantdate fair value per share of 2363 the performance restricted stock awards issued to certain employees contain provisions for accelerated vesting based on the market performance of our stock additionally the performance and retention awards for the executives contain an additional market performance target that must be achieved in order for any remaining unvested shares to vest after three to four years none of the 2006 awards have accelerated vested as of december 31 2006 we recognized stockbased compensation expense related to restricted stock awards of 123 million for 2006 the unrecognized compensation net of estimated forfeitures related to restricted stock awards at december 31 2006 is 154 million and is estimated to be recognized over a weighted average period of 17 years see note 12 to our consolidated financial statements

we believe stockbased compensation is an important part of our overall compensation strategy that promotes employee retention and aligns the employee’s compensation with our performance and the interests of our shareholders 

liquidity and capital resources 

overview 

strategy we seek to allocate our available capital among the investment alternatives that we believe exhibit sufficient potential to achieve acceptable riskadjusted returns or exhibit potential to complement our core tower rental business as such we may continue to 

 

  

  

 our goal is to maximize longterm net cash from operating activities and fund all nondiscretionary capital spending and debt service from our operating cash flow without reliance on additional borrowing or the use of our preexisting cash however due to risk factors including those set forth herein and in “ item 1a risk factors ” there can be no assurance that this will be possible as part of our strategy to achieve increases in net cash from operating activities in addition to improving operating results we have lowered interest rates on debt through attractive refinancing opportunities we may also incur additional indebtedness on a discretionary basis to fund discretionary investments 

our longterm business strategy contemplates discretionary capital expenditures in connection with the further improvement and selective expansion of our existing tower portfolios we expect that the majority of our discretionary investments will occur in connection with strategic tower acquisitions like the global signal merger in january 2007 purchases of common or preferred stock modifications and reinforcements of our existing towers for new tenant additions purchases of land under our towers selected new tower builds and to a lesser extent investments in adjacent businesses such as modeo we may incur additional indebtedness on a discretionary basis to fund these investments our longterm business strategy may be influenced over the near term as a result of the 

  

debt and equity financing of the global signal merger and the related commitment of time and expense to the execution of the integration of global signal’s business 

liquidity position as of december 31 2006 postmerger and after giving effect to the 2007 term loan and the january 2007 stock purchase we had consolidated cash and cash equivalents of 1394 million exclusive of restricted cash of 1375 million consolidated longterm and shortterm debt of 59455 million consolidated redeemable preferred stock of 3129 million and consolidated stockholders equity of 35333 million we also had 2500 million of availability under our 2007 revolver 

net cash from operations 

a summary of our net cash provided by operating activities from our consolidated statement of cash flows is as follows 

 

 the net cash provided by operating activities for 2006 increased by 708 million from 2005 due primarily to growth in our core site leasing and a decrease in cash interest paid changes in working capital and particularly changes in deferred rental revenues prepaid ground leases and accrued interest can have a dramatic impact on our net cash from operating activities for interim periods largely due to the timing of payments 

investing activities 

capital expenditures our capital expenditures can be separated into two general categories 

 

  

 a summary of our capital expenditures including the total capital expenditures which can be found on our consolidated statement of cash flows is as follows 

 

 for 2006 total capital expenditures increased 601 million or 930 from 2005 the increase in revenue generating capital expenditures is primarily driven by 

 

  

   

 our decisions regarding enhancement of towers the construction of new towers and das land purchases and investments in emerging businesses such as modeo are discretionary and depend upon expectations of achieving acceptable riskadjusted returns given current market conditions such decisions are influenced by the availability of capital and expected returns on alternative investments 

acquisition of mountain union on july 1 2006 we acquired approximately 98 of the outstanding equity interests of mountain union for approximately 305 million in january 2007 we acquired the remaining approximately 2 interest for 48 million we utilized borrowings under the 2006 credit facility to acquire the mountain union equity interests and pay off the outstanding indebtedness of mountain union mountain union’s assets at closing included 474 completed towers as well as 77 towers in various stages of development mountain union’s completed towers at closing are expected to produce approximately 26 million in annualized site rental revenue and approximately 182 million in annualized site rental gross margin we believe the acquisition of the towers from mountain union is consistent with our mission which is to deliver the highest level of service to our customers at all times – striving to be their critical partner as we assist them in growing efficient ubiquitous wireless networks we also believe acquiring these towers from mountain union is consistent with our strategy of increasing recurring revenue and cash flow we expect to incur minimal additional general and administrative expenses as a result of this acquisition the mountain union tower portfolio has concentrations in markets such as puerto rico los angeles denver phoenix and las vegas see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements

restricted cash  pursuant to the indenture agreement governing the 2005 tower revenue notes and 2006 tower revenue notes all rental cash receipts of the issuers of the 2005 tower revenue notes and 2006 tower revenue notes and their subsidiaries are restricted and held by the indenture trustee “indenture trustee” each month the monies in excess of required reserve balances are subsequently released to us on the 15 th calendar day following month end in addition all rental cash receipts of the entities who issued the 2004 mortgage loan and the 2006 mortgage loan are restricted and held in reserve the restricted cash related to the 2004 mortgage loan and 2006 mortgage loan is released to us when the amount exceeds preestablished funding levels 

contractual cash obligations 

the following table summarizes our contractual cash obligations as of december 31 2006 postmerger and after giving effect to the 2007 term loan 

 

            

  the following table summarizes the remaining terms to expiration including renewal terms at our option of the ground leases subleases or licenses for the land on which our ccusa towers reside as of december 31 2006 

 

 in addition to the towers discussed in the above table we also acquired 10749 towers through the global signal merger of which we lease sublease or license the land on which 8407 of these towers reside approximately 2 of the towers acquired through the global signal merger have a remaining term of less than one year 

portfolio extension program in 2004 we began the portfolio extension program through which we seek to 1 renegotiate and extend the terms of the ground leases subleases and licenses relating to the land on which our ccusa towers are located or 2 purchase the land on which such towers reside global signal had an ongoing initiative similar to our portfolio extension program which we expect to continue after the global signal merger see “ item 1a risk factors—we generally lease or sublease the land under our towers and may not be able to extend these leases ” 

factors affecting sources of liquidity 

the factors that are likely to determine our subsidiaries’ ability to comply with their current and future debt covenants are 

 

  

  

 given the current level of indebtedness of our subsidiaries the primary risk of a debt covenant violation would result from a deterioration of a subsidiary’s financial performance should a covenant violation occur in the future as a result of a shortfall in financial performance or for any other reason we might be required to make principal payments earlier than currently scheduled and may not have access to additional borrowings under these facilities as long as the covenant violation continues any such early principal payments would have to be made from our existing cash balances or cash from operations 

as a holding company ccic will require distributions or dividends from our subsidiaries or will be forced to use our remaining cash balances to fund the holding company’s debt obligations including the 4 convertible senior notes and the guarantee of the 2007 term loan and the 2007 revolver including interest payments on the notes the terms of the current indebtedness of our subsidiaries allow the ability to distribute cash to ccic unless they experience a deterioration of financial performance in addition there can be no assurance that our subsidiaries will generate sufficient cash from their operations to make any permitted distributions pursuant to our current or future indebtedness as a result we could be required to apply a portion of our remaining cash to fund interest 

  

payments on the notes if we do not retain sufficient funds or raise additional funds from any future financing we may not be able to make our interest payments on the notes 

our ability to make scheduled payments of principal of or to pay interest on our debt obligations and our ability to refinance any such debt obligations will depend on our future performance which to a certain extent is subject to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control see “item 1a risk factors ”

critical accounting policies 

the following is a discussion of the accounting policies that we believe 1 are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and 2 require our most difficult subjective or complex judgments often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 

revenue recognition site rental revenues are recognized on a monthly basis over the fixed noncancelable term of the relevant lease or agreement with terms generally ranging from five to 10 years in accordance with applicable accounting standards these revenues are recognized on a monthly basis regardless of whether the payments from the customer are received in equal monthly amounts if the payment terms call for fixed escalations as in fixed dollar or fixed percentage increases the effect of such increases is recognized on a straightline basis over the fixed noncancelable term of the agreement when calculating our straightline rental revenues we consider all fixed elements of tenant leases escalation provisions even if such escalation provisions also include a variable element as a result of this accounting method a portion of the revenue recognized in a given period represents cash collected in other periods for 2004 2005 and 2006 the noncash portion of our site rental revenues amounted to approximately 192 million 161 million and 205 million respectively see “ item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—results of operations—overview ” 

we provide network services such as antenna installations and subsequent augmentation network design and site selection site acquisition services site development and other services on a limited basis network services revenues are generally recognized under a method which approximates the completed contract method under the completed contract method revenues and costs for a particular project are recognized in total at the completion date when using the completed contract method of accounting for network services revenues we must accurately determine the completion date for the project in order to record the revenues and costs in the proper period for antenna installations we consider the project complete when the customer can begin transmitting its signal through the antenna we must also be able to estimate losses on uncompleted contracts as such losses must be recognized as soon as they are known the completed contract method is used for projects that require relatively short periods of time to complete generally less than one year such as our network services agreements and contracts we do not believe that our use of the completed contract method for network services projects produces financial position and operating results that differ substantially from the percentageofcompletion method 

some of our arrangements with our customers call for the performance of multiple revenuegenerating activities generally these arrangements include both site rental and network services in such cases we determine 

  

whether the multiple deliverables are to be accounted for separately or on a combined basis in order to be accounted for separately the undelivered items must 1 have standalone value to the customer 2 have reliably determinable fair value on a separate basis and 3 have delivery which is probable and under our control in addition the delivered item must have standalone value to the customer allocation of recognized revenue in such arrangements is based on the relative fair value of the separately delivered items we have generally determined that it is appropriate to account for antenna installation activities separately from the customer’s subsequent site rentals 

valuation of longlived assets we review the carrying values of property and equipment and other longlived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable if the sum of the estimated future cash flows undiscounted from the asset is less than its carrying amount an impairment loss is recognized measurement of an impairment loss is based on the fair value of the asset our determination that an adverse event or change in circumstance has occurred will generally involve 1 a deterioration in an asset’s financial performance compared to historical results 2 a shortfall in an asset’s financial performance compared to forecasted results or 3 a change in strategy affecting the utility of the asset our measurement of the fair value of an impaired asset will generally be based on an estimate of discounted future cash flows 

depreciation expense for our property and equipment is computed using the straightline method over the estimated useful lives of our various classes of assets the substantial portion of our property and equipment represents the cost of our towers which is depreciated with an estimated useful life equal to the shorter of 20 years or the term of the underlying ground lease including optional renewals see note 1 to our consolidated financial statements 

we test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis regardless of whether adverse events or changes in circumstances have occurred this annual impairment test involves 1 a step to identify potential impairment at a reporting unit level based on fair values and 2 a step to measure the amount of the impairment if any our measurement of the fair value for goodwill is based on an estimate of discounted future cash flows of the reporting unit the most important estimates for such calculations are the expected additions of new tenants on our towers the terminal multiple for our projected cash flows and our weighted average cost of capital 

during the fourth quarter of 2006 we performed our annual update of the impairment test for goodwill the results of this test indicated that goodwill was not impaired at any of our reporting units future declines in our site leasing business could result in an impairment of goodwill in the future if impairment were to occur in the future the calculations to measure the impairment could result in the writeoff of some portion to substantially all of our goodwill 

deferred income taxes we record deferred income tax assets and liabilities on our balance sheet related to events that impact our financial statements and tax returns in different periods in order to compute these deferred tax balances we first analyze the differences between the book basis and tax basis of our assets and liabilities referred to as “temporary differences” these temporary differences are then multiplied by current tax rates to arrive at the balances for the deferred income tax assets and liabilities a valuation allowance is provided on deferred tax assets if it is determined that it is more likely than not that the asset will not be realized 

the change in our net deferred income tax balances during a period results in a deferred income tax provision or benefit in our consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income loss if our expectations about the future tax consequences of past events should prove to be inaccurate the balances of our deferred income tax assets and liabilities could require significant adjustments in future periods such adjustments could cause a material effect on our results of operations for the period of the adjustment see notes 8 and 20 to our consolidated financial statements 

allowance for doubtful accounts receivable as part of our normal accounting procedures we must evaluate our outstanding accounts receivable to estimate whether they will be collected this is a subjective process that involves making judgments about our customers’ ability and willingness to pay these accounts an allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded as an offset to accounts receivable in order to present a net balance that we believe will be collected in estimating the appropriate balance for this allowance we consider 1 specific reserves for accounts we believe may prove to be uncollectible and 2 additional reserves based on historical collections for the remainder of our accounts additions to the allowance for doubtful accounts are charged to costs of operations and 

  

deductions from the allowance are recorded when specific accounts receivable are written off as uncollectible if our estimate of uncollectible accounts should prove to be inaccurate at some future date the results of operations for the period could be materially affected by any necessary correction to the allowance for doubtful accounts 

impact of recently issued accounting standards 

in december 2004 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued statement of financial accounting standards no 123 “sfas 123r” revised 2004 sharebased payment  sfas 123r requires that the cost resulting from all sharebased payment transactions be recognized in the financial statements based on fair value sfas 123r clarifies and expands sfas 123’s guidance in several areas including measuring fair value classifying an award as equity or as a liability and attributing compensation cost to reporting periods sfas 123r also requires that forfeitures of awards be estimated when granted while sfas 123 allowed forfeitures to be accounted for as they occur sfas 123r also requires additional disclosures about stockbased compensation awards we adopted the provisions of sfas 123r on january 1 2006 on january 1 2003 we adopted the fair value method of accounting for stockbased compensation using the prospective method of transition under statement of financial accounting standards no 148 “sfas 148” accounting for stockbased compensation – transition and disclosure  sfas 123r requires the use of a modified version of prospective application under which compensation cost is recognized on or after the required effective date for 1 awards granted modified repurchased or cancelled after that date and 2 the unvested portion of awards outstanding on that date based on their grantdate fair values in october and november 2005 and february 2006 the fasb released financial staff position “fsp” fsp 123r2 practical accommodation to the application of grant date as defined in fasb statement no 123r  fsp 123 r3 transition election related to accounting for the tax effects of sharebased payment awards and fsp 123 r4 classification of options and similar instruments issued as employee compensation that allow for cash settlement upon the occurrence of a contingent event  the fsp’s clarify certain accounting provisions set forth in sfas 123r the adoption of sfas 123r and the fsp’s increased our stockbased compensation charges by 05 million for 2006 see notes 1 and 12 to our consolidated financial statements 

in march 2005 the sec staff issued guidance on sfas 123r staff accounting bulletin no 107 “sab 107” was issued to assist preparers by simplifying some of the implementation challenges of sfas 123r while enhancing the information that investors receive sab 107 creates a framework that is premised on two overarching themes a considerable judgment will be required by preparers to successfully implement sfas 123r specifically when valuing employee stock options and b reasonable individuals acting in good faith may conclude differently on the fair value of employee stock options key topics covered by sab 107 include a valuation models—sab 107 reinforces the flexibility allowed by sfas 123r to choose an optionpricing model that meets the standard’s fair value measurement objective b expected volatility—sab 107 provides guidance on when it would be appropriate to rely exclusively on either historical or implied volatility in estimating expected volatility and c expected term—the new guidance includes examples and some simplified approaches to determining the expected term under certain circumstances we applied the principles of sab 107 in conjunction with our adoption of sfas 123r 

in march 2005 the fasb issued fin 47 which clarifies the term conditional asset retirement obligation as used in statement of financial accounting standards no 143 “sfas 143” accounting for asset retirement obligations  sfas 143 requires a liability to be recorded if the fair value of the obligation can be reasonably estimated the types of asset retirement obligations that are covered by fin 47 are those for which an entity has a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity but the timing and or method of settling the obligation are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity fin 47 also clarifies when an entity would have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation fin 47 is effective no later than fiscal years ending after december 15 2005 we adopted fin 47 on december 31 2005 the adoption of fin 47 resulted in the recognition of liabilities amounting to 140 million for contingent retirement obligations under certain tower site land leases asset retirement costs amounting to 49 million and the recognition of a charge for the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle amounting to 90 million at december 31 2005 and 2006 liabilities for contingent retirement obligations amounted to 167 million and 185 million respectively see notes 1 and 15 of our consolidated financial statements 

in july 2006 the fasb issued interpretation no 48 “fin 48” accounting for uncertainty in income taxes—an interpretation of fasb statement no 109  which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in tax positions we 

  

adopted fin 48 on january 1 2007 we expect to record an increase in retained earnings and a decrease in contingent tax liabilities through a cumulative effect adjustment of between approximately 40 million and 60 million upon adoption of fin 48 see note 8 of our consolidated financial statements 

in september 2006 the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 157 “sfas 157” fair value measurements  which defines fair value establishes a framework for measuring fair value in gaap and expands disclosures about fair value measurements sfas 157 is effective in the beginning of our 2008 fiscal year and the provisions will be applied prospectively we believe the impact of the adoption of sfas 157 will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

in september 2006 the sec staff issued sab 108 which provides interpretive guidance on how the effects of the carryover or reversal of prior year misstatements should be considered in quantifying a current year misstatement sab 108 requires the use of both the “iron curtain” and “rollover” approach in quantifying the materiality of misstatements sab 108 provides transitional guidance for the correction of errors in prior periods we adopted sab 108 as of september 30 2006 upon initial application of sab 108 we evaluated the uncorrected financial statement misstatements that were previously considered immaterial under the “rollover” approach using the dual methodology required by sab 108 as a result of this dual methodology approach of sab 108 we corrected the cumulative errors in our accounting for equitybased compensation for periods prior to january 1 2006 in accordance with the transitional guidance in sab 108 by recording a noncash offsetting cumulative effect adjustment of 840 million within stockholders’ equity that increased additional paidin capital and increased accumulated deficit these errors would not have affected our historical revenues adjusted ebitda or compliance with our debt covenants see notes 1 and 16 to our consolidated financial statements for a further discussion 

see note 1 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of recently issued accounting standards and the related impact on our consolidated financial statements 

nongaap financial measures 

our measurement of profit or loss currently used to evaluate the operating performance of our operating segments is earnings before interest taxes depreciation amortization and accretion as adjusted or adjusted ebitda our definition of adjusted ebitda is set forth in “ item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—results of operations—comparison of years ended december 31 2006 and 2005—operating segments ” our measure of adjusted ebitda may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies including companies in the tower sector and as used in the historical financial statements of global signal and is not a measure of performance calculated in accordance with gaap adjusted ebitda should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for operating income or loss net income or loss cash flows provided by used for operating investing and financing activities or other income statement or cash flow statement data prepared in accordance with gaap 

we believe adjusted ebitda is useful to an investor in evaluating our operating performance because 

 

  

  

  

  

   

our management uses adjusted ebitda 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 there are material limitations to using a measure such as adjusted ebitda including the difficulty associated with comparing results among more than one company and the inability to analyze certain significant items including depreciation and interest expense that directly affect our net income or loss management compensates for these limitations by considering the economic effect of the excluded expense items independently as well as in connection with their analysis of net income loss

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend as a result of our international operating investing and financing activities we are exposed to market risks which include changes in interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and equity security prices which may adversely affect our results of operations and financial position in attempting to minimize the risks or costs associated with such activities we seek to manage exposure to changes in interest rates where economically prudent to do so we do not currently hedge against foreign currency exchange risks or attempt to reduce our equity security price risk on our investment in fibertower 

interest rate risk 

certain of the financial instruments we have used to obtain capital are subject to market risks for fluctuations in market interest rates the majority of our financial instruments however are longterm fixed interest rate instruments as of december 31 2006 after giving consideration to the global signal merger and the 2007 term loan we had 6000 million of floating rate indebtedness or approximately 101 of total longterm debt as a result a hypothetical unfavorable fluctuation in market interest rates of one percentage point over a twelvemonth period would increase our interest expense by approximately 60 million 

we have used and may continue to use when we deem prudent interest rate swap agreements to manage and reduce our interest rate risk through the use of interest rate swap agreements we have effectively locked in the interest rate on the rollover of 1 19 billion 2005 tower revenue notes to june 2015 2 155 billion 2006 tower revenue notes to november 2016 3 155 billion 2006 mortgage loan to february 2016 and 4 2938 million 2004 mortgage loan to december 2014 see the tables below the forward starting interest rate swaps are exclusive of any credit spread that would be incremental to the interest rate of the anticipated financings 

during 2005 and 2006 we terminated certain interest rate swaps relating to the 2005 tower revenue notes and 2006 tower revenue notes respectively the effective interest rate on the 2005 tower revenue notes and 2006 tower revenue notes is approximately 495 and 583 respectively inclusive of an increase of approximately 006 and 012 respectively in the effective interest rate relating to interest rate swaps and exclusive of deferred financing costs see note 7 to our consolidated financial statements 

  

the following tables provide information about our market risk related to changes in interest rates the future minimum principal payment obligations and weighted average interest rates on our existing longterm debt are presented as of december 31 2006 postmerger and after giving effect to the 2007 term loan the forward starting interest rate swaps are presented as of december 31 2006 postmerger 

 

      

   foreign currency risk 

postmerger we conduct business in australia canada and united kingdom which exposes us to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates the majority of our foreign currency transactions are denominated in the australian dollar which is the functional currency of ccal as a result of ccal’s transactions being denominated and settled in such functional currencies the risks associated with currency fluctuations are primarily associated with foreign currency translation adjustments we do not currently hedge against foreign currency translation risks the average 

  

monthly exchange rate used to translate the 2005 financial statements for ccal fluctuated between a low of 07353 and a high of 07848 the average monthly exchange rate used to translate the 2006 financial statements for ccal fluctuated between a low of 07266 and a high of 07858 we do not currently believe our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates is material based on the immateriality of 1 the fair value of financial instruments subject to currency exchange risk and 2 the amount of the translation loss due to a hypothetical 10 unfavorable change in currency exchange rates that would be adjusted to accumulated other comprehensive income in february 2007 ccoc extended an undrawn commitment to provide a 4000 million australian dollar approximately 317 million us dollars revolving credit facility to ccal we anticipate that a portion of the credit facility may be drawn during the second quarter of 2007 which may increase our foreign currency risk in the future 

equity security price risk 

we are exposed to price fluctuations on our availableforsale investment in fibertower equity securities we do not currently attempt to reduce or eliminate the market exposure on these securities as of december 31 2006 a 20 hypothetical adverse change in the fibertower equity price would result in an approximate 310 million decrease in the fair value of our availableforsale equity investments with an offsetting adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income subject to the required evaluation of impairment charges relating to a decline in value that is determined to be otherthantemporary see note 6 to our consolidated financial statements and “item 1a risk factors”

c changes in internal control over financial reporting 

there have not been any changes in the company’s internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in rules 13a15f and 15d15f of the exchange act during the most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting 

subsequent to december 31 2006 as discussed in item 1 of this annual report under the caption “business” and in note 20 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report the company completed the global signal merger on january 12 2007 the assets revenues and results of operations of global signal will be material to the company’s financial position cash flows and results of operations and the company is in the process of integrating global signal’s operations into our internal control structure as of december 31 2005 global signal concluded that their system of internal control over financial reporting was not effective global signal had control deficiencies that they concluded were material weaknesses in both the design and operating effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting including the lack of adequate control over the accuracy of automated computations related to accounting for noncash aspects of tenant and ground leases and the data used in these computations based on discussions with the former global signal management and due diligence performed related to the global signal merger the aforementioned material weaknesses were not remediated during 2006 the company is diligently pursuing remediation of these material weaknesses during the integration of the global signal business during 2007 there can be no assurances that the company will be able to remediate these material weaknesses 

d limitations on the effectiveness of controls 

all internal control systems no matter how well designed have inherent limitations therefore even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation because of its inherent limitations our internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements in addition projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies and procedures may deteriorate

we began 2003 with two joint ventures with verizon crown atlantic and the crown castle gt joint venture “crown castle gt” crown atlantic was formed in 1998 with bell atlantic mobile now held by verizon and crown castle gt was formed in 1999 with gte wireless at the time of these transactions these towers represented substantially all the towers used in such carriers’ 850 mhz wireless networks in the eastern midwestern southwestern and pacific coast areas of the us and currently provide coverage for 22 of the top 50 us metropolitan areas including new york chicago houston washington dc philadelphia boston phoenix and san francisco 

  

effective may 1 2003 we entered into several agreements relating to crown atlantic and crown castle gt under these agreements certain termination rights under which verizon could have required us to purchase its interest in crown atlantic at any time payable in cash or common stock at our option were converted to put and call rights payable in cash only with an extended exercise date of july 1 2007 we also acquired all of verizon’s ownership interest in crown castle gt subject to certain protective rights retained by verizon in exchange for verizon acquiring additional interests in crown atlantic and certain other consideration in addition the shares of our common stock previously held by the ventures were distributed to a verizon affiliate and subsequently sold to third parties following the transactions we own 100 of crown castle gt and 628 of crown atlantic with verizon owning the remaining 372 as of december 31 2003 crown atlantic had 2024 sites and our crown castle gt subsidiaries had 2930 sites 

  

through the bellsouth mobility and bellsouth dcs both now part of cingular transactions which were substantially completed in september 2000 we have approximately 3050 towers including towers built pursuant to buildtosuit agreements these towers represented 1 substantially all of the towers in bellsouth mobility’s 850 mhz wireless network in the southeastern and midwestern united states providing coverage for 12 of the top 50 us metropolitan areas including miami atlanta tampa nashville and indianapolis and 2 substantially all of the towers in bellsouth dcs’s 19 ghz wireless network in north carolina south carolina east tennessee and parts of georgia 

  

through the powertel acquisition which closed in june 1999 we have approximately 675 towers these towers represented substantially all of the towers owned by powertel now a part of tmobile in its 19 ghz wireless network in the southeastern and midwestern united states approximately 90 of these towers are in seven southeastern states providing coverage for such metropolitan areas as atlanta birmingham jacksonville memphis and louisville and a number of major connecting highway corridors in the southeast 

  

we plan to continue to structurally enhance our existing towers and selectively build or acquire strategically located towers which meet certain economic criteria on a limited basis to reduce risk and speculation in connection with building towers we generally look for sites with multiple tenant demand and obtain lease commitments from wireless carriers prior to building such towers further the towers are constructed to accommodate multiple tenants in order to obviate the need for later structural enhancement saving capital and time for carriers 

  

site rental 

  

in the us we rent antenna space on our towers to a variety of carriers operating cellular personal communication services specialized mobile radio enhanced specialized mobile radio broadband data services paging and other networks 

  

we generally receive monthly rental payments from customers payable under site leases and we also receive fees for managing the installation of customers’ equipment and antennas on certain of our sites in the us the new leases typically entered into by us have original terms of five years with three or four optional renewal periods of five years each and provide for annual price increases based primarily on a consumer price index subject to certain conditions the lease agreements relating to tower network acquisitions generally have a base term of 10 years with multiple renewal options each typically ranging from five to ten years we have existing master lease agreements with most major wireless carriers including verizon wireless cingular tmobile nextel sprint pcs and att wireless which provide certain terms including economic terms that govern leases on our towers entered into by such parties during the term of their master lease agreements 

  

the average monthly rental payment of a new tenant added to a tower varies among the different regions in the us and the type of service being provided by the tenant with broadband tenants such as personal communications services paying more than narrowband tenants such as paging primarily as a result of the physical size of the antenna installation in addition we also routinely receive rental payment increases in connection with lease amendments which authorize carriers to add additional antennas or other equipment to sites on which they already have equipment pursuant to preexisting lease agreements 

  

network services 

  

historically we have provided network services such as antenna installations network design and site selection site acquisition site development and other services however during 2003 we continued to implement our strategic decision begun in 2002 to reduce our service offerings to primarily the management of antenna installations on our sites although network services revenues declined by 879 million in 2003 as compared to 2002 network services margins declined by only 120 million during that same period 

  

our strategic decision to deemphasize our network services offerings in the us was made primarily as a result of the fact that such activities are typically nonrecurring and highly competitive with a number of local competitors in most markets we now generally provide such services only when important to a customer relationship we expect network services revenues to continue to decline as a percentage of total revenue in the foreseeable future 

  

customers 

  

in both our us site rental and network services businesses we work with a number of customers in a variety of businesses including cellular personal communications services enhanced specialized mobile radio broadband data services and paging we work primarily with large national wireless carriers such as verizon wireless cingular tmobile nextel sprint pcs and att wireless for the year ended december 31 2003 these six carriers accounted for approximately 690 of our 2003 us revenues and 383 of our 2003 consolidated revenues with verizon wireless accounting for 246 of our us revenues and 137 of our consolidated revenues in addition combined revenues received from tmobile through our us and uk operations accounted for 101 of our consolidated revenues no other single customer in the us accounted for more than 100 of our 2003 consolidated revenues 

  

sales and marketing 

  

our us sales organization markets our towers within the wireless telecommunications industry we use public and proprietary databases to develop targeted marketing programs focused on carrier network buildouts modifications site additions and network services information about carriers’ existing sites licenses marketing strategies capital spend plans deployment status and actual signal strength measurements taken in the field is analyzed to match specific towers in our portfolios with potential new site demand in addition we have developed proprietary property management tools and software which allow us to determine colocatability with greater speed and accuracy through these and other tools we have developed we seek to determine “potential demand” for our towers and other sites allowing for proactive discussions with our carrier customers regarding these sites and the timing of their demand 

  

a team of national account directors maintains our relationships with our largest customers these directors work to develop new site leasing opportunities network services contracts and site management opportunities as well as to ensure that customers’ emerging needs are translated into new products and services this group also supports third party project management arrangements to provide network deployments 

  

sales personnel in our regional offices develop and maintain local relationships with carriers that are expanding their networks entering new markets bringing new technologies to market or requiring maintenance or addon business we target numerous types of wireless carriers including cellular personal communications services enhanced specialized mobile radio wireless data broadband data paging and government agencies our objective is to lease space on existing towers and presell capacity on our new towers prior to construction 

  

in addition to our fulltime sales and marketing staff a number of senior managers and executive officers spend a significant portion of their time on sales and marketing activities and call on existing and prospective customers 

  

competition 

  

in the us we compete with other independent tower owners which also provide site rental and network services wireless carriers which own and operate their own tower networks broadcasters and building owners that lease antenna space primarily on colocatable rooftop sites and other potential competitors such as utilities and 

  

outdoor advertisers some of which have already entered the site rental industry wireless carriers that own and operate their own tower networks generally are substantially larger and have greater financial resources than we have we believe that tower location capacity quality of service deployment speed and price have been and will continue to be the most significant competitive factors affecting the leasing of a site 

  

the following is a list of some of the larger independent tower companies with which we compete in the us spectrasite american tower sba communications aat communications and global signal we also compete with sprint sites usa a division of sprint that markets and manages sprint’s sites and towers significant additional site rental competition comes from the leasing of rooftops utility structures and other alternative sites for antennas 

  

competitors in the network services business include bechtel general dynamics lucent black  veatch wireless facilities inc sba communications and tetra tech we also participate with these entities to deliver network development services to our customers commencing in 2002 we made a strategic decision to reduce our service offerings to primarily the management of antenna installations on our sites we believe that carriers base their decisions on the outsourcing of network services on criteria such as a company’s experience track record local reputation price and time for completion of a project 

  

uk operations 

  

overview 

  

our two primary businesses in the uk conducted through our whollyowned subsidiary ccuk are the leasing of antenna space on our sites to wireless carriers and the operation of shared analog and digital television and radio broadcast transmission networks complementing our site rental business we also offer certain network services primarily consisting of antenna installation services for the year ended december 31 2003 the site rental business accounted for 396 of ccuk’s revenues and the broadcast transmission business accounted for 417 of ccuk’s revenues 

  

through our uk site rental business we lease antenna space on our sites we generally receive annual rental payments from customers under site rental licenses that are typically for a term of 10 to 20 years with rent review every one to three years we also receive fees for the network services we provide to certain of our site rental customers our primary uk site rental customers are the larger uk wireless carriers—including 3 tmobile o 2  orange and vodafone—and airwave which provides wireless communications for emergency services see “business—the company—uk operations—site rental” 

  

through our uk transmission business we own and operate one of the most established shared broadcast television and radio transmission networks which we initially acquired in february 1997 through the privatization of the bbc’s transmission operations and infrastructure our uk broadcast transmission business provides analog and digital terrestrial transmission and related services under longterm contracts for television and radio programs produced by the bbc and other content providers the bbc is our largest uk transmission business customer accounting for approximately 322 of ccuk’s revenues for the year ended december 31 2003 

  

in 2002 as part of our broadcast transmission business ccuk was granted operator licenses with respect to two dtt multiplexes in the uk and on october 30 2002 ccuk together with the bbc and bskyb launched a multichannel dtt broadcasting service under the brand “freeview” in connection with freeview we have secured longterm contracts to provide dtt transmission services to the bbc and multiplexing and transmission services to bskyb uktv flextech television viacom emap mietv and others see “business—the company—uk operations—transmission business” and “—significant contracts” 

  

as of december 31 2003 we owned or managed 3487 towers rooftops and other sites throughout the uk including england wales scotland and northern ireland a substantial number of these sites were acquired or developed through 1 our 1997 acquisition of the bbc’s broadcast and tower infrastructure 2 our march 1999 site acquisition and development transaction with one 2 one now part of tmobile and 3 our bt site agreement 

  

as further described below we expect to expand our uk portfolio by developing additional sites we anticipate that most of these new sites will be developed on bt sites under our amended site agreement with bt 

  

the acquisition of the bbc transmission network provided a valuable initial portfolio of approximately 730 towers for site rental through the one 2 one transaction ccuk added approximately 1670 towers including towers built pursuant to a buildtosuit agreement with tmobile to its portfolio these towers represented substantially all of tmobile’s towers in its nationwide wireless network in the uk at the time of the acquisition 

  

in november 2000 ccuk entered into an agreement with bt to lease space on as many as 4000 bt sites principally rooftop facilities throughout the uk in september 2003 ccuk reached agreement to amend certain provisions of its agreements with bt the revised agreements allow ccuk to continue to exclusively develop bt exchange sites through october 2013 provided we have developed at least 2000 bt exchange sites by december 2006 see “business—the company—uk operations—significant contracts—bt site agreement” 

  

our broadcast transmission network reaches substantially all of the uk population and consists of approximately 1300 sites more than half of which are on our sites and the balance of which are licensed to us under sitesharing agreements with ntl or other third party site operators 

  

site rental 

  

through our uk site rental business we lease antenna space on our sites to a variety of wireless carriers including customers providing cellulargsm broadband data 3g pmrtetra and other services ccuk’s largest by revenue site rental customers include the larger uk wireless carriers—such as 3 tmobile o 2  orange and vodafone—and airwave which provides wireless communications for emergency services in recent years revenues from our uk site rental business have become an increasing portion of ccuk’s total revenues 

  

we generally receive annual rental payments according to rate schedules based on antenna size and position on the site from customers payable under site rental licenses and we may also receive fees for the network services we provide our site rental customers such as managing the installation of our customers’ equipment and antennas on certain of our sites the uk site rental agreements typically have a term of 10 to 20 years with rent reviews every one to three years 

  

we have master licensing agreements with most of the major wireless carriers in the uk including 3 tmobile o 2  orange and vodafone these agreements provide certain terms including economic terms that govern licenses on our sites entered into by such parties during the term of their master licensing agreements 

  

in addition to our wireless carrier site rental customers ntl leases space on our towers under the ntl sitesharing agreement and the digital broadcasting site sharing agreement these site sharing agreements relate to the reciprocal use of sites for the respective broadcast contracts of ccuk and ntl and are not representative of the typical wireless colocation tenant revenues received by ccuk under these ntl agreements with respect to space rented by ntl on ccuk sites are substantially offset by payments made to ntl with respect to space rented by ccuk on ntl sites the ntl sitesharing agreement may be terminated on december 31 2015 provided notice of termination is delivered on or prior to december 31 2010 see “business—the company—uk operations—significant contracts—ntl sitesharing agreement” 

  

in april 2000 the uk auctioned five licenses relating to 3g mobile communications 3 tmobile o 2  orange and vodafone currently hold the 3g licenses acquired through these auctions during 2003 3 launched its 3g service in the uk in february 2004 vodafone launched its 3g laptop computer datacard service in london and announced plans to reach 30 of the uk population by april 2004 in february 2004 orange and tmobile announced plans to launch 3g services in 2004 we are working with each of the 3g license holders in the uk in order to provide them space on our sites as they deploy 3g services 

  

transmission business 

  

our uk broadcast transmission business provides transmission and related services for analog and digital television and analog and digital radio 

  

analog television at the time the bbc transmission network was acquired in 1997 we entered into a 10year analog transmission contract with the bbc under the bbc analog transmission contract we provide analog terrestrial transmission services for the bbc’s analog television programs on two bbc channels and certain other related services for the year ended december 31 2003 ccuk generated approximately 105 of its revenues from the provision of analog television broadcast transmission services to the bbc see “business—the company—uk operations—significant contracts—bbc analog transmission contract” 

  

the bbc analog transmission contract may be terminated on any march 31 commencing with march 31 2007 following 12 months’ prior notice by either ccuk or the bbc it is contemplated that the bbc analog transmission contract will continue beyond 2007 and be amended in some manner however there can be no assurances that any continuation or modification will occur in addition it is also contemplated that any continuation beyond 2007 of this contract may contain different terms with respect to analog broadcast services as the uk government proceeds with its previously stated intention to phase switchover in the uk from analog television to digital television services 

  

we own the transmitter equipment used for the analog broadcast of the bbc’s domestic television programs within the uk whether located on one of ccuk’s sites on an ntl site through a site sharing agreement that provides us with reciprocal access rights to ntl’s broadcast transmission sites or other thirdparty site as of december 31 2003 ccuk had approximately 2240 analog transmitters for analog television broadcasting 

  

a few of our most powerful analog television transmitters together cover the majority of the uk population this is illustrated by the fact that one of our analog television transmitter sites at crystal palace london provides coverage to 20 of the uk population and the top 16 analog transmitter sites provide coverage to 79 of the uk population 

  

analog radio under the bbc analog transmission contract we also provide analog terrestrial transmission services for the bbc’s analog radio programs and certain other related services including with respect to uk nationwide bbc radio services regional bbc radio services for scotland wales and northern ireland and local bbc radio stations for the year ended december 31 2003 ccuk generated approximately 118 of its revenues from the provision of analog radio broadcast transmission services to the bbc 

  

the bbc analog transmission contract may be terminated on any march 31 commencing with march 31 2007 following 12 months’ prior notice by either ccuk or the bbc it is contemplated that the bbc analog transmission contract will continue beyond 2007 and be amended in some manner however there can be no assurances that any continuation or modification will occur see “business—the company—uk operations—significant contracts—bbc analog transmission contract” 

  

in addition to the bbc analog transmission contract we have separate contracts to provide analog transmission services and maintenance for two uk national commercial radio stations virgin radio and talksport formerly talk radio in july 2001 the virgin radio analog contract was renewed for a period expiring april 30 2008 the talksport analog contract commenced on february 4 1995 and expires on december 31 2008 

  

as with our analog television services we own the transmitter equipment used in the analog broadcast for our analog radio transmission customers in the uk whether located on one of ccuk’s sites or on an ntl or other thirdparty site as of december 31 2003 ccuk had approximately 1300 analog transmitters for analog radio broadcasting 

  

digital terrestrial television in 1998 the uk government established and licensed six multiplexes each capable of providing a number of television channels for dtt service in the uk in 1998 ccuk entered into 12year contracts with the bbc and itv digital “itvd” to build and operate the dtt transmission network for the one multiplex licensed to the bbc multiplex 1 and the three multiplexes licensed to itvd multiplex b c and d in january 2000 we completed the rollout of the 80 station network required under these contracts of these sites 49 are on ccuk sites and the remainder are on ntl towers pursuant to a site sharing arrangement 

  

in april 2002 itvd announced plans to liquidate and returned its multiplex licenses to the independent television commission “itc” prior to the liquidation ccuk had earned gross revenues of approximately £194 

  

million 276 million at such time annually under its transmission contract with itvd itvd represented approximately 12 of the 2001 revenues of ccuk and approximately 3 of the 2001 consolidated revenues of the company 

  

in august 2002 the itc granted the dtt multiplex licenses previously held by itvd to ccuk multiplex c and d and the bbc multiplex b bringing the bbc’s total to two licenses the dtt multiplex licenses awarded to ccuk have a term of 12 years and ccuk has the right to renew the licenses for an additional term of 12 years subject to satisfaction of certain performance criteria no license fees were paid to the uk government with respect to the award of the multiplex licenses other than an approximately 76000 application fee following the award of such licenses the current uk dtt multiplex licensing structure is as follows 

  

    

on october 30 2002 the bbc ccuk and bskyb launched a multichannel digital tv and radio broadcasting service under the brand “freeview” freeview is a freetoair broadcast service and is received by viewers via a settop box or other device at the end of 2003 there were approximately three million such devices in service in contrast to the approximately 12 million settop boxes in service with respect to itvd service 20 months prior our revenue derived from broadcast transmission services including distribution and multiplexing relating to freeview is contractually based and therefore is not directly dependent on the number of freeview viewers 

  

in connection with the launch of freeview in august 2002 ccuk entered into an agreement with the bbc to provide broadcast transmission along with distribution service for the second multiplex license multiplex b awarded to the bbc also in august 2002 ccuk entered into an agreement with bskyb to provide broadcast transmission along with distribution and multiplexing service in relation to 75 of the capacity of one of the ccuk multiplexes multiplex c both of these agreements are for an initial period of six years with options for the bbc and bskyb to extend for an additional sixyear term in addition ccuk has entered into agreements to provide similar service to a number of tv radio and interactive service content providers including uktv flextech viacom emap mietv oneword guardian media group and bbc world service through the two multiplexes awarded to ccuk freeview related agreements with the television content providers are also for sixyear terms with renewal options while agreements with radio and interactive service providers are generally for shorter terms 

  

through such agreements ccuk is currently transmitting content for such customers with respect to approximately 90 of its licensed capacity and is negotiating with content providers with respect to the remaining capacity ccuk has contracted annual revenues of approximately £272 million 485 million for the provision of transmission distribution and multiplexing services related to its multiplex licenses which replaces the approximately £194 million annual revenues previously earned from the itvd contract and is in addition to the revenues generated from the 1998 bbc digital transmission contract see “business—the company—uk operations—significant contracts—1998 bbc dtt transmission contract” “—2002 bbc dtt transmission contract” and “—bskyb and other freeview content dtt transmission contracts” 

  

as a result of its previous contract with itvd ccuk had already invested substantially all of the capital required to provide the freeview related broadcast transmission service described above in addition ccuk had previously been incurring again by virtue of its previous contract with itvd a large proportion of the operating costs required to provide these services including payments to bt for distribution circuits and payments to ntl for site rental since ccuk is providing a more complete endtoend service to content providers than was provided to itvd ccuk is incurring certain additional annual operating costs of approximately £46 million 82 million 

  

including 1 payments to bbc’s technology division for multiplexing services and 2 payments to digital tv services ltd a costsharing cooperative in which ccuk the bbc and bskyb are equal shareholders for promotion and marketing of freeview 

  

digital radio we currently provide transmission services for digital radio or digital audio broadcasts “dab” in the uk in 1995 the bbc launched over our transmission network its initial national dab service in march 2003 we entered into a new contract with an initial term expiring september 2016 for uk distribution of the dab program feed from the bbc’s studios plus the provision of an additional 47 transmitter sites the full implementation of this contract is expected to extend the bbc’s dab coverage to over 80 of the uk population see “business—the company—uk operations—significant contracts—2003 bbc dab transmission contract” 

  

in addition to dab facilities that we operate for the bbc on july 14 2000 we were awarded a 12year contract with switchdigital london limited to provide their london local digital radio network service since that date ccuk has been awarded two additional 12year contracts with switchdigital to provide similar digital radio network service to two areas of scotland in november 2003 we signed a 12year agreement with a partnership consisting of the wireless group twg and emap to provide dab transmission services to stoke on trent located in central england site sharing for other dab multiplexes provides additional revenues at several other transmission sites 

  

network services 

  

ccuk provides broadcast and telecommunications network services to various customers in the uk we have engineering and technical staff capable of meeting the requirements of our current customer base and the challenges of developing digital technology within the uk ccuk has worked with several telecommunications operators on design and build projects as they deploy their networks 

  

antenna installation and site development one of the services that ccuk provides is site design and antenna installation activity for wireless infrastructure ccuk’s operations division provides program and project management through its delivery teams using project management tools and software the majority of construction activities are completed through independent contractors experienced in the wireless telecommunications construction industry operations are located in three regional offices across the uk providing a nationwide service to our customers 

  

network design and site selection in december 1999 ccuk and tmobile entered into an agreement under which ccuk would establish a turnkey mobile network for tmobile in northern ireland in april 2001 ccuk launched the network which now covers substantially all of the population of northern ireland ccuk provides cell planning acquisition design build operation and maintenance services related to the network including ownership of the antenna provisioning of backhaul and signal monitoring in september 2003 ccuk signed an agreement with esat bt bt’s republic of ireland subsidiary to provide program management support services and 3g radio frequency cell planning and network optimization services to esat bt in relation to their contract with hutchison 3g ireland to rollout a turnkey 3g mobile network in the republic of ireland 

  

significant contracts 

  

ccuk’s principal analog broadcast transmission contract is the bbc analog transmission contract ccuk also has entered into dtt and dab contracts with the bbc in connection with freeview ccuk has entered into transmission and multiplexing contracts with bskyb and various other broadcasters under the sitesharing agreement ccuk also gives ntl access to facilities to provide broadcast transmission to nonccuk customers ccuk also has longterm service agreements with radio broadcast customers such as virgin radio talksport emap and switchdigital plus a number of smaller radio broadcasters in addition ccuk has several agreements with telecommunication providers including leases site management contracts and independent contractor agreements ccuk has also entered into contracts to design and build infrastructure for customers such as 3 tmobile o 2  orange airwave and vodafone 

  

bbc analog transmission contract ccuk entered into a transmission contract with the bbc for the provision of terrestrial analog television and analog and digital radio transmission services in the uk at the time the bbc transmission business was acquired the bbc analog transmission contract also provides for ccuk to be liable to the bbc for “service credits” ie rebates of its charges in the event that certain standards of service are not attained as a result of what the contract characterizes as “accountable faults” or the failure to meet certain “response times” in relation to making repairs at certain key sites ccuk has met the bbc’s service requirements and to date has paid no service credit penalties 

  

the contract may be terminated on any march 31 commencing with march 31 2007 following 12 months prior notice by either ccuk or the bbc it is contemplated that the bbc analog transmission contract will continue beyond 2007 and be amended in some manner however there can be no assurances that any such continuation or modifications will occur in addition it is also contemplated that any continuation beyond 2007 of this agreement may contain different terms with respect to analog broadcast services as the uk government proceeds with its previously stated intention to phase switchover in the uk from analog television to digital television services 

  

1998 bbc dtt transmission contract in 1998 we entered into a 12year contract with the bbc to build and operate the dtt transmission network for its first multiplex the contract has a current expiration date of october 31 2010 

  

2002 bbc dtt transmission contract following the award of the dtt licenses in 2002 and in connection with the launch of freeview in august 2002 ccuk entered into an agreement with the bbc to provide transmission along with distribution service for the new dtt multiplex licensed to the bbc this agreement commenced on october 30 2002 and has an initial term of six years with an option by the bbc to renew for an additional sixyear term

bt digital distribution contract under the bbc and freeview related digital transmission contracts including the contracts described above in addition to providing dtt transmission services ccuk has agreed to provide for the distribution of the bbc and freeview related broadcast signals from their respective television studios to ccuk’s transmission network in may 1998 ccuk entered into a 12year distribution contract with bt in which bt has agreed to provide fully duplicated primarily fiberbased digital distribution services this contract is now being used to provide program distribution services for freeview content providers and has been amended to expire contemporaneously with our dtt multiplex licenses in 2014 with provisions for extending the term 

  

2003 bbc dab transmission contract  in march 2003 we were awarded a new contract with the bbc for uk distribution of the dab program services from the bbc plus the provision of an additional 47 transmitters to be added to the existing 31 transmitters the contract has an initial term expiring in september 2016 with an option for the bbc to extend the term for an additional 12 years the full implementation of this contract is expected to extend the bbc’s dab coverage to over 80 of the uk population 

  

ntl sitesharing agreement in order to optimize service coverage for television and radio services and to enable viewers to receive all analog uhf television services using one receiving antenna the bbc as the predecessor to ccuk and ntl made arrangements to share certain broadcast sites this arrangement was introduced in the 1960s when uhf television broadcasting began in the uk in addition to service coverage advantages the arrangement also minimizes costs and avoids the difficulties of obtaining additional sites 

  

on september 10 1991 the bbc and ntl entered into the sitesharing agreement which set out the commercial site sharing terms under which the parties were entitled to use each other’s sites for television and radio services for a commercial license fee in accordance with the agreement’s rate schedule the party using the other party’s site is responsible in normal circumstances for the costs of accommodation and equipment used exclusively 

  

by it the sitesharing agreement may be terminated on december 31 2015 provided notice of termination is delivered on or prior to december 31 2010 it may also be terminated upon a material breach bankruptcy or insolvency of a party and cessation of a broadcast transmission business or function 

  

similar site sharing arrangements have been entered into between ntl and us for the buildout of digital transmission sites and equipment including a supplementary fee schedule related to site sharing fees for new digital facilities and revised operating and maintenance procedures related to digital equipment 

  

revenues received by ccuk under these ntl agreements with respect to space rented by ntl on ccuk owned sites are substantially offset by payments made to ntl with respect to space rented by ccuk on ntl owned sites 

  

tmobile northern ireland network in december 1999 ccuk and tmobile entered into an agreement under which ccuk would establish a turnkey mobile network for tmobile in northern ireland in april 2001 ccuk launched the network which now covers substantially all of the population of northern ireland ccuk provides cell planning acquisition design build operation and maintenance services related to the network including ownership of the antenna provisioning of backhaul and signal monitoring tmobile provides the base stations and holds the spectrum license the agreement with tmobile is for an initial term of 11 years we currently have approximately 200 tower sites in northern ireland and tmobile is a tenant on substantially all of these sites 

  

bt site agreement in november 2000 ccuk entered into an agreement with bt to lease space on as many as 4000 bt sites principally rooftop exchange sites throughout the uk we originally contracted to pay an aggregate of £150 million in installments for site access on the first 1500 sites from the bt site portfolio but in september 2003 the final payment was reduced by approximately £288 million approximately 479 million and the agreement amended as described below 

  

in march 2003 ccuk paid £212 million approximately 332 million of the final £500 million site access fee payment due to bt relating to the bt site agreement as previously amended in september 2003 ccuk reached agreement to amend certain provisions of its agreements with bt under the terms of the amended agreements with bt ccuk will not be required to make any further site access payments to bt with respect to the bt sites the revised agreements allow ccuk to continue to exclusively develop bt sites through october 2013 provided we have developed at least 2000 bt sites by december 2006 under the amended agreement bt funds the common area capital expenditures required to develop the sites and ccuk receives 40 of the revenue of all colocated tenants on the sites developed no revisions were made to the financial arrangements associated with the bt sites drawn for development prior to october 1 2003 pursuant to which ccuk receives 65 of tenant revenue derived from such sites 

  

we are developing the bt site portfolio for the deployment of wireless services including second generation and 3g services as of december 31 2003 we had developed 738 sites under this agreement 

  

3 agreement in february 2001 ccuk signed an agreement with 3 whereby 3 would lease space on ccuk sites throughout the uk in september 2003 ccuk reached agreement to amend certain provisions of its agreements with 3 under terms of the amended agreements with 3 ccuk has received a commitment from 3 to colocate on 1350 ccuk sites effective january 1 2003 as part of the amended agreements 3 agreed to pay an additional approximately 134 million in net present value through december 31 2004 to secure access to the additional sites as 3 locates its equipment on ccuk sites 3 will pay site rental revenue to ccuk based on the configuration of the 3 equipment installed ccuk will continue to remain as 3’s preferred site provider in the uk 

  

o 2 agreement in february 2001 ccuk signed an agreement with its existing customer o 2 pursuant to which o 2 would lease additional space on ccuk sites throughout the uk in november 2003 ccuk and o 2 modified and clarified the arrangements with o 2  the modifications address pricing payments process and other arrangements for the future deployment on ccuk sites 

  

customers 

  

in our uk site rental and network services businesses we work with a number of customers in a variety of businesses including cellulargsm broadband data 3g and pmrtetra we work primarily with the five largest 

  

uk personal communications networkcellular operators—3 tmobile o 2  orange and vodafone—and airwave which provides wireless communications for emergency services for the year ended december 31 2003 these six customers together accounted for approximately 438 of ccuk’s revenues and 180 of our consolidated revenues 

  

the bbc is our largest broadcast transmission business customer accounting for approximately 322 of ccuk’s revenues and 132 of our consolidated revenues for the year ended december 31 2003 in addition combined revenues received from tmobile through our us and uk operations accounted for 101 of our consolidated revenues no other single customer in the uk accounted for more than 10 of our consolidated revenues 

  

sales and marketing 

  

we have a staff of sales and business development personnel in the uk who identify new revenuegenerating opportunities develop and maintain key account relationships and tailor service offerings to meet the needs of specific customers a good relationship has been maintained with the bbc and good relationships have been developed and maintained with many of the major broadcasters and wireless communications carriers in the uk 

  

competition 

  

ccuk’s primary competition to its site leasing business comes from building owners including utilities that lease space on colocatable rooftop sites ntl also offers site rental on approximately 2300 of its sites some of which are managed on behalf of third parties uk mobile operators own site infrastructure and lease space to other users their openness to sharing with direct competitors varies by operator however several operators have made public statements indicating they are willing to share or jointly develop certain sites with competitors or other third parties under certain circumstances 

  

ccuk’s primary competitors with respect to its dtt broadcast transmission platform are satellite and cable broadcast operators including bskyb ntl telewest and cable  wireless ntl is ccuk’s primary competitor in the terrestrial broadcast transmission market in the uk ntl retains partial ownership of both the sdn dtt multiplex and digital one the national independent digital radio licensee ntl has also been awarded the transmission contract for two of the six dtt multiplexes ccuk operates the transmission network contracts for the other four dtt multiplexes two for the bbc and two for the ccuk licensed multiplexes 

  

although ccuk and ntl are broadcast transmission service competitors they have reciprocal rights to the use of each other’s sites for broadcast transmission usage in order to enable each of them to achieve uk nationwide coverage this relationship is formalized by the ntl sitesharing agreement entered into in 1991 the time at which ntl was privatized see “business—the company—uk operations—significant contracts—ntl sitesharing agreement” 

  

ccuk faces competition from a large number of companies in the provision of network services the companies include specialty consultants and equipment manufacturers such as nortel and ericsson ntl also offers certain network services to its customers including installation and maintenance 

  

australia operations 

  

our primary business in australia is the leasing of antenna space to wireless carriers ccal a joint venture which is owned 776 by us and 224 by permanent nominees aust ltd acting on behalf of a group of professional and institutional investors led by jump capital limited is our principal australian operating subsidiary our principal customers in australia are optus vodafone australia hutchison and telstra  

  

ccal is the largest independent tower operator in australia with a nationwide tower portfolio providing sites for cellular coverage for substantially all of the australian population as of december 31 2003 ccal has 1388 towers with a strategic presence in all of australia’s licensed regions including sydney melbourne brisbane adelaide and perth 

  

through its acquisition of towers from optus which was substantially completed in april 2000 ccal has 759 towers including towers built or acquired subsequent to the initial closing as part of this transaction optus agreed to lease space on these towers for an initial term of 15 years the arrangement relating to ccal developing future tower sites for optus was terminated in march 2002 by mutual consent 

  

through its acquisition of towers from vodafone australia which was substantially completed in april 2001 ccal has 629 towers including towers built or acquired subsequent to the initial closing as part of this transaction vodafone australia has agreed to lease space on these towers for an initial rent free term of 10 years and ccal has the exclusive right to acquire up to 600 additional tower sites that vodafone may construct through april 2007 

  

in australia ccal competes with other independent tower owners which also provide site rental and network services wireless carriers which own and operate their own tower networks service companies that provide engineering and site acquisition services and other site owners such as broadcasters and building owners the two other significant tower owners in australia are telstra and broadcast australia we believe that tower location capacity quality of service deployment speed and price within a geographic market are the most significant competitive factors affecting the leasing of a site 

  

in 2003 hutchison launched a 3g network in australia and as part of its deployment has utilized a number of our towers in connection with such 3g network vodafone australia has announced that it intends to deploy a 3g network with the launch targeted for 2005 the other two major carriers in australia telstra and optus have yet to announce their 3g plans 

  

employees 

  

at december 31 2003 we employed approximately 1390 people worldwide other than in the uk we are not a party to any collective bargaining agreements in the uk we are party to a collective bargaining agreement with the broadcast entertainment cinematographic and theatrical union bectu this agreement establishes bargaining procedures relating to the terms and conditions of employment for all of ccuk’s nonmanagement staff in july 2003 ccuk successfully negotiated with bectu modifications to the pension arrangements relating to the former employees of the bbc approximately 216 employees which repositioned the plan to better meet its funding requirements we have not experienced any strikes or work stoppages and management believes that our employee relations are satisfactory 

  

regulatory matters 

  

to date we have not incurred any material fines or penalties or experienced any material adverse effects to our business as a result of any domestic or international regulations the summary below is based on regulations currently in effect and such regulations are subject to review and modification by the applicable governmental authority from time to time see “business—risk factors” 

  

united states 

  

federal regulations 

  

both the fcc and faa regulate towers used for wireless communications transmitters and receivers such regulations control the siting and marking of towers and may depending on the characteristics of particular towers require the registration of tower facilities and the issuance of determinations confirming no hazard to air traffic wireless communications devices operating on towers are separately regulated and independently licensed based upon the particular frequency used in addition the fcc and the faa have developed standards to consider proposals for new or modified tower and antenna structures based upon the height and location including proximity to airports proposals to construct or to modify existing tower and antenna structures above certain heights are reviewed by the faa to ensure the structure will not present a hazard to aviation which determination may be 

  

conditioned upon compliance with lighting and marking requirements the fcc requires its licensees to operate communications devices only on towers that comply with faa rules and are registered with the fcc if required by its regulations where tower lighting is required by faa regulation tower owners bear the responsibility of notifying the faa of any tower lighting outage failure to comply with the applicable requirements may lead to civil penalties 

  

local regulations 

  

local regulations include city and other local ordinances including subdivision and zoning ordinances approvals for construction and removal of towers and restrictive covenants imposed by community developers these regulations vary greatly but typically require us to obtain approval from local officials prior to tower construction local zoning authorities may render decisions or place conditions on construction that are responsive to community residents’ concerns regarding the height and visibility of the towers 

  

other regulations 

  

we hold through certain of our subsidiaries certain licenses for radio transmission facilities granted by the fcc including licenses for common carrier microwave and commercial mobile radio services in puerto rico including specialized mobile radio and paging facilities as well as private mobile radio services including industrialbusiness radio facilities which are subject to additional regulation by the fcc our fcc license relating to the 1670 to 1675 mhz spectrum band contains certain conditions related to the services that may be provided thereunder the technical equipment used in connection therewith and the circumstances under which it may be renewed we are required to obtain the fcc’s approval prior to the transfer of control of any of our fcc licenses 

  

united kingdom 

  

as a result of european union initiatives to consolidate and update telecommunications and broadcasting regulation and prepare for increasing convergence in the broadcasting and telecommunications industries the communications act 2003 was enacted in the uk in july 2003 this act consolidates previous uk broadcasting and telecommunications legislation and replaced various uk regulatory bodies including the office of telecommunications “oftel” the independent television commission “itc” the broadcasting standards commission the radio authority and the radiocommunications agency with a single body the office of communications “ofcom” to regulate broadcasting and telecommunications 

  

in addition to the various provisions in the communications act 2003 regulating uk electronic wireless systems there are additional statutory provisions regulating site development and the safe use of electronic communications equipment in the uk as further described below 

  

site rental business regulations 

  

planning regulations town and country planning legislation operated by local planning authorities regulates development across the uk including the location height visibility and appearance of sites and the number and size of antennas located on such sites different town planning regulations apply in england wales scotland and northern ireland local authority planning approval is generally required prior to the construction or modification of sites and planning authorities can also refuse permission or impose restrictions on such developments 

  

tower structures near airfields or affected by aircraft safeguarding provisions also require civil aviation or ministry of defense clearance prior to construction and radio frequencies emitted from wireless systems must observe international frequency clearance restrictions 

  

frequency licenses as a result of the communications act 2003 the frequency licenses previously issued by the former radiocommunications agency have been superseded by equivalent licenses issued by ofcom as the successor agency ccuk holds over 300 frequency licenses used to provide fixed pointtopoint telecommunication backhaul radio links for its northern ireland network for tmobile these telecommunication frequency licenses must be renewed annually with the payment of a fee 

  

wireless electronic communications systems located on ccuk sites were subject to separate licensing obligations under the telecommunications act 1984 at the end of 2003 the statutory requirement for these systems licenses was replaced by general and special conditions published pursuant to provisions contained in the communications act 2003 

  

health  safety regulations the use of radio frequencies by ccuk’s or a customer’s electronic equipment is subject to compliance with health and safety legislation and to guidance issued by the national radiological protection board “nrpb” the uk government commissioned and in 2000 published the “stewart report” a report conducted by an independent expert group to consider the safety of mobile phones and base stations the report basically concludes that there is no evidence of a general health risk but suggests a precautionary approach and recommends the adoption of guidelines established by the international commission on nonionising radiation protection “icnirp” which guidelines are stricter than those of the nrpb although the icnirp guidelines have not yet been adopted in the uk mobile operators and ccuk generally follow such guidelines 

  

a january 2004 report requested by the nrpb and conducted by the independent advisory group on nonionising radiation “agnir” basically concludes that evidence indicated that radio frequency levels in the vicinity of mobile base stations were low and unlikely to pose a health risk the agnir report also basically concludes that epidemiological studies overall did not support causal associations between radio frequency exposure and the risk of cancer in particular from mobile phone use nor any other adverse health effect from radio frequency exposures at levels below icnirp guidelines the report noted however that longterm effects are not yet known 

  

the nrpb has stated that in early 2004 it will recommend new exposure guidelines for electromagnetic fields and it is anticipated that the guidelines will be the icnirp or similar guidelines 

  

transmission business regulations 

  

the communications act 2003 the town and country planning regulations requirements for frequency licenses modification of requirements for licenses for telecommunications network systems and the health and safety provisions referred to above also apply to ccuk’s broadcast transmission network sites and services 

  

frequency licenses ccuk holds a number of licenses under the wireless telegraphy acts 1949 1968 and 1998 as amended by the communications act 2003 authorizing the use of certain allocated radio frequencies including frequency licenses relating to 1 the broadcast transmission spectrum allocated to ccuk’s terrestrial analog and digital broadcast transmission services 2 fixed pointtopoint links for analog and digital broadcast relay and distribution services and 3 spectrum used by ccuk’s two dtt multiplexes 

  

all these frequency licenses have to be renewed annually with the payment of a fee the bbc virgin radio talksport and switchdigital have each contracted to pay their portion of these fees ccuk is also obliged to pay these fees in respect of its dtt and fixed link broadcast spectrum licenses 

  

dtt multiplex operator licenses in august 2002 ccuk was granted two 12year dtt multiplex operator licenses by the itc now part of ofcom to provide dtt broadcasting services in the uk with a 12year renewal option each of these two licenses is subject to service conditions including conditions regarding signal quality marketing and fairness and open competition regarding contracts with content providers in addition ccuk is obligated to implement certain power increases see “business—the company—uk operations—transmission business” 

  

australia 

  

federal regulation 

  

carrier licenses and nominated carrier declarations issued under the federal telecommunications act 1997 authorize the use of network units for the supply of telecommunications services to the public the definition of “network units” includes line links and base stations used for wireless telephony services but does not include tower infrastructure accordingly ccal as a tower owner and operator does not require a carrier license similarly 

  

because ccal does not own any transmitters or spectrum it does not currently require any apparatus or spectrum licenses issued under the federal radiocommunications act 1992 

  

carriers have a statutory obligation to provide other carriers with access to sites and if there is a dispute including a pricing dispute the matter may be referred to the australian competition and consumer commission for resolution as a noncarrier ccal is not subject to this regime and negotiates site access on a commercial basis 

  

while the federal telecommunications act 1997 grants certain exemptions from planning laws for the installation of “low impact facilities” towers are expressly excluded from the definition of “low impact facilities” accordingly in connection with the construction and structural enhancement of towers ccal is subject to state and local planning laws which vary on a site by site basis for a limited number of sites ccal is also required to install aircraft warning lighting in compliance with federal aviation regulations 

  

local regulations 

  

in australia there are various local state and territory laws and regulations which relate to among other things town planning and zoning restrictions standards and approvals for the design construction or alteration of a structure or facility and environmental regulations as in the us these laws vary greatly but typically require tower owners to obtain approval from government bodies prior to tower construction and to comply with environmental laws on an ongoing basis 

  

environmental matters 

  

to date we have not incurred any material fines or penalties or experienced any material adverse effects to our business as a result of any domestic or international environmental regulations or matters see “business—risk factors” 

  

our operations are subject to foreign federal state and local laws and regulations relating to the management use storage disposal emission and remediation of and exposure to hazardous and nonhazardous substances materials and wastes as an owner and operator of real property we are subject to certain environmental laws that impose strict jointandseveral liability for the cleanup of onsite or offsite contamination relating to existing or historical operations and we could also be subject to personal injury or property damage claims relating to such contamination we are potentially subject to environmental and cleanup liabilities in the us uk and australia 

  

as licensees and site owners we are also subject to regulations and guidelines that impose a variety of operational requirements relating to radio frequency emissions as employers we are subject to osha and similar guidelines regarding employee protection from radio frequency exposure the potential connection between radio frequency emissions and certain negative health effects including some forms of cancer has been the subject of substantial study by the scientific community in recent years to date the results of these studies have been inconclusive 

  

we have compliance programs and monitoring projects to help assure that we are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws nevertheless there can be no assurance that the costs of compliance with existing or future environmental laws will not have a material adverse effect on us 

  

risk factors 

  

you should carefully consider the risks described below as well as the other information contained in this document when evaluating your investment in our securities 

  

substantial level of indebtedness—our substantial level of indebtedness may adversely affect our ability to react to changes in our business we may also be limited in our ability to use debt to fund future capital needs 

  

we have a substantial amount of indebtedness the following chart sets forth certain important credit information and is presented as of december 31 2003 after giving effect to the completion of the cash tender offers for our 9 senior notes and our 9 1  2  senior notes dollars in thousands 

  

   

as a result of our substantial indebtedness 

  

   

   

   

   

   

we cannot guarantee that we will be able to generate enough cash flow from operations or that we will be able to obtain enough capital to service our debt or pay our obligations under our preferred stock in addition we may need to refinance some or all of our indebtedness on or before maturity we cannot guarantee that we will be able to refinance our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all if we are unable to refinance our subsidiary debt or renegotiate the terms of such debt we may not be able to meet our debt service requirements including interest payments on the notes in the future in addition our various credit facilities will require periodic interest payments on amounts borrowed thereunder which amounts can be substantial 

  

restrictive debt covenants—the terms of our debt instruments limit our ability to receive cash dividends from our subsidiaries or otherwise take a number of actions that our management might otherwise believe to be in our best interests in addition if we fail to comply with our covenants our debt may be accelerated 

  

currently we have debt instruments that restrict our ability to incur more indebtedness pay dividends create liens sell assets and engage in certain mergers and acquisitions our subsidiaries under their debt instruments are also required to maintain specific financial ratios our ability to comply with the restrictions of these instruments and to satisfy our debt obligations will depend on our future operating performance if we fail to comply with the debt restrictions we will be in default under those instruments which in some cases may cause the maturity of substantially all of our indebtedness to be accelerated 

  

we are a holding company with no business operations of our own we conduct all of our business operations through our subsidiaries accordingly our only source of cash to pay interest and principal on our outstanding indebtedness or to pay dividends or make other distributions on our capital stock is distributions relating to our ownership interest in our subsidiaries from the cash flows and net earnings generated by such subsidiaries or from proceeds of debt or equity offerings the terms of the amended 2000 credit facility restrict ccoc’s ability to pay dividends or to make distributions and in any event any such permitted dividends or distributions may only be paid if no default has occurred under the applicable instrument further under the terms of the crown atlantic credit facility crown atlantic is prohibited from making any dividends or distributions to us for the year ended december 31 2003 crown atlantic produced 125 of our consolidated revenue 

  

if our subsidiaries are unable to dividend cash to us when we need it we may be unable to pay dividends or satisfy our obligations including interest and principal payments under our debt instruments the restrictions relating to our credit facilities and other indebtedness may also effect our decisions relating to certain strategic growth opportunities 

  

our business depends on the demand for wireless communications and towers—we may be adversely affected by any slowdown in the growth of or reduction in demand for wireless communications 

  

demand for our sites depends on demand for communication sites from wireless carriers which in turn depends on the demand for wireless services the willingness of wireless carriers to utilize our infrastructure is affected by numerous factors including 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

a slowdown in the growth of or reduction in demand in a particular wireless segment may adversely affect the demand for our sites moreover wireless carriers often operate with substantial indebtedness and financial problems for our customers may result in accounts receivable going uncollected the loss of a customer and associated lease revenue or a reduced ability of these customers to finance expansion activities a slowdown in the deployment of equipment for new wireless technology the consolidation of wireless carriers the sharing of networks by wireless carriers or the increased use of alternative sites may also adversely affect the demand for our sites finally advances in technology such as the development of new antenna systems new terrestrial deployment technologies and new satellite systems may reduce the need for landbased or terrestrial transmission networks or our sites to some extent almost all of the above factors have occurred in recent years with an adverse effect on our business and such factors are likely to persist in the future the occurrence of any of these factors may negatively impact our revenues result in an impairment of our assets or otherwise have a material adverse effect on us 

  

a substantial portion of our revenues is derived from a small number of customers including verizon wireless the bbc tmobile and cingular—the loss or consolidation of or network sharing among any of our limited number of customers may materially decrease revenues 

  

approximately 637 of our revenues are derived from 10 customers including verizon wireless the bbc tmobile and cingular which represented 137 132 101 and 91 of our revenues respectively for the year ended december 31 2003 the loss of any one of our large customers as a result of bankruptcy consolidation or merger with other customers of ours or otherwise may materially decrease our revenues and have other adverse effects on our business 

  

in addition a substantial portion of our revenues is received from a few major wireless carrier and broadcast customers particularly those customers that have transferred their tower assets to us we cannot guarantee that the 

  

leases including management service agreements with such carriers will not be terminated or that these carriers will renew such agreements 

  

our broadcast transmission business is substantially dependent on our contracts with the bbc we cannot guarantee that the bbc will renew our contracts or that they will not attempt to negotiate terms that are not as favorable to us as those in place now if we were to lose these bbc contracts our business results of operations and financial condition would be materially adversely affected the initial term of our analog transmission contract with the bbc can be terminated on march 31 2007 and the initial terms of our two dtt contracts with the bbc expire on october 31 2008 and october 31 2010 respectively 

  

a substantial portion of our uk broadcast transmission operations is conducted using sites owned by ntl our principal broadcast competitor in the uk ntl also utilizes our sites for its broadcast transmission operations this site sharing arrangement with ntl may be terminated on december 31 2015 or any 10year anniversary of that date with five years’ prior notice by either us or ntl and may be terminated sooner if there is a continuing breach of the agreement we cannot guarantee that this agreement will not be terminated which may have a material adverse effect on us 

  

wireless service providers frequently enter into agreements with their competitors allowing them to utilize one another’s wireless communications facilities to accommodate customers who are out of range of their home providers’ services in addition wireless service providers have also entered into agreements allowing two or more carriers to share a single wireless network or jointly develop a tower portfolio in certain locations such agreements may be viewed by wireless service providers as a superior alternative to leasing space for their own antennas on our sites the proliferation of these roaming network sharing and joint development agreements may have a material adverse effect on us 

  

economic and wireless telecommunications industry slowdown—an economic or wireless telecommunications industry slowdown may materially and adversely affect our business including reducing demand for our towers and network services and the business of our customers 

  

in recent years the economies of the countries in which we operate particularly in the wireless telecommunications industry have experienced significant general slowdowns which have negatively affected the factors described in these risk factors influencing demand for tower space and network services similar slowdowns in the future may reduce consumer demand for wireless services or negatively impact the debt and equity markets thereby causing carriers to delay or abandon implementation of new systems and technologies including 3g and other wireless broadband services further the war on terrorism the threat of additional terrorist attacks the political and economic uncertainties resulting therefrom and other unforeseen events may impose additional risks upon and adversely affect the wireless telecommunications industry and us 

  

we believe that the recent economic slowdowns particularly in the wireless telecommunications industry have already harmed and similar slowdowns may further harm the financial condition or operations of wireless service providers some of which including customers of ours have filed for bankruptcy protection 

  

we operate our business in a competitive industry and some of our competitors have significantly more resources or less debt than we do—as a result of this competition we may find it more difficult to achieve favorable lease rates on our sites 

  

we face competition for site rental customers from various sources including 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

wireless carriers that own and operate their own tower portfolios generally are substantially larger and have greater financial resources than we have further the financial status of certain of our competitors may lead to increased competition in certain areas competition for tenants on sites may adversely affect lease rates and service income 

  

new technologies may make our site leasing services less desirable to potential tenants and result in decreasing revenues—such new technologies may decrease demand for site leases and negatively impact our revenues 

  

the development and deployment of signal combining technologies which permit one antenna to service multiple frequencies and thereby multiple customers may reduce the need for our antenna space or broadcast transmission services in addition other technologies which may be developed and emerge may serve as substitutes and alternatives to leasing which might otherwise be anticipated or expected on our sites had such technologies not existed 

  

mobile satellite systems and other new technologies may compete with landbased wireless communications systems thereby reducing the demand for tower space and other services we provide the fcc has granted license applications for several lowearth orbiting satellite systems that are intended to provide mobile voice or data services the growth in delivery of video services by direct broadcast satellites may also adversely affect demand for our antenna space 

  

any reduction in site leasing demand resulting from multiple frequency antennas satellite or other technologies may negatively impact our revenues or otherwise have a material adverse effect on us 

  

new technologies may not perform as projected—25g3g and other technologies including digital terrestrial television may not deploy or be adopted by customers as rapidly or in the manner projected 

  

there can be no assurances that 25g3g or other new wireless technologies including dtt will be introduced or deployed as rapidly or in the manner previously or presently projected by the wireless or broadcast industries the deployment of 3g has already been significantly delayed from prior projections in addition demand and customer adoption rates for such new technologies may be lower or slower than anticipated for numerous reasons as a result growth opportunities and demand for site rental or broadcast transmission as a result of such technologies may not be realized at the times or to the extent previously or presently anticipated 

  

we generally lease or sublease the land under our towers and may not be able to maintain these leases—if we fail to protect our rights against persons claiming superior rights in our communications sites our business may be adversely affected 

  

our real property interests relating to our communications sites consist primarily of leasehold and subleasehold interests fee interests easements licenses and rightsofway a loss of these interests may interfere with our ability to conduct our business and generate revenues for various reasons we may not always have the ability to access analyze and verify all information regarding titles and other issues prior to completing an acquisition of sites further we may not be able to renew ground leases on commercially viable terms approximately 12 of our sites are on land where our property interests in such land have a final expiration date of less than 10 years our inability to protect our rights to the land under our towers may have a material adverse affect on us 

  

our international operations expose us to changes in foreign currency exchange rates—we may suffer losses as a result of changes in currency exchange rates 

  

we conduct business in countries outside the us which exposes us to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates for the year ended december 31 2003 approximately 443 of our consolidated revenues and approximately 798 of our consolidated capital expenditures originated outside the us all of which were denominated in currencies other than us dollars principally british pounds sterling and australian dollars we have not historically engaged in significant hedging activities relating to our nonus dollar operations and we may suffer future losses as a result of changes in currency exchange rates 

  

we may need additional financing which may not be available for strategic growth opportunities or contractual obligations—if we are unable to raise capital in the future when needed we may not be able to fund future growth opportunities 

  

over time we may require significant capital expenditures for strategic growth opportunities or contractual obligations verizon has the right after july 1 2007 to require us to purchase for cash its interest in crown atlantic see “business—the company—us operations” 

  

as of december 31 2003 after giving effect to the completion of the cash tender offers for our 9 senior notes and our 9 1  2  senior notes in january 2004 we had consolidated cash and cash equivalents of 1914 million we also had approximately 15 billion in outstanding borrowings under our credit facilities at that date our ability to borrow under the credit facilities is limited by the covenants contained in those agreements including covenants relating to current financial performance as defined in the various credit agreements levels of indebtedness and debt service requirements under the terms of the credit facilities we could draw approximately 396 million in additional borrowings as of february 18 2004 while remaining in compliance with these covenants 

  

we may need additional sources of debt or equity capital in the future to fund future growth opportunities additional financing may not be available or may be restricted by the terms of our credit facilities and the terms of our other outstanding indebtedness additional sales of equity securities will dilute our existing stockholders if we are unable to raise capital when our needs arise we may not be able to fund future growth opportunities 

  

fluctuations in market interest rates—fluctuations in market interest rates may increase interest expense relating to our floating rate indebtedness 

  

certain of the financial instruments we have used to obtain capital including our 2000 credit facility as amended and crown atlantic’s credit facility are subject to market risks from fluctuations in market interest rates specifically the london interbank offer rate “libor” as of december 31 2003 approximately 570 of our financial instruments are longterm fixed interest rate notes and debentures however a fluctuation in libor of one percentage point for all of 2004 would impact our interest expense by approximately 140 million as of december 31 2003 we have approximately 14848 million of floating rate indebtedness of which 838 million has been effectively converted to fixed rate indebtedness through the use of an interest rate swap agreement 

  

laws and regulations which could change at any time and with which we could fail to comply regulate our business—if we fail to comply with applicable laws or regulations we may be fined or even lose our right to conduct some of our business 

  

a variety of foreign federal state and local laws and regulations apply to our business failure to comply with applicable requirements may lead to civil penalties or require us to assume indemnification obligations or breach contractual provisions we cannot guarantee that existing or future laws or regulations including state and local tax laws will not adversely affect our business increase delays or result in additional costs these factors may have a material adverse effect on us 

  

variability in demand for network services business reduces the predictability of our results—our network services business has historically experienced significant volatility in demand 

  

the operating results of our network services business for any particular period may vary significantly and should not necessarily be considered indicative of longerterm results network services revenues have also been adversely impacted in the us in recent years due to reduced antenna installation activity and our strategic decision to reduce our network service offerings as a result our network services business has and should continue to become less significant to our operations 

  

we are heavily dependent on our senior management—if we lose members of our senior management we may not be able to find appropriate replacements on a timely basis and our business may be adversely affected 

  

our existing operations and continued future development depend to a significant extent upon the performance and active participation of certain key individuals as employees including our chief executive officer we cannot guarantee that we will be successful in retaining the services of these or other key personnel if we were to lose any of these individuals we may not be able to find or integrate appropriate replacements on a timely basis and we may be materially adversely affected 

  

emissions from antennas on our sites or wireless devices may create health risks—we may suffer from future claims if the radio frequency emissions from equipment on our sites is demonstrated to cause negative health effects 

  

the fcc nrpb and other government agencies impose requirements and other guidelines on its licensees relating to radio frequency emissions the potential connection between radio frequency emissions and certain negative health effects including some forms of cancer has been the subject of substantial study by the scientific community in recent years to date the results of these studies have been inconclusive we cannot guarantee that claims relating to radio frequency emissions will not arise in the future or that the results of such studies will not be adverse to us 

  

public perception of possible health risks associated with cellular and other wireless communications may slow or diminish the growth of wireless companies which may in turn slow or diminish our growth in particular negative public perception of and regulations regarding these perceived health risks may slow or diminish the market acceptance of wireless communications services 

  

our exposure to the potential risk of harm due to radio frequency emissions may increase as the number of rooftop sites in our portfolios including the bt sites increases see “business—the company—uk operations—significant contracts—bt site agreement” rooftop sites may tend to be more accessible to a wider range of personnel including personnel with little or no knowledge of wireless communications equipment than towers increasing the number of persons who may be potentially exposed to emissions emanating from equipment located on such sites 

  

if a connection between radio emissions and possible negative health effects were established our operations costs and revenues would be materially and adversely affected we do not maintain any significant insurance with respect to these matters 

  

antitakeover provisions in our certificate of incorporation and competition laws may have effects that conflict with the interests of our stockholders—certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation bylaws and operative agreements and domestic and international competition laws may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us or for us to acquire control of a third party even if such a change in control would be beneficial to you 

  

we have a number of antitakeover devices in place that will hinder takeover attempts and may reduce the market value of our common stock our antitakeover provisions include 

  

   

   

   

   

our bylaws permit special meetings of the stockholders to be called only upon the request of a majority of the board of directors and deny stockholders the ability to call such meetings further our bbc contracts may be terminated upon the occurrence of certain change of control events described in such contracts such provisions as well as the provisions of section 203 of the delaware general corporation law may impede a merger consolidation takeover or other business combination or discourage a potential acquiror from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us 

  

in addition domestic and international competition laws may prevent or discourage us from acquiring towers or tower networks in certain geographical areas or impede a merger consolidation takeover or other business combination or discourage a potential acquiror from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us 

  

shares eligible for future sale—sales of a substantial number of shares of common stock may adversely affect the market price of the common stock 

  

future sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock may adversely affect the market price of our common stock as of february 26 2004 we had 221325639 shares of common stock outstanding in addition we have reserved 24771821 shares of common stock for issuance under our various stock compensation plans 1639990 shares of common stock upon exercise of outstanding warrants 21237303 shares of common stock for the conversion of our 4 senior notes and 16066944 shares of common stock for the conversion of our outstanding convertible preferred stock 

  

a small number of shareholders own a significant percentage of our outstanding common stock if any one of these shareholders or any group of our shareholders sells a large quantity of shares of our common stock or the public market perceives that existing shareholders might sell shares of common stock the market price of our common stock may significantly decline 

  

the holders of our 8 1  4  convertible preferred stock and our 625 convertible preferred stock are entitled to receive cumulative dividends at the rate of 8 1  4  per annum approximately 165 million and 625 per annum approximately 199 million respectively payable on a quarterly basis we have the option to pay the dividends on such series of preferred stock in cash or in shares of our common stock we have historically paid such dividends with shares of our common stock and we expect to continue to do so the number of shares of our common stock required to be issued to pay such dividends is dependent upon the current market value of our common stock at the time such dividend is required to be paid from time to time we have elected to repurchase the shares of common stock issued as dividends effectively paying the dividends in cash utilizing cash from an unrestricted investment subsidiary in order to mitigate or offset the dilutive effect of the common stock issued to pay such dividends upon the shares of our common stock otherwise outstanding we may continue to repurchase shares of common stock issued as dividends on our preferred stock in order to mitigate such dilution however there can be no assurances that we will do so 

  

we have experienced disputes with customers and suppliers—such disputes may lead to increased tensions damaged relationships or litigation which may result in the loss of a key customer or supplier 

  

we have experienced certain conflicts or disputes between ourselves and some of our customers and service providers most of these disputes relate to the interpretation of terms in our contracts while we seek to resolve such 

  

conflicts amicably and have generally resolved customer and supplier disputes on commercially reasonable terms such disputes may lead to increased tensions and damaged relationships between ourselves and these entities some of whom are key customers or suppliers of ours in addition if we are unable to resolve these differences amicably we may be forced to litigate these disputes in order to enforce or defend our rights there can be no assurances as to the outcome of these disputes damaged relationships or litigation with our key customers or suppliers may lead to decreased revenues including as a result of losing a customer or increased costs which could have a material adverse effect on us

in the uk we also lease and maintain three regional offices in altringham bristol and hemel hempstead england which provide service and support for our site rental business in addition we lease approximately 11300 square feet of office space in central london which we do not use or contemplate using the london space is subleased on a shortterm basis and the sublease payments offset our current rent obligation under the lease 

  

in the us our interests in our tower sites are comprised of a variety of ownership interests leases created by longterm lease agreements easements licenses or rightsofway granted by government entities in the us 19 of the sites are occupied by guyed towers which are located on an average of approximately 136000 square feet of land the remaining 81 are nonguyed monopole selfsupport etc which are located on an average of approximately 20500 square feet of land these tracts support the towers equipment shelters and where applicable guy wires to stabilize the structure the actual square footage of any particular site depends on a number of things including the topography of the site the size of the area the landlord is willing to lease the number of customers locating on the tower and the type of structure at the site as selfsupporting and monopole tower structures typically require less land area than a guyed tower our land leases subleases and licenses generally have five or tenyear initial terms and frequently contain one or more renewal options as of december 31 2003 8855 of our us sites or approximately 83 of our us portfolio were leased subleased or licensed while 1787 or approximately 17 

  

were owned in fee or through a permanent easement or similar interest under the 2000 credit facility and the crown atlantic credit facility as amended our senior lenders have liens on a substantial number of our land leases and other property interests in the us 

  

in the uk tower sites range from less than 400 square feet for a small rural tv booster station to over 50 acres for a highpower radio station as in the us the site accommodates the towers equipment buildings or shelters and where applicable guy wires to support the structure land is either owned freehold which is usual for the larger sites or is held on leases that generally have terms of between 10 and 21 years as of december 31 2003 we owned 417 freehold sites and had approximately 2332 land leases in the uk in addition we have a master lease agreement with respect to 738 bt sites primarily rooftops

overview 

  

our primary business is leasing towers that we own to major wireless service providers in the three countries in which we operate—the united states us the united kingdom uk and australia our customers use our tower sites to locate antennas and other equipment necessary for the transmission of wireless signals for mobile telephones and other devices this leasing activity represents approximately 68 of our consolidated revenues in the uk our subsidiary ccuk also operates broadcast transmission networks for both analog and digital radio and television this broadcast transmission business represents approximately 17 of our consolidated revenues we also provide network services in the us and uk which consist primarily of project management services for antenna installations on our companyowned tower sites on behalf of wireless service providers 

  

our site rental leasing and broadcast transmission revenues combined represent approximately 85 of our consolidated revenues and are derived from the core businesses we are seeking to grow to increase the utilization of our existing tower site assets typically these revenues result from longterm 510 year contracts with our customers with renewal terms at the option of the customer as a result in any given year approximately 90 to 95 of our site rental and broadcast transmission revenue has been contracted for in a prior year and is of a recurring nature when we discuss growth in this core business we are generally describing the rate at which we are adding revenues to the previously contracted base sometimes referred to as the revenue “runrate” 

  

the network services business is not typically recurring and is largely incidental to our site rental and broadcast transmission business it usually has lower margins and is not a key to our future growth such activities are generally pursued at the request of a customer in order to facilitate our leasing activities or otherwise to better serve our customers’ site requirements network services revenues declined as a percentage of our total revenues during 2002 and 2003 and we expect such decline to continue in the foreseeable future 

  

the growth of our business depends substantially on the condition of the wireless communications and broadcast industries we believe that the demand for new communications sites will continue although possibly not at the levels experienced prior to 2002 the level of demand for new sites declined in 2002 as compared to 2001 as evidenced by a decrease of approximately 40 in the number of new tenants we were able to add to our sites while the total number of new additions on our towers decreased for the first half of 2003 as compared to the first half of 2002 the rate of new tenant additions during the second half of 2003 was approximately constant with the rate of new additions that we experienced during the second half of 2002 during the second half of 2003 we began to see signs of increased activity in the form of additional applications for our us sites by wireless carriers while there can be no assurances that these applications will result in additional tenant additions to our towers we believe this increase in expressions of interest reflects a renewed focus by our us carriers on the quality of their wireless networks we expect that due to increased competition wireless carriers will continue to seek operating and capital efficiencies by 1 outsourcing certain network services and the buildout and operation of new and existing infrastructure and 2 utilizing thirdparty tower sites as a common location for the placement of their antennas and transmission equipment alongside the equipment of other wireless service providers 

  

the willingness of wireless carriers to utilize our infrastructure and related services is affected by numerous factors including 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

our revenues that are derived from the provision of transmission services to the broadcasting industry will be affected by among other things 

  

   

   

   

   

as an important part of our business strategy we will seek to 

  

   

   

   

   

critical accounting policies 

  

the following is a discussion of the accounting policies that we believe 1 are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and 2 require our most difficult subjective or complex judgments often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 

  

revenue recognition 

  

site rental and broadcast transmission revenues are recognized on a monthly basis over the term of the relevant lease agreement or contract in accordance with applicable accounting standards these revenues are recognized on a straightline basis regardless of whether the payments from the customer are received in equal monthly amounts 

  

some agreements provide for rentfree periods at the beginning of the lease term while others call for rent to be prepaid for some period if the payment terms call for fixed escalations as in fixed dollar or fixed percentage increases the effect of such increases is spread evenly over the term of the agreement as a result of this accounting method a portion of the revenue recognized in a given period represents cash collected in other periods for 2001 2002 and 2003 the noncash portion of our site rental and broadcast transmission revenues amounted to approximately 236 million 264 million and 288 million respectively 

  

network services revenues are generally recognized under the completed contract method under the completed contract method revenues and costs for a particular project are recognized in total at the completion date when using the completed contract method of accounting for network services revenues we must accurately determine the completion date for the project in order to record the revenues and costs in the proper period for antenna installations we consider the project complete when the customer can begin transmitting its signal through the antenna we must also be able to estimate losses on uncompleted contracts as such losses must be recognized as soon as they are known the completed contract method is used for projects that require relatively short periods of time to complete generally less than one year we do not believe that our use of the completed contract method for network services projects produces operating results that differ substantially from the percentageofcompletion method 

  

some of our arrangements with our customers call for the performance of multiple revenuegenerating activities generally these arrangements include both site rental and network services in such cases we determine whether the multiple deliverables are to be accounted for separately or on a combined basis in order to be accounted for separately the undelivered items must 1 have standalone value to the customer 2 have reliably determinable fair value on a separate basis and 3 have delivery which is probable and under our control allocation of recognized revenue in such arrangements is based on the relative fair value of the separately delivered items we have generally determined that it is appropriate to account for antenna installation activities separately from the customer’s subsequent site rentals 

  

allowance for doubtful accounts receivable 

  

as part of our normal accounting procedures we must evaluate our outstanding accounts receivable to estimate whether they will be collected this is a subjective process that involves making judgments about our customers’ ability and willingness to pay these accounts an allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded as an offset to accounts receivable in order to present a net balance that we believe will be collected in estimating the appropriate balance for this allowance we consider 1 specific reserves for accounts we believe may prove to be uncollectible and 2 additional reserves based on historical collections for the remainder of our accounts additions to the allowance for doubtful accounts are charged to costs of operations and deductions from the allowance are recorded when specific accounts receivable are written off as uncollectible if our estimate of uncollectible accounts should prove to be inaccurate at some future date the results of operations for the period could be materially affected by any necessary correction to the allowance for doubtful accounts 

  

valuation of longlived assets 

  

we review the carrying values of property and equipment and other longlived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable if the sum of the estimated future cash flows undiscounted from the asset is less than its carrying amount an impairment loss is recognized measurement of an impairment loss is based on the fair value of the asset our determination that an adverse event or change in circumstance has occurred will generally involve 1 a deterioration in an asset’s financial performance compared to historical results 2 a shortfall in an asset’s financial performance compared to forecasted results or 3 a change in strategy affecting the utility of the asset our measurement of the fair value of an impaired asset will generally be based on an estimate of discounted future cash flows 

  

depreciation expense for our property and equipment is computed using the straightline method over the estimated useful lives of our various classes of assets the substantial portion of our property and equipment represents the cost of our towers and broadcast transmission equipment which are depreciated with an estimated useful life of 20 years 

  

on january 1 2002 we adopted the new accounting standard for goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with that new standard we test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis regardless of whether adverse events or changes in circumstances have occurred this annual impairment test involves 1 a step to identify potential impairment at a reporting unit level based on fair values and 2 a step to measure the amount of the impairment if any our measurement of the fair value for goodwill is based on an estimate of discounted future cash flows of the reporting unit the most important estimates for such calculations are the expected additions of new tenants on our towers the terminal multiple for our projected cash flows and our weightedaverage cost of capital 

  

during the fourth quarter of 2003 we performed our annual update of the impairment test for goodwill the results of this test indicated that goodwill was not impaired at any of our reporting units we have included the results of the joint venture transactions with verizon communications in our most recent evaluations future declines in our site leasing and network services business could result in an impairment of goodwill in the future if an impairment were to occur in the future the calculations to measure the impairment could result in the writeoff of some portion to substantially all of our goodwill 

  

deferred income taxes 

  

we record deferred income tax assets and liabilities on our balance sheet related to events that impact our financial statements and tax returns in different periods in order to compute these deferred tax balances we first analyze the differences between the book basis and tax basis of our assets and liabilities referred to as “temporary differences” these temporary differences are then multiplied by current tax rates to arrive at the balances for the deferred income tax assets and liabilities if deferred tax assets exceed deferred tax liabilities we must estimate whether those net deferred asset amounts will be realized in the future a valuation allowance is then provided for the net deferred asset amounts that are not likely to be realized 

  

the change in our net deferred income tax balances during a period results in a deferred income tax provision or benefit in our statement of operations if our expectations about the future tax consequences of past events should prove to be inaccurate the balances of our deferred income tax assets and liabilities could require significant adjustments in future periods such adjustments could cause a material effect on our results of operations for the period of the adjustment 

  

results of operations 

  

our primary sources of revenues are from 

  

   

   

   

site rental revenues in the us are received primarily from wireless communications companies including those operating in the following categories of wireless communications 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

site rental revenues are generally recognized on a monthly basis under lease agreements which typically have original terms of five to ten years with three or four optional renewal periods of five years each 

  

broadcast transmission services revenues in the uk are received for both analog and digital transmission services monthly analog transmission revenues are principally received from the bbc under a contract with an initial 10year term through march 31 2007 the first date on which such contract may be terminated with twelve months prior notice by either party digital transmission services revenues from the bbc are recognized under a contract with an initial term of 12 years through october 31 2010 in addition in connection with the launch of freeview we receive digital transmission services revenues from the bbc bskyb and other tv content providers under contracts with initial terms of six years see “item 1 business—the company—uk operations—significant contracts” 

  

site rental revenues in the uk are received from other broadcast transmission service providers primarily ntl under a reciprocal sitesharing agreement and wireless communications companies including the uk cellular operators site rental revenues are generally recognized on a monthly basis under lease agreements with original terms of three to 12 years such lease agreements generally require annual payments in advance and include rental rate adjustment provisions between one and three years from the commencement of the lease 

  

network services revenues in the us consist of revenues from 

  

   

   

   

   

network services revenues are received primarily from wireless communications companies network services revenues in the us are recognized under service contracts which generally provide for billings on a fixed price basis demand for our network services fluctuates from period to period and within periods see “item 1 business—risk factors” consequently the operating results of our network services businesses for any particular period may vary significantly and should not be considered as indicative of longerterm results in 2002 and continuing to 2003 we made a strategic decision to reduce our network services offerings to primarily the management of antenna installations on our sites 

  

network services revenues in the uk consist of 1 antenna installation 2 network design and site selection site acquisition and site development and 3 site management and other services network design and development and related services are provided to a number of broadcasting and related organizations and certain uk wireless carriers these services are often subject to a competitive bid and a significant proportion result from an operator coming onto an existing ccuk site revenues from such services are recognized on either a fixed price or a time and materials basis site management and other services consisting of both network monitoring and equipment maintenance are carried out in the uk for a number of emergency service organizations ccuk receives revenues for such services under contracts with original terms of between three and five years such contracts provide fixed prices for network monitoring and variable pricing dependent on the level of equipment maintenance carried out in a given period 

  

costs of operations for site rental in the us primarily consist of 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

for any given tower such costs are relatively fixed over a monthly or an annual time period as such operating costs for owned towers do not generally increase significantly as additional customers are added 

  

costs of operations for broadcast transmission services in the uk consist primarily of employee compensation and related benefits costs utilities rental payments under the sitesharing agreement with ntl circuit costs repairs and maintenance on both transmission equipment and structures property taxes and insurance site rental operating costs in the uk consist primarily of leases of land or rooftop sites property taxes repairs and maintenance employee compensation and related benefits costs utilities and insurance with the exception of land and rooftop leases the majority of such costs are relatively fixed in nature with increases in revenue from new installations on existing sites generally being achieved without a corresponding increase in costs generally leases of land and rooftop sites have a revenue sharing component that averages 20 to 60 of additional revenues added from subsequent tenants 

  

costs of operations for network services consist primarily of employee compensation and related benefits costs subcontractor services consulting fees and other onsite construction and materials costs certain costs incurred in connection with antenna installations are capitalized as property and equipment since they represent assets owned by us as such those costs are not included in our results of operations in the year incurred but rather will be charged to depreciation expense over the life of the assets 

  

general and administrative expenses consist primarily of 

  

   

   

   

   

   

corporate development expenses represent costs incurred in connection with acquisitions and development of new business initiatives these expenses consist primarily of 

  

   

   

   

depreciation amortization and accretion charges relate to our property and equipment which consists primarily of tower sites broadcast transmission equipment associated buildings construction equipment and vehicles and other intangible assets depreciation of tower sites and broadcast transmission equipment is generally computed with a useful life of 20 years amortization of other intangible assets the value of certain site rental contracts at ccusa is computed with a useful life of 10 years depreciation of buildings is generally computed with useful lives ranging from 20 to 40 years depreciation of construction equipment and vehicles is generally computed with useful lives of 10 years and 5 years respectively 

  

we have various transactions recorded in our financial statements as described below that are nonrecurring in nature as such our results of operations for the year ended december 31 2003 are not comparable to the year ended december 31 2002 and the results for the year ended december 31 2002 are not comparable to the year ended december 31 2001 

  

during 2002 us wireless carriers developed significantly fewer new communications sites than were developed in 2001 as a result the pace at which we were able to add new tenants to our sites decreased by approximately 40 during 2002 while the total number of new additions on our towers decreased for the first half of 2003 as compared to the first half of 2002 the rate of new tenant additions during the second half of 2003 was approximately constant with the rate of new additions that we experienced during the second half of 2002 during the second half of 2003 we began to see signs of increased activity in the form of additional applications for our us sites by wireless carriers while there can be no assurances that these applications will result in additional tenant additions to our towers we believe this increase in expressions of interest reflects a renewed focus by our us carriers on the quality of their wireless networks 

  

a summary of site rental and broadcast transmission revenues by country is as follows 

  

   

network services revenues have also been adversely impacted in the us due to reduced antenna installation activity related to the decrease in new tenants along with our strategic decision to reduce our us network services offerings to primarily the management of antenna installations on our sites network services revenues declined as a percentage of our total revenues during 2002 and 2003 and we expect such decline as a percentage of total revenues to continue in the foreseeable future 

  

the following information is derived from our historical consolidated statements of operations for the periods indicated 

  

   

comparison of years ended december 31 2003 and 2002—consolidated 

  

site rental and broadcast transmission revenues for 2003 were 7868 million an increase of 1089 million or 161 from 2002 of this increase 220 million was attributable to ccusa 743 million was attributable to ccuk 32 million was attributable to ccal and 95 million was attributable to crown atlantic network services and other revenues for 2003 were 1436 million a decrease of 801 million from 2002 this decrease was primarily attributable to 

  

   

   

   

   

total revenues for 2003 were 9303 million a net increase of 288 million from 2002 the increases in site rental and broadcast transmission revenues reflect the new tenant additions on our tower sites contractual escalations on existing leases and a full year of digital broadcast transmission revenues from freeview the increases or decreases in network services and other revenues reflect fluctuations in demand for antenna installations from our tenants along with our strategic decision to reduce our us network services offerings to primarily the management of antenna installations on our sites we expect that network services and other revenues will continue to decline as a percentage of total revenues for ccusa and crown atlantic 

  

site rental and broadcast transmission costs of operations for 2003 were 3075 million an increase of 375 million from 2002 of this increase 41 million was attributable to ccusa 308 million was attributable to ccuk 18 million was attributable to ccal and 08 million was attributable to crown atlantic network services and other costs of operations for 2003 were 1103 million a decrease of 659 million from 2002 this decrease was primarily attributable to 

  

   

   

   

   

total costs of operations for 2003 were 4178 million a net decrease of 284 million from 2002 gross margins net revenues less costs of operations for site rental and broadcast transmission as a percentage of site rental and broadcast transmission revenues increased to 609 for 2003 from 602 for 2002 because of higher margins from the ccusa ccuk and crown atlantic operations partially offset by lower margins from the ccal operations gross margins for network services and other as a percentage of network services and other revenues increased to 232 for 2003 from 212 for 2002 because of higher margins from the ccusa ccal and crown atlantic operations partially offset by lower margins from the ccuk operations 

  

the growth of ccuk’s operations relative to ccusa and crown atlantic has increased the impact that ccuk’s margins have on our consolidated results and ccuk’s margins tend to be lower than our us businesses due to the higher costs associated with our uk broadcast business and the costs from the revenue sharing component of leases for land and rooftop sites in the uk such costs for revenue sharing will increase on certain sites to be developed in the future under amended agreements with british telecom see “—liquidity and capital resources” 

  

general and administrative expenses for 2003 were 949 million an increase of 07 million from 2002 this increase was primarily attributable to 

  

   

   

   

   

   

general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues decreased to 102 for 2003 from 105 for 2002 primarily because of lower overhead costs as a percentage of revenues for ccuk ccuk’s general and administrative expenses for 2002 include a charge of approximately 26 million for a bad debt provision related to the liquidation of itv digital a former customer of ccuk 

  

corporate development expenses for 2003 were 56 million compared to 75 million for 2002 this decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in salary costs

liquidity and capital resources 

  

since inception we have generally funded our activities other than acquisitions and investments through cash provided by operations excess proceeds from contributions of equity capital and borrowings under our senior credit facilities we have financed acquisitions and investments with the proceeds from equity contributions borrowings under our senior credit facilities and issuances of debt securities 

  

our goal is to maximize net cash from operating activities and fund all capital spending and debt service from our operating cash flow without reliance on additional borrowing or the use of our cash however due to the risk factors outlined in “item 1 business—risk factors” there can be no assurance that this will be possible as part of our strategy to achieve increases in net cash from operating activities we seek to lower our interest expense by reducing outstanding debt balances or lowering interest rates such reductions can be made either by using a portion of our existing cash balances to purchase our debt securities or with attractive refinancing opportunities 

  

our business strategy contemplates substantial capital expenditures although significantly reduced from previous years’ levels in connection with the further improvement maintenance and selective expansion of our existing tower portfolios during 2004 we expect that the majority of our discretionary capital expenditures will occur at ccuk in connection with the development of the sites acquired from british telecom and selected expansion of certain broadcast infrastructure for additional services 

  

during 2002 and 2003 we made substantial progress in our efforts to 1 maximize net cash from operating activities and 2 make efficient use of our capital spending a summary of our net cash provided by operating activities and capital expenditures both amounts from our consolidated statement of cash flows is as follows 

  

   

the increase in net cash from operating activities for 2003 as compared to 2002 is largely due to growth in our core site leasing and broadcast business partially offset by 1 approximately 164 million in cash interest payments on the 10 5  8  discount notes which did not begin until may of 2003 2 the acceleration of approximately 116 million in interest payments due to the redemption of the ccuk bonds which occurred in november of 2003 and 3 the continued decline in our network services business during 2002 and 2003 we experienced improved collections of accounts receivable and other improvements in working capital as compared to prior years however there can be no assurance that accounts receivable collections or working capital improvements will continue to have a positive impact on net cash provided by operating activities furthermore changes in working capital and particularly changes in accrued interest can have a dramatic impact on our net cash from operating activities for interim periods largely due to the timing of interest payments on our various senior notes issues 

  

for the year ending december 31 2004 we currently expect that our net cash provided by operating activities will be between approximately 2350 million and 2500 million we expect that our net cash from operating activities will be positively impacted by continued growth in our core site leasing and broadcast business in 2004 but we do not expect to benefit from improvements in working capital to the same extent as in 2003 for the year ending december 31 2004 we currently expect that our cash interest payments will total approximately 2163 million compared to approximately 2139 million for the year ended december 31 2003 

  

capital expenditures were 1189 million for the year ended december 31 2003 of which 153 million were for ccusa 915 million were for ccuk 34 million were for ccal 85 million were for crown atlantic and 02 million were for ccic during 2004 we expect to spend approximately 200 million to 400 million for tower improvements including enhancements to the structural capacity of our towers in order to support the anticipated leasing and approximately 400 million for maintenance activities for the year ending december 31 2004 we currently expect that our total capital expenditures will be between approximately 700 million and 900 million as such we expect that our capital expenditures for this period will be fully funded by net cash from operating activities as discussed above 

  

in march of 2003 ccuk paid £212 million approximately 332 million of the final £500 million site access fee payment due to british telecom in addition ccuk had reached agreement with british telecom to defer the remaining £288 million approximately 479 million payment until the end of october 2003 in october of 2003 ccuk reached agreement to amend certain provisions of its agreements with british telecom under the terms of these amended agreements ccuk was not required to make the remaining £288 million site access fee payment to british telecom the revised agreements allow ccuk to continue to develop british telecom exchange sites with british telecom funding the common area capital expenditures required to develop the sites and ccuk receiving 40 of the revenue of all colocated tenants on the sites developed no revisions were made to the financial arrangements associated with the british telecom sites developed prior to october 1 2003 

  

we expect that the construction of new tower sites primarily improvements to ccuk’s rooftop sites will continue to have an impact on our liquidity we expect that once integrated these new towers will have a positive impact on liquidity but will require some period of time to offset the initial adverse impact on liquidity in addition we believe that as new towers become operational and we begin to add tenants they should result in a longterm increase in liquidity our decisions regarding the construction of new towers are discretionary and depend upon expectations of achieving acceptable rates of return given current market conditions such decisions are influenced by the availability of capital and expected returns on alternative investments we have increased our minimum acceptable level for internal rates of return on new tower builds given current market conditions and expect to continue to decrease the number of new towers built in the foreseeable future 

  

during the year ended december 31 2003 we disposed of two office buildings and received proceeds of approximately 117 million in addition we paid approximately 126 million to the federal communications commission for the purchase of 5 mhz of spectrum 

  

to fund the execution of our business strategy we expect to use our available cash balances and cash provided by future operations we do not currently expect to utilize further borrowings available under our us credit facilities in any significant amounts we may have additional cash needs to fund our operations in the future should our financial performance deteriorate we may also have additional cash needs in the future if additional tower acquisitions buildtosuit or other opportunities arise if we do not otherwise have cash available or borrowings 

  

under our credit facilities have otherwise been utilized when our cash need arises we would be forced to seek additional debt or equity financing or to forego the opportunity in the event we determine to seek additional debt or equity financing there can be no assurance that any such financing will be available on commercially acceptable terms or at all or permitted by the terms of our existing indebtedness 

  

as of december 31 2003 we had consolidated cash and cash equivalents of 4624 million including 526 million at ccusa 262 million at ccuk 209 million at ccal 74 million at crown atlantic 1510 million in an unrestricted investment subsidiary and 2043 million at ccic consolidated longterm debt of 34500 million consolidated redeemable preferred stock of 5067 million and consolidated stockholders’ equity of 19844 million on january 7 2004 we utilized approximately 2710 million of our cash to purchase an aggregate of 2451 million in outstanding principal amount of our 9 senior notes and 9 1  2  senior notes including accrued interest thereon as more fully discussed below such purchases were made pursuant to cash tender offers that commenced in december of 2003 

  

for the years ended december 31 2001 2002 and 2003 our net cash provided by used for financing activities was 11093 million 3351 million and 3137 million respectively the amounts for 2002 and 2003 are largely due to financing transactions we have completed in an effort to lower our future cash interest payments and simplify our capital structure following is a summary of significant financing transactions completed in 2003 and january of 2004 

  

in 2003 crown atlantic and ccuk repaid 550 million and 898 million respectively in outstanding borrowings under their credit facilities crown atlantic and ccuk utilized cash provided by their operations to effect these repayments in february of 2004 crown atlantic amended its credit facility to reduce the available borrowings from 3011 million to 2500 million 

  

in march june and september of 2003 we paid our quarterly dividends on the 8 1  4  convertible preferred stock by issuing a total of 18 million shares of our common stock as allowed by the deposit agreement relating to dividend payments on the 8 1  4  convertible preferred stock we repurchased the 18 million shares of common stock from the dividend paying agent for a total of 124 million in cash we utilized cash from an unrestricted investment subsidiary to effect the stock repurchases we may choose to continue such issuances and repurchases of stock in the future in order to avoid further dilution caused by the issuance of common stock as dividends on our preferred stock 

  

from march through october of 2003 we purchased shares of our 12 3  4  exchangeable preferred stock in public market transactions such shares of preferred stock had an aggregate redemption amount and carrying value of 2229 million we utilized 2414 million in cash 94 million from an unrestricted investment subsidiary and 2320 million from ccic to effect these preferred stock purchases the preferred stock purchases resulted in a net loss of 185 million on december 15 2003 we redeemed the remaining outstanding shares of our 12 3  4  exchangeable preferred stock at a price of 106375 of the liquidation preference on the redemption date such remaining shares had an aggregate redemption and liquidation value of 470 million we utilized 500 million of our cash to effect this redemption the redemption resulted in a loss of 30 million which is included in interest and other income expense on our consolidated statement of operations prior to july 1 2003 gains and losses from purchases of our 12 3  4  exchangeable preferred stock were presented as part of dividends on preferred stock in our consolidated statement of operations since that date such gains and losses are presented as part of interest and other income expense due to the adoption of a new accounting standard for mandatorily redeemable financial instruments see “—impact of recently issued accounting standards” the redemption of the 12 3  4  exchangeable preferred stock along with the other 2003 purchases discussed above will result in decreased dividends of approximately 360 million per year 

  

in april and july of 2003 the restrictions expired with respect to the first two thirds of the outstanding restricted common shares that had been issued during the first quarter of 2003 see “—compensation charges related to stock and stock option grants and acquisitions” most of the executives and employees elected to sell a portion of their vested shares in order to pay their minimum respective tax liabilities and we arranged to purchase these shares in order to facilitate the stock sales we purchased approximately 11 million of such shares of common stock approximately 06 million shares at a price of 622 per share and approximately 05 million shares at a price of 988 per share for a total of 90 million in cash we utilized cash from an unrestricted investment subsidiary to effect the stock purchases 

  

in may of 2003 we purchased approximately 51 million shares of our common stock from verizon communications for 310 million in cash see “—joint ventures with verizon communications” 

  

in october of 2003 we purchased debt securities with an aggregate principal amount and carrying value of 182 million in public market transactions we utilized 201 million of our cash to effect these debt purchases the debt purchases resulted in losses of 24 million 

  

on may 30 2003 we announced that we had elected to redeem all of the 10 5  8  discount notes at the contractual redemption price of 105313 of the outstanding principal amount on july 7 2003 we utilized 2555 million of our cash to redeem the 2392 million in outstanding principal amount of the 10 5  8  discount notes including accrued interest thereon of 37 million the redemption resulted in a loss of 189 million consisting of the writeoff of unamortized deferred financing costs 62 million and the redemption premium 127 million such loss is included in interest and other income expense on our consolidated statement of operations the redemption of the 10 5  8  discount notes combined with the issuance of the 4 senior notes as discussed below will result in decreased interest expense of approximately 162 million per year 

  

on july 2 2003 we issued 2300 million aggregate principal amount of our 4 senior notes for proceeds of 2231 million after underwriting discounts of 69 million the proceeds from the sale of these securities were used to fund a portion of the redemption price for the 10 5  8  discount notes as discussed above semiannual interest payments for the 4 senior notes are due on each january 15 and july 15 beginning on january 15 2004 the maturity date of the 4 senior notes is july 15 2010 the 4 senior notes are convertible at the option of the holder in whole or in part at any time into shares of our common stock at a conversion price of 1083 per share of common stock conversion of all of the 4 senior notes would result in the issuance of 212 million shares of our common stock 

  

on october 10 2003 we entered into an amendment of the 2000 credit facility the amended credit agreement consists of two term loan facilities and a revolving line of credit aggregating 16 billion after closing of the amended credit agreement the term a loan had a balance of 1925 million the term b loan had a balance of 11 billion and there were no amounts drawn under the 3500 million revolving line of credit the maturity date of the term b loan was extended to september 30 2010 upon closing of the amended credit agreement we received 7020 million in gross proceeds from the increased term b loan we utilized 1 1000 million of such proceeds to reduce the outstanding borrowings under the term a loan and 2 590 million of such proceeds to repay the remaining amounts borrowed under the ccuk credit facility including accrued interest and fees in addition on november 10 2003 we used approximately 2483 million of such proceeds to redeem the ccuk bonds including accrued interest thereon of approximately 116 million the redemption resulted in a loss of 289 million consisting of the writeoff of unamortized deferred financing costs 38 million and the redemption premium 251 million such loss is included in interest and other income expense on our consolidated statement of operations the remaining proceeds from the increased term b loan were used for general corporate purposes including the purchase of our public debt securities and our 12 3  4  exchangeable preferred stock in connection with the amendment of the 2000 credit facility and the retirement of ccuk’s indebtedness we have designated ccuk as a restricted subsidiary for purposes of the amended credit agreement as well as under our bond indentures 

  

on december 2 2003 we issued 3000 million aggregate principal amount of our 75 senior notes for net proceeds of 2933 million the proceeds from the sale of these securities were used to fund a portion of the purchase price in connection with the cash tender offer for our 10 3  8  discount notes and 11 1  4  discount notes as discussed below on december 11 2003 we issued 3000 million aggregate principal amount of our 75 series b senior notes for net proceeds of 2925 million the proceeds from the sale of these securities were used to fund the purchase price in connection with the cash tender offer for our 9 senior notes and 9 1  2  senior notes as discussed below and for general corporate purposes semiannual interest payments for the 75 senior notes and the 75 series b senior notes are due on each june 1 and december 1 beginning on june 1 2004 the maturity date of the 75 senior notes and the 75 series b senior notes is december 1 2013

the purchase of the tendered 10 3  8  discount notes 11 1  4  discount notes 9 senior notes and 9 1  2  senior notes combined with the issuance of the 75 senior notes and the 75 series b senior notes as discussed above will result in decreased interest payments of approximately 444 million per year when these transactions are combined with 1 the purchases and redemption of the 12 3  4  exchangeable preferred stock 2 the october 2003 purchases of debt securities 3 the redemption of the 10 5  8  discount notes and 4 the issuance of the 4 senior notes all as discussed above our interest payments and preferred stock dividend requirements have decreased by approximately 985 million per year 

  

we seek to allocate our available capital among the investment alternatives that provide the greatest riskadjusted returns given current market conditions as such we may continue to acquire sites build new towers and make improvements to existing towers when the expected returns from such expenditures meet our investment criteria in addition we may continue to utilize a portion of our available cash balances to purchase our own stock either common or preferred or debt securities from time to time as market prices make such investments attractive 

  

as of february 18 2004 our restricted us uk and australian subsidiaries had approximately 3413 million of unused borrowing availability under the amended 2000 credit facility as discussed above as of february 18 2004 crown atlantic had unused borrowing availability under its amended credit facility of approximately 550 million our various credit facilities require our subsidiaries to maintain certain financial covenants and place restrictions on the ability of our subsidiaries to among other things incur debt and liens pay 

  

dividends make capital expenditures undertake transactions with affiliates and make investments these facilities also limit the ability of the borrowing subsidiaries to pay dividends to ccic 

  

the primary factors that determine our subsidiaries’ ability to comply with their debt covenants are 1 their current financial performance as defined in the various credit agreements 2 their levels of indebtedness and 3 their debt service requirements since we do not currently expect that our subsidiaries will need to utilize significant additional borrowings under their credit facilities the primary risk of a debt covenant violation would result from a deterioration of a subsidiary’s financial performance in addition certain of the credit facilities will require that financial performance increase in future years as covenant calculations become more restrictive should a covenant violation occur in the future as a result of a shortfall in financial performance or for any other reason we might be required to make principal payments earlier than currently scheduled and may not have access to additional borrowings under these facilities as long as the covenant violation continues any such early principal payments would have to be made from our existing cash balances 

  

as a holding company ccic will require distributions or dividends from its subsidiaries or will be forced to use its remaining cash balances to fund its debt obligations including interest payments on the notes the terms of the indebtedness of our subsidiaries limit their ability to distribute cash to ccic subject to certain financial covenants the terms of the amended 2000 credit facility permit the distribution of funds to ccic in order for it to pay 1 up to 175 million of its annual corporate overhead expenses and 2 interest payments on its existing indebtedness there can be no assurance however that our subsidiaries will generate sufficient cash from their operations to make all of such permitted distributions as a result we could be required to apply a portion of our remaining cash to fund interest payments on the notes if we do not retain sufficient funds or raise additional funds from any future financing we may not be able to make our interest payments on the notes 

  

if we are unable to refinance our indebtedness or renegotiate the terms of such debt prior to maturity we may not be able to meet our debt service requirements including interest payments on the notes in the future our 4 senior notes our 9 senior notes our 9 1  2  senior notes our 10 3  4  senior notes our 9 3  8  senior notes our 75 senior notes and our 75 series b senior notes require annual cash interest payments of approximately 92 million 24 million 05 million 461 million 382 million 225 million and 225 million respectively prior to may 15 2004 and august 1 2004 the interest expense on our 10 3  8  discount notes and our 11 1  4  discount notes respectively will be comprised solely of the amortization of original issue discount thereafter the 10 3  8  discount notes and the 11 1  4  discount notes will require annual cash interest payments of approximately 13 million and 13 million respectively in addition our us credit facilities require periodic interest payments on amounts borrowed thereunder which amounts are substantial 

  

the following table summarizes our contractual cash obligations as of december 31 2003 

  

      

we have issued letters of credit to various landlords insurers and other parties in connection with certain contingent retirement obligations under various tower site land leases and certain other contractual obligations the letters of credit were issued through one of ccusa’s lenders in amounts aggregating 128 million and expire on various dates through october 2005 

  

our ability to make scheduled payments of principal of or to pay interest on our debt obligations and our ability to refinance any such debt obligations will depend on our future performance which to a certain extent is subject to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control in addition our ability to refinance any indebtedness in the future would depend in part on our maintaining adequate credit ratings from the commercial rating agencies such credit ratings are dependent on all the liquidity and performance factors discussed above as well as general expectations that the rating agencies have regarding the outlook for our business and our industry we anticipate that we may need to refinance a substantial portion of our indebtedness on or prior to its scheduled maturity there can be no assurance that we will be able to effect any required refinancings of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all see “item 1 business—risk factors” 

  

joint ventures with verizon communications 

  

on may 2 2003 we entered into several agreements the “agreements” dated effective may 1 2003 relating to our two joint ventures with verizon communications “verizon” the crown castle atlantic venture “crown atlantic” and the crown castle gt venture “crown castle gt” under the agreements certain termination rights under which verizon could have required us to purchase verizon’s interest in either or both ventures at any time were converted to put and call rights with an extended exercise date of july 1 2007 we also acquired all of verizon’s interest in crown castle gt in exchange for additional interests in crown atlantic and certain other consideration in addition the shares of our common stock previously held by the ventures were distributed to verizon following the transactions we own 100 of crown castle gt and 62755 of crown atlantic further details of the transaction and its accounting treatment are discussed below 

  

pursuant to the agreements we acquired all of verizon’s equity interests in crown castle gt 110 after the distribution of the shares of our common stock from crown castle gt to verizon as discussed below in exchange for consideration consisting of 1 the transfer to a verizon affiliate of a 133 equity interest in crown atlantic with an estimated fair value of 636 million representing consideration for the verizon crown castle gt partner’s interest in the operating assets held by crown castle gt 2 approximately 59 million in cash representing the working capital of crown castle gt allocable to the verizon crown castle gt partner’s interest reduced by the working capital of crown atlantic allocable to the 133 equity interest in crown atlantic transferred to the verizon affiliate and 3 the transfer to a verizon affiliate of approximately 58 tower sites from the two ventures for which our proportion of their estimated fair value aggregated 116 million for the purpose of performing the purchase price allocation the fair value measurement for the exchange of the venture interests was determined based on the current financial performance of crown castle gt’s tower sites using a valuation multiple derived from the current market performance of our common stock 

  

pursuant to the agreements crown castle gt distributed 51 million shares of our common stock previously held by crown castle gt to the verizon crown castle gt partner resulting in a reduction in verizon’s interest in crown castle gt by a fixed percentage of 68 the fixed percentage reduction was agreed upon at the time of the formation of crown castle gt we then purchased such shares from verizon at a negotiated price of 6122 per share for 310 million in cash we utilized cash from an unrestricted investment subsidiary to effect this stock purchase 

  

in addition pursuant to the agreements crown atlantic distributed 156 million shares of our common stock previously held by crown atlantic to the verizon crown atlantic partner resulting in a reduction in verizon’s interest in crown atlantic by a fixed percentage of 19 the fixed percentage reduction was agreed upon at the time of the formation of crown atlantic pursuant to the registration rights contained in the crown atlantic formation agreement dated december 8 1998 as amended by the agreements we filed a registration statement relating to the sale of such distributed shares on july 1 2003 such registration statement became effective on july 21 2003 subsequent to that date verizon has sold all of the 156 million shares of our common stock to third parties 

  

we have accounted for the acquisition of the minority interest in crown castle gt using the purchase method in connection with the purchase price allocation for the transaction we recorded 1 a net decrease in the carrying value of our tower sites included in property and equipment of 337 million 2 goodwill of 483 million none 

  

of which is currently expected to be deductible for tax purposes 3 other intangible assets included in deferred financing costs and other assets of 40 million 4 the elimination of minority interest related to crown castle gt of 554 million 5 an increase in minority interest related to crown atlantic of 762 million and 6 a loss on the issuance of the interest in crown atlantic of 81 million included in interest and other income expense on our consolidated statement of operations the net decrease in the carrying value of the tower sites resulted from a purchase price allocation adjustment based on the estimated replacement cost of crown castle gt’s towers along with the net book value of the tower sites transferred to verizon from the two ventures the increase in goodwill resulted primarily from the fair value of the acquired portion of crown castle gt in excess of the related minority interest along with the net decrease in the carrying value of the tower sites the amounts recorded for the net decrease in the carrying value of the tower sites and the increase in other intangible assets represent the proportionate share of such allocated amounts acquired by us from verizon 

  

on or after july 1 2007 the exercise of the put right by verizon or the call right by us will require us to purchase all of verizon’s equity interests in crown atlantic for cash equal to the then fair market value of such interest verizon retains certain protective rights regarding the tower networks held by both crown atlantic and crown castle gt these protective rights will remain in place after the crown atlantic put or call right is exercised the protective rights relate primarily to ensuring verizon wireless’ quiet enjoyment as a tenant on the crown atlantic and crown castle gt sites and such rights terminate should verizon wireless cease to occupy the sites

during the year ended december 31 2002 we abandoned a portion of our construction in process related to certain open projects cancelled certain buildtosuit agreements and wrote down the value of the related construction in process wrote down the value of certain inventories and wrote down the value of three office buildings as a result we recorded asset writedown charges of 392 million for ccusa 111 million for crown atlantic and 23 million for the corporate office for the year ended december 31 2002 we also recorded asset writedown charges of 32 million for ccuk related to certain inventories and property and equipment 

  

during the year ended december 31 2003 we abandoned an additional portion of our construction in process and certain other assets and recorded asset writedown charges of 98 million for ccusa and 45 million for crown atlantic we will continue to evaluate the carrying value of our goodwill and our property and equipment as required by sfas 142 and sfas 144 implicit in the determination of fair value for such longlived assets are certain assumptions regarding the future leasing of our communication sites should future business conditions require the amendment of previous assumptions we may abandon additional portions of our construction in process if the leasing potential of open projects is determined to be below acceptable levels as a result our assets could be deemed impaired and a charge to earnings would be required 

  

compensation charges related to stock and stock option grants and acquisitions 

  

we have recognized noncash general and administrative compensation charges related to certain stock options granted to employees and executives prior to our ipo such charges amounted to approximately 14 million for each of the two years ended december 31 2002 

  

we have issued shares of our common stock and stock options in connection with an acquisition by ccuk such shares and options were deemed to be compensation to the former shareholders of the acquired company who remained employed by us as a result ccuk is recognizing noncash general and administrative compensation charges of approximately 84 million over a fiveyear period ending in 2005 

  

we have issued shares of our common stock in connection with an acquisition by ccusa a portion of such shares were deemed to be compensation to the former shareholders of the acquired company who remained employed by us as a result ccusa has recognized noncash general and administrative compensation charges of approximately 59 million over a threeyear period ended in 2003 

  

on january 1 2003 we adopted the fair value method of accounting using the “prospective method” of transition for stockbased employee compensation awards granted on or after that date see “—impact of recently issued accounting standards” as a result we are recognizing noncash general and administrative compensation charges for stock options granted in 2003 such charges will amount to approximately 08 million over a fiveyear period ending in 2008 

  

in february of 2003 we issued 105000 shares of common stock to the nonexecutive members of our board of directors as part of their annual compensation for services on the board these shares had a grantdate fair value of 395 per share in connection with these shares we recognized noncash general and administrative compensation charges of approximately 04 million for the year ended december 31 2003 

  

during the first quarter of 2003 we granted approximately 58 million shares of restricted common stock to our executives and certain employees these restricted shares had a weightedaverage grantdate fair value of 415 per share determined based on the closing market price of our common stock on the grant dates the restrictions on the shares will expire in various annual amounts over the vesting period of five years with provisions for accelerated vesting based on the market performance of our common stock in connection with restricted shares we are recognizing noncash general and administrative compensation charges of approximately 240 million over the vesting period such charges will be reduced in the event that any of the restricted shares are forfeited before they become vested at december 31 2003 future charges related to the restricted shares amounted to 81 million presented as unearned stock compensation in stockholders’ equity on our consolidated balance sheet 

  

on april 29 2003 the market performance of our common stock reached the first target level for accelerated vesting of the restricted common shares that had been issued during the first quarter of 2003 this first target level was reached when the market price of our common stock closed at or above 554 per share for twenty consecutive trading days as a result the restrictions expired with respect to one third of such outstanding shares during the second quarter of 2003 the acceleration of the vesting for these shares resulted in the recognition of noncash general and administrative compensation charges of approximately 73 million for the year ended december 31 2003 

  

on july 30 2003 the market performance of our common stock reached the second target level for accelerated vesting of the restricted common shares that had been issued during the first quarter of 2003 this second target level was reached when the market price of our common stock closed at or above 830 per share 150 of the first target level of 554 per share for twenty consecutive trading days as a result the restrictions expired with respect to an additional third of such shares during the third quarter of 2003 the acceleration of the vesting for these shares resulted in the recognition of noncash general and administrative compensation charges of approximately 78 million for the year ended december 31 2003 in order to reach the third and final target level for accelerated vesting of the restricted common shares that had been issued during the first quarter of 2003 the market price of our common stock would have to close at or above 1245 per share 150 of the second target level of 830 per share for twenty consecutive trading days 

  

in february of 2004 we issued 35400 shares of common stock to the nonexecutive members of our board of directors as part of their annual compensation for services on the board these shares have a grantdate fair value of 1185 per share in connection with these shares we will recognize noncash general and administrative compensation charges of approximately 04 million for the first quarter of 2004 

  

impact of recently issued accounting standards 

  

in june 2001 the financial accounting standards board the “fasb” issued statement of financial accounting standards no 143 accounting for asset retirement obligations “sfas 143” sfas 143 addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible longlived assets and the related asset retirement costs the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation is to be recognized in the period in which it is incurred and can be reasonably estimated such asset retirement costs are to be capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the related longlived asset and depreciated over the asset’s estimated useful life fair value estimates of liabilities for asset retirement obligations will generally involve discounted future cash flows periodic accretion of such liabilities due to the passage of time is to be recorded as an operating expense the provisions of sfas 143 were effective for fiscal years beginning after june 15 2002 with initial application as of the beginning of the fiscal year we adopted the requirements of sfas 143 as of january 1 2003 the adoption of sfas 143 resulted in the recognition of liabilities amounting to 41 million for contingent retirement obligations under certain tower site land leases included in other longterm liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet the recognition of asset retirement costs amounting to 14 million included in property and equipment on our consolidated balance sheet and the recognition of a charge for the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle amounting to 20 million net of related income tax benefits of 06 million accretion expense related to liabilities for contingent retirement obligations included in depreciation amortization and accretion on our consolidated statement of operations amounted to 04 million for the year ended december 31 2003 at december 31 2003 liabilities for contingent retirement obligations amounted to 48 million if the provisions of sfas 143 had been applied during all periods presented liabilities for contingent retirement obligations would have amounted to 30 million and 33 million at january 1 2001 and december 31 2001 respectively 

  

in november 2002 the fasb’s emerging issues task force released its final consensus on issue no 0021 “ revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables ” “eitf 0021” eitf 0021 addresses certain aspects of the accounting for arrangements under which multiple revenuegenerating activities will be performed including the determination of whether an arrangement involving multiple deliverables contains more than one unit of accounting the guidance in eitf 0021 is effective for revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after june 15 2003 we adopted the provisions of eitf 0021 as of july 1 2003 and such adoption did not have a significant effect on our consolidated financial statements 

  

in december 2002 the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 148 accounting for stockbased compensation—transition and disclosure “sfas 148” sfas 148 amends statement of financial accounting standards no 123 accounting for stockbased compensation “sfas 123” to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value method of accounting for stockbased employee compensation in addition sfas 148 amends the provisions of sfas 123 to require more prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stockbased employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results of operations we adopted the disclosure requirements of sfas 148 as of december 31 2002 on january 1 2003 we adopted the fair value method of accounting for stockbased employee compensation using the “prospective” method of transition as provided by sfas 148 under this transition method we will recognize compensation cost for all employee awards granted on or after january 1 2003 the adoption of this new accounting method did not have a significant effect on our consolidated financial statements 

  

in january 2003 the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 46 consolidation of variable interest entities “fin 46” in december 2003 the fasb issued a revised version of fin 46 fin 46 clarifies existing accounting literature regarding the consolidation of entities in which a company holds a “controlling financial interest” a majority voting interest in an entity has generally been considered indicative of a controlling financial interest fin 46 specifies other factors “variable interests” which must be considered when determining whether a company holds a controlling financial interest in and therefore must consolidate an entity “variable interest entities” the provisions of fin 46 as revised are effective for the first reporting period ending after march 15 2004 we will adopt the provisions of fin 46 as of march 31 2004 and do not expect that such adoption will have a significant effect on our consolidated financial statements 

  

in may 2003 the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 150 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity “sfas 150” sfas 150 requires that 

  

mandatorily redeemable financial instruments issued in the form of shares be classified as liabilities and specifies certain measurement and disclosure requirements for such instruments the provisions of sfas 150 were effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june 15 2003 we adopted the requirements of sfas 150 as of july 1 2003 we determined that 1 our 12 3  4  exchangeable preferred stock was to be reclassified as a liability upon adoption of sfas 150 and 2 our 8 1  4  convertible preferred stock and our 625 convertible preferred stock were not to be reclassified as liabilities since the conversion features caused them to be contingently redeemable rather than mandatorily redeemable financial instruments in addition the dividends on our 12 3  4  exchangeable preferred stock are included in interest expense on our consolidated statement of operations beginning on july 1 2003 

  

in december 2003 the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 132 revised 2003 employers’ disclosures about pensions and other postretirement benefits “sfas 132r” sfas 132r revises the required disclosures about pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans sfas 132r replaces statement of financial accounting standards no 132 employers’ disclosures about pensions and other postretirement benefits which was originally issued in february 1998 but retains its disclosure requirements sfas 132r requires additional disclosures about the assets obligations cash flows and net periodic benefit cost of defined benefit pension plans and requires that certain disclosures be included in interim financial statements sfas 132r will apply to our disclosures for ccuk’s defined benefit plan the provisions of sfas 132r are generally effective for fiscal years ending after december 15 2003 however many of the new disclosure requirements for information about foreign plans as well as information about future benefit payments do not become effective until fiscal years ending after june 15 2004 the interimperiod disclosure requirements of sfas 132r are effective for interim periods beginning after december 15 2003 we have adopted the annual reporting requirements of sfas 132r as of december 31 2003 except for the disclosure about future benefit payments we will provide such disclosure about future benefit payments as of december 31 2004 we will adopt the interimperiod reporting requirements as of march 31 2004

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

as a result of our international operating investing and financing activities we are exposed to market risks which include changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates which may adversely affect our results 

  

of operations and financial position in attempting to minimize the risks andor costs associated with such activities we seek to manage exposure to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates where economically prudent to do so 

  

certain of the financial instruments we have used to obtain capital are subject to market risks from fluctuations in market interest rates the majority of our financial instruments however are longterm fixed interest rate notes and debentures a fluctuation in market interest rates of one percentage point in 2004 would impact our interest expense by approximately 140 million as of december 31 2003 we have approximately 14848 million of floating rate indebtedness of which 838 million has been effectively converted to fixed rate indebtedness through the use of an interest rate swap agreement 

  

the majority of our foreign currency transactions are denominated in the british pound sterling or the australian dollar which are the functional currencies of ccuk and ccal respectively as a result of ccuk’s and ccal’s transactions being denominated and settled in such functional currencies the risks associated with currency fluctuations are primarily associated with foreign currency translation adjustments however since we are now able to access cash distributions from ccuk upon its inclusion in our restricted borrowing group we are subject to currency fluctuations on any such amounts distributed see “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—liquidity and capital resources” we do not currently hedge against foreign currency translation risks and do not currently believe that foreign currency exchange risk is significant to our operations 

  

the foreign currency exchange rates used to translate the 2003 financial statements for ccuk and ccal were as follows

item 1 business

overview

   we own operate and lease towers including colocatable rooftop sites and
transmission networks for wireless communications and broadcast transmission
companies we engage in such activities through a variety of structures
including subleasing and management arrangements as of december 31 2002 we
owned leased or managed 15578 towers including 10794 sites in the united
states and puerto rico 3397 sites in the united kingdom and 1387 sites in
australia our customers currently include many of the worlds major wireless
communications and broadcast companies including verizon cingular nextel
tmobile sprint pcs att wireless singtel optus optus vodafone o2
hutchison 3g uk limited hutchison 3g orange british sky broadcasting
group plc bskyb national transcommunications limited ntl and the
british broadcasting corporation bbc

   our strategy is to increase our revenue by increasing the utilization of our
sites by wireless and broadcast companies and where appropriate to continue
to build acquire and operate new towers and wireless and transmission networks
and infrastructure through opportunities created by

     the transfer to third parties or outsourcing of tower ownership and
      management by major wireless carriers

     the need for existing wireless carriers to expand coverage and improve
      network capacity

     the additional demand for towers and wireless infrastructure created by
      new entrants into the wireless communications industry and

     the introduction of wireless technologies including broadband data and
      third generation 3g technology

   our main businesses are leasing including via licensing antenna space on
wireless and broadcast towers that can accommodate multiple tenants
colocation and operating analog and digital broadcast transmission
networks and wireless networks a key component of our strategy is to promote
sharing of wireless towers and broadcast transmission infrastructure we also
provide certain network services relating to tower or other wireless
infrastructure for our customers including project management of antenna
installations

   during 2002 the rate of new tenant additions to our towers decreased by
approximately 40 from 2001 network services revenues have also been adversely
impacted in the us due to reduced antenna installation activity related to
the decrease in new tenants network services revenues declined as a percentage
of our total revenue during 2002 and we expect such decline to continue in the
foreseeable future

   our primary business in the united states is the leasing of antenna space on
our sites to wireless carriers our tower portfolio consists primarily of
towers in various metropolitan areas as of december 31 2002 526 of our
towers were located in the 50 largest basic trading areas or btas in the
us and 713 of our towers were located in the 100 largest btas see
businessthe companyus operations

   our primary businesses in the united kingdom which is conducted through our
wholly owned subsidiary crown castle uk limited or ccuk are the operation
of television and radio broadcast transmission networks including licenses to
use certain spectrum and the leasing of antenna space to wireless carriers
following our 1997 acquisition of the bbcs broadcast and tower infrastructure
we were awarded longterm contracts to provide the bbc and other broadcasters
analog and digital transmission services we also lease antenna space to
wireless operators and broadcasters in the uk on the towers we acquired from
the bbc in addition we lease space to wireless operators on towers that we
acquired from wireless carriers or that we have

british telecom bt in 2002 ccuk was granted spectrum licenses with
respect to two digital terrestrial television dtt multiplexes in the uk
and on october 30 2002 ccuk in conjunction with the bbc and bskyb launched
a multichannel digital terrestrial television and radio broadcasting service
in the uk under the brand freeview see businessthe companyuk

australia pty limited or ccal is the leasing of antenna space to wireless
carriers ccal is owned 776 by us and 224 by permanent nominees aust ltd
on behalf of a group of professional and institutional investors led by jump
capital limited we currently operate 1387 towers in australia see

   we believe our towers are attractive to a diverse range of wireless
communications industries including personal communications services pcs

customers in australia are optus vodafone australia hutchison and telstra

growth strategy

   our objective is to become the leading owner and operator of towers
transmission networks and other infrastructure for wireless communications and
broadcasting we believe our experience in expanding and marketing our towers
as well as our experience in owning and operating analog and digital
transmission networks positions us to accomplish this objective the key
elements of our business strategy are to

     grow revenue organically we are seeking to increase the utilization of
      our communications sites by increasing the number of antenna leases on
      our owned and managed communications sites many of our towers have
      capacity available for additional antenna space rental we believe there
      is demand for such colocation capacity both from existing carriers and
      broadcasters and from new carriers and broadcasters though the growth of
      such demand has significantly decreased we intend to continue to use
      targeted sales and marketing techniques to increase utilization of and
      investment return on our towers during 2002 wireless carriers
      significantly reduced the number of antennas they added to sites making
      our objective of growing revenue organically more challenging

     grow margins we are seeking to take advantage of the operating leverage
      afforded by the relatively fixed nature of the operating costs associated
      with our site rental business the majority of the operating costs of our
      site rental business consist of ground lease expense property taxes
      repair and maintenance utilities and salaries which tend to escalate at
      approximately the rate of inflation consequently if increased
      utilization of tower capacity is achieved at low incremental cost our
      site rental business should experience operating margin expansion

     allocate capital efficiently we are focused on the efficient utilization
      of capital we may seek to expand our existing tower portfolios through
      the selective acquisition and build of strategically located towers that
      satisfy certain investment criteria and are complementary to our tower
      portfolios with respect to tower acquisitions such transactions may
      include acquisitions of sites from major wireless carriers or other tower
      companies through direct acquisitions tower exchanges joint ventures or
      other means with respect to tower builds we may selectively build new
      towers for wireless carriers as they expand and fill in their service
      areas and deploy new technologies requiring additional communications
      sites our decisions to invest additional capital in selective
      acquisitions or build activities are generally based upon whether such
      investments exhibit sufficient colocation revenue potential to achieve
      our riskadjusted return on investment hurdle rates we may also allocate
      capital to certain strategic adjacent activities that satisfy investment
      return criteria or complement our tower portfolios from time to time we
      may sell or swap certain of our towers or other assets as opportunities
      arise in addition we may use some of our capital to acquire our debt
      and equity securities when such acquisitions appear economically viable
      and capital efficient

                                      2

     extend revenue around our existing assets we are seeking to leverage our
      assets and the skills of our personnel in the us the uk and
      australia with our wireless communications and broadcast transmission
      network design and radio frequency engineering expertise we are
      positioned to extend the products and services we offer beyond the
      leasing of tower space to other potentially shareable activities such as
      antenna and base station maintenance shared antennas shared microwave
      backhaul and network monitoring in addition as evidenced by our recent
      acquisition of dtt licenses and the launch of freeview in the uk we
      are pursuing other strategic opportunities including the possible
      opportunistic acquisition of spectrum licenses which are complementary
      to our existing assets and may provide revenue growth

   we operate our business through our subsidiaries primarily in three
geographic areasthe united states the united kingdom and australia we

address the applicable payment obligations as of december 31 2002 assuming
the distribution of the shares of common stock held by the ventures to the
verizon communications partner the interest of the verizon communications
partner in the gte venture and the bell atlantic mobile venture would have been
approximately 110 and 241 respectively as payment to our venture partner
the dissolution of the gte venture would require us to deliver cash and the
dissolution of the bell atlantic mobile venture would require us to deliver
cash or common stock at our option such payments may negatively impact our
liquidity or cause dilution of our common stock additional information
regarding the venture dissolution terms can be found in the text of our prior
filings with the sec and in the relevant venture agreements which have been
filed as exhibits to certain of our prior sec filings we are currently in
discussions with verizon communications regarding certain amendments to the
venture agreements with respect to the procedures payments and other aspects
of the dissolution provisions relating to the ventures including a potential
deferral of dissolution or payments due upon dissolution there can be no
assurances as to the outcome of these discussions

   during the third quarter of 2002 each of our ventures with verizon
communications negotiated a mutual consent to terminate its buildtosuit
commitments with verizon and we negotiated a mutual consent to terminate our
buildtosuit commitments with cingular such agreement terminations eliminated
any requirement to build additional towers for either carrier as a part of the
buildtosuit terminations we sold certain tower construction projects for
approximately 229 million in cash asset writedown charges of approximately
64 million were recorded during 2002 related to these projects

   we plan to continue to selectively build new towers which meet certain
economic criteria on a limited basis in areas where carriers fail to transmit
or drop signals in their coverage areas to reduce risk and speculation we now
generally look for sites with multiple tenant demand and obtain lease
commitments from wireless carriers prior to building a tower further the
towers are constructed to accomodate multiple tenants in order to obviate the
need for expensive and time consuming upgrades saving capital and time for
carriers

   site rental

   in the us we rent antenna space on our towers to a variety of carriers
operating cellular personal communication services specialized mobile radio
enhanced specialized mobile radio paging and other networks

   we generally receive monthly rental payments from customers payable under
site leases and we also receive fees for managing the installation of
customers equipment and antennas on certain of our sites in the us the new
leases typically entered into by us have original terms of five years with
three or four optional renewal periods of five years each and provide for
annual price increases based primarily on a consumer price index subject to
certain caps the lease agreements relating to tower network acquisitions
generally have a base term of 10 years with multiple renewal options each
typically ranging from five to ten years we have existing master lease
agreements with most major wireless carriers including att wireless verizon
tmobile nextel and sprint pcs which provide certain terms including
economic terms that govern leases on our towers entered into by such parties
during the term of their master lease agreements

   the average monthly rental payment of a new tenant added to a tower varies
among the different regions in the us and the type of service being provided
by the tenant with broadband tenants such as personal communications
services paying more than narrowband tenants such as paging primarily as a
result of the physical size of the antenna installation in addition we also
routinely receive rental payment increases in connection with lease amendments
which authorize carriers to add additional antennas or other equipment to sites
on which they already have equipment pursuant to preexisting lease agreements

   we have site rental opportunities in connection with our larger tower
acquisition transactions as a result of the fact that such transactions
typically involve a master lease agreement of some type with the selling or
transferring carrier and the opportunity to lease additional space to other
carriers for example in connection with each of the joint ventures with
verizon communications we entered into a master lease agreement under which
its domestic wireless businesses lease antenna space on the towers transferred
to the ventures further in connection with the powertel bellsouth mobility
and bellsouth dcs transactions we entered into agreements under which the
transferring carriers occupy space on the towers transferred to us in each of
these transactions we are permitted to lease additional space on the towers to
third parties

   network services

   we design build and operate our own communication sites on a limited basis
during 2002 we slowed this activity significantly and expect to build less
than 20 towers in the us in 2003 we also provide network services such as
network design and site selection site acquisition site development and
project management of antenna installations our customers are typically
charged for such services on a fixed price contract or a time and materials
basis while we maintain network design services primarily to support the
location and construction of our multiple tenant towers we do from time to
time provide network design and site selection services to carriers and other
customers on a consulting contract basis in addition we have engaged in site
acquisition services for our own purposes and for third parties we generally
set prices for each site development

                                      5

page

or project management service separately and we may negotiate fees on
individual sites or for groups of sites we manage the installation of antenna
systems for our cellular personal communications services specialized mobile
radio enhanced specialized mobile radio microwave and paging customers

   during 2002 network services revenues were adversely impacted in the us
due to reduced antenna installation activity related to a decrease in new
tenant leases and our strategic decision to reduce our service offerings to
primarily the management of antenna installations on our sites and radio
frequency planning and testing network services revenue declined as a
percentage of our total revenues during 2002 and we expect such decline to
continue in the foreseeable future

   significant contracts

   we have many agreements with telecommunications providers in the us
including leases site management contracts and independent contractor
agreements we currently have significant contracts with most of the major
wireless carriers among others

   customers

   in both our site rental and network services businesses we work with a
number of customers in a variety of businesses including cellular personal
communications services enhanced specialized mobile radio and paging we work
primarily with large national carriers such as verizon cingular att

activities and call on existing and prospective customers

   competition

   in the us we compete with other independent tower owners which also
provide site rental and network services wireless carriers which own and
operate their own tower networks broadcasters and building owners that lease
antenna space primarily on colocatable rooftop sites and other potential
competitors such as utilities and outdoor advertisers some of which have
already entered the tower industry wireless carriers that own and operate
their own tower networks generally are substantially larger and have greater
financial resources than we have we believe that tower location capacity
quality of service and deployment speed have been and will continue to be the
most significant competitive factors affecting tower rental companies

   the following is a list of some of the larger independent tower companies
that we compete with in the us american tower corp spectrasite pinnacle
towers and sba communications we also compete with sprint sites usa a
division of sprint that markets and manages sprints sites and towers
significant additional site rental competition comes from the leasing of
rooftops and other alternative sites for antennas

   competitors in the network services business include bechtel general
dynamics lucent wireless facilities inc sba communications and whalen 
company a subsidiary of tetra tech inc in 2002 we made a strategic
decision to reduce our service offerings to primarily management of antenna
installations on our sites and radio frequency planning and testing we believe
that carriers base their decisions on the outsourcing of network services on
criteria such as a companys experience track record local reputation price
and time for completion of a project

   we own and operate through ccuk one of the worlds most established
broadcast television and radio transmission networks in addition to providing
transmission services we also lease antenna space on our 3397 communications
sites in the united kingdom to various communications service providers
including tmobile o2 orange hutchison 3g and vodafone and provide
telecommunications network installation and maintenance services and
engineering consulting services we provide transmission services for four of
the six digital terrestrial television multiplexes in the uk two bbc analog

first digital audio broadcast service in the uk five bbc regional radio
services for scotland wales and northern ireland 38 local bbc radio stations
and two national commercial radio services through our network of transmitters
which reach 994 of the uk population these transmitters are located on
approximately 1300 sites more than half of which we own or control and the
balance of which are either licensed to us under a sitesharing agreement with
ntl or other third party site operators in april 2001 we launched a new
wireless carrier network service for tmobile previously one 2 one in
northern ireland in 2002 ccuk was granted spectrum licenses with respect to
two dtt multiplexes in the uk and on october 30 2002 ccuk together with

   our core revenue generating activity in the uk is the analog and digital
terrestrial transmission of radio and television programs broadcast by the bbc
ccuks transmission business which was formerly owned by the bbc was
privatized under the broadcasting act 1996 and sold to ccuk in february 1997
at the time the bbc home service transmission business was acquired ccuk
entered into a 10year transmission contract with the bbc for the provision of
terrestrial analog television and analog and digital radio transmission
services in the uk digital television contracts were added in 1998 and 2002
as described below for the 12 months ended december 31 2002 approximately
337 of ccuks consolidated revenues were derived from the provision of
transmission services to the bbc

   at december 31 2002 we owned or managed 3397 sites in the uk our sites
are located throughout england wales scotland and northern ireland

   we expect to expand our existing portfolio in the uk by building and
acquiring additional sites we anticipate that most of these new sites will be
developed on bt sites under our agreement with bt see businessthe
companyuk operationssignificant contractsbritish telecom agreement we
believe our existing network of sites and towers encompasses many of the most
desirable site locations in the uk for wireless communications however due
to the shorter range over which telecommunications signals carry as compared
to broadcast signals wireless communications providers require a denser
portfolio of sites to cover a given area

   in march 1999 ccuk completed the one 2 one now part of tmobile
transaction through this transaction ccuk has added an aggregate of 1672
towers including towers built pursuant to a buildtosuit agreement with
tmobile to its portfolio these towers represent substantially all the towers
in tmobiles nationwide wireless network in the uk these towers form part of
ccuks nationwide network of sites and towers to be marketed to wireless
carriers in the united kingdom see businessthe companyuk
operationssignificant contractstmobile northern ireland network

   in november 2000 ccuk entered into an agreement with bt to lease space on
as many as 4000 bt sites throughout the uk these sites are principally
rooftop facilities owned by bt in urban areas as of december 31 2002 we had
developed 648 sites under this agreement in april 2002 ccuk reached agreement
with bt to defer until march 2003 payment of pounds50 million approximately
805 million which had been due march 2002 from ccuk to bt under this
agreement we are currently in discussions with bt regarding certain amendments
to this agreement including the further deferral or reduction of this payment
and a reduction of the number of bt sites acquired there can be no assurances
as to the outcome of these discussions see businessthe companyuk
operationssignificant contractsbritish telecom agreement

   in february 2001 ccuk signed an agreement with hutchison 3g whereby
hutchison 3g would lease space on a minimum of 4000 ccuk sites throughout the
uk in addition in february 2001 ccuk signed an initial agreement with its
existing customer o2 previously bt cellnet pursuant to which o2 would lease
additional space on ccuk sites throughout the uk with a minimum take up of
500 additional sites per year for each of the years 2001 2002 and 2003 under
each of these agreements the carrier is disputing the terms of the agreement
and is not currently leasing the required number of sites within the time
period contemplated by the agreement and ccuk is currently in discussions with
the carriers regarding the terms of the agreements and resolution of the
disputed issues there can be no assurances as to the outcome of these
discussions see businessthe companyuk operationssignificant

bbcs analog television and radio programs and certain other related services
including bbc digital radio for an initial 10year term through march 31

analog transmission contract

   in addition to the bbc analog transmission contract we have separate
contracts to provide maintenance and transmission services for two national
commercial radio stations virgin radio and talksport formerly talk radio in
july 2001 the virgin radio contract was renewed for a period expiring april
30 2008 the talksport contract commenced on february 4 1995 and expires on
december 31 2008

   we own all of the transmitter equipment used for broadcasting the bbcs
domestic radio and television programs within the uk whether located on one
of ccuks sites or on an ntl or other thirdparty site as of december 31
2002 ccuk had 3929 transmitters of which 2571 were for television
broadcasting and the remainder were for radio

   a few of our most powerful television transmitters together cover the
majority of the uk population the coverage achieved by the less powerful
transmitters is relatively low but is important to the bbcs ambition of
attaining universal coverage in the uk this is illustrated by the fact that
one of our analog television transmitters crystal palace provides coverage to
20 of the uk population and the top 16 analog transmitters provide coverage
to 79 of the uk population

   all of our uk transmitters are capable of unmanned operation and are
maintained by mobile maintenance teams from 25 bases located across the uk a
sitesharing agreement provides us with reciprocal access rights to ntls
broadcast transmission sites on which we have equipment

   dtt network in january 2000 we completed the rollout of the 80 station
network required under our contracts with the then current holders including
the bbc and itv digital of four of the six licenses issued in the uk for
digital terrestrial television dtt services of these sites 49 are owned or
controlled by us and the remainder are on ntl owned or controlled towers
pursuant to a site sharing arrangement in 2002 following the award of the dtt
licenses formerly held by itv digital itvd to the bbc one license and
ccuk two licenses we upgraded our dtt network to provide a more reliable
signal this upgrade consisted of 1 a change in the radio frequency
modulation scheme and 2 increases to the transmission power at a number of
transmitter sites

   digital transmission and broadcast freeview in 1997 the uk
independent television commission itc awarded itvd three of the five
available commercial digital terrestrial television multiplexes for new
program services from 1999 to march 2002 pursuant to a digital transmission
contract with an original term of twelve years ccuk was responsible for the
transmission of the itvd signal through the ccukowned digital terrestrial
television network to approximately 12 million itvd subscribers in the uk in
april 2002 itvd announced plans to liquidate its assets and returned its dtt
multiplex licenses to the itc prior to the liquidation ccuk earned gross
revenues of approximately pounds194 million 276 million annually under
the itvd transmission contract itvd represented approximately 12 of the 2001
gross revenues of ccuk and approximately 3 of the 2001 consolidated gross
revenues of the company

   following the return of the licenses by itvd the itc conditionally awarded
the license for one multiplex to the bbc and the licenses for two multiplexes
to ccuk no license fees were paid to the uk government with respect to the
award of the multiplex licenses other than an approximately 38000 application
fee per multiplex the licenses were formally granted on august 16 2002 for a
term of 12 years and ccuk has the right to renew the licenses for an
additional term of 12 years subject to satisfaction of certain performance
criteria on october 30 2002 the bbc ccuk and bskyb launched their
multichannel digital tv and radio broadcasting services under the brand
freeview digital tv services ltd dtvsl a costsharing cooperative in
which ccuk the bbc and bskyb are equal shareholders has been created

promote freeview in addition to being the licensed broadcast operator of the
two multiplexes awarded to ccuk ccuk provides the transmission of the dtt
program signals for the two ccuk and two bbc multiplexes through the ccukowned
dtt network

   following the award of the dtt licenses and in connection with the launch of
freeview in august 2002 ccuk entered into an agreement with the bbc to provide
transmission and distribution service for the multiplex awarded to the bbc
also in august 2002 ccuk entered into an agreement with bskyb to provide
transmission distribution and multiplexing service in relation to 75 of the
capacity of one of the ccuk multiplexes both of these agreements are for an
initial period of six years with an option by the bbc and bskyb for an
additional sixyear term in addition ccuk has entered into agreements to
provide transmission distribution and multiplexing services to a number of tv
and radio content providers emap flextech guardian media group mtv oneword
and uktv through the two multiplexes awarded to ccuk agreements with the tv
content providers are also for sixyear terms with renewal options while
agreements with radio providers are generally for shorter terms through such
agreements ccuk is currently transmitting content for such customers with
respect to approximately 90 of its licensed capacity and is currently in
negotiations with content providers with respect to the remaining capacity
ccuk has contracted annual revenues of approximately pounds253 million
407 million for the provision of transmission distribution and
multiplexing services related to the new multiplex licenses in 2003 which
replaces the approximately pounds194 million annual revenues previously
earned from the itvd contract and is in addition to the revenues generated from
the original 1998 bbc digital transmission contract see businessthe
companyuk operationssignificant contracts1998 bbc digital transmission
contract 2002 bbc digital transmission contract and bskyb digital
transmission contract

   ccuk has invested as a result of its previous contract with itvd
substantially all of the capital required to provide the services described
above ccuk is already incurring again by virtue of its previous contract with
itvd a large proportion of the operating costs required to provide these
services including payments to british telecom for distribution circuits and
payments to ntl for site rental since ccuk will offer a more complete
endtoend service to content providers than was provided to itvd ccuk expects
to incur certain additional operating costs including 1 payments to bbcs
technology division for multiplexing services and 2 payments to dtvsl for
promotion and marketing of freeview in 2003 ccuk will incur additional annual
operating expenses of approximately pounds53 million 85 million above
the costs incurred for the provision of broadcast services to itvd

   digital radio dab in addition to our dtt transmission and broadcast
services we currently provide transmission services for digital radio
broadcasts dab in the uk in 1995 the bbc launched over our transmission
network its initial national digital radio service and this service is now
broadcast to approximately 65 of the uk population a license for an
independent national digital radio network was awarded to the digital one
consortium during 1998 in addition local digital radio licenses have been
awarded since 1999 and on july 14 2000 we were awarded a 12 year contract
with switchdigital london limited to provide their london local digital radio
network service since that time ccuk has been awarded two additional 12 year
contracts by other switchdigital consortia covering two areas of scotland
site sharing for other dab multiplexes provides additional revenues at several
other transmission sites

   site rental

   the acquisition of the bbc transmission network provided a valuable initial
portfolio for the location of wireless antennas as of december 31 2002
approximately 310 companies rented antenna space on ccuks 3397 towers these
site rental agreements have normally been for three to 20 years and are
generally subject to rent reviews every three years site sharing customers are
generally charged annually in advance according to rate schedules that are
based on the antenna size and position on the tower our largest site rental
customer in the uk is ntl under the sitesharing agreement and the digital
broadcasting site sharing agreement

                                      10

these site sharing agreements relate to the reciprocal use of sites for the
respective broadcast contracts of ccuk and ntl and are not representative of
the typical wireless colocation tenant see businessthe companyuk
operationssignificant contractssitesharing agreement

   ccuks largest by revenue site rental customers consist mainly of wireless
carriers such as hutchison 3g tmobile o2 orange ntl vodafone and bt
revenues from these nonbbc sources continue to become an increasing portion of
ccuks total uk revenue base we believe that site rental from communication
service providers will increase in line with the expected growth of these
communication services along with the deployment of new technologies such as
3g in the uk

   we have master lease agreements with all of the major uk
telecommunications site users including bt o2 tmobile orange hutchison 3g
and vodafone these agreements typically specify the terms and conditions
including pricing and volume discount plans under which these customers have
access to all sites within our uk portfolio customers submit orders for
specific sites using the standard terms included in the master lease agreements

   network services

   ccuk provides broadcast and telecommunications network services to various
customers in the uk we have engineering and technical staff capable of
meeting the requirements of our current customer base and the challenges of
developing digital technology within the uk ccuk has worked with several
telecommunications operators on design and build projects as they rollout their
networks

   network design and site selection

   in december 1999 ccuk and tmobile entered into an agreement under which
ccuk would establish a turnkey mobile network for tmobile in northern ireland
in april 2001 ccuk launched the network which now covers approximately 985
of the population of northern ireland ccuk provides cell planning
acquisition design build operation and maintenance services related to the
network including ownership of the antenna provisioning of backhaul and
signal monitoring tmobile provides the base stations and holds the spectrum
license the agreement with tmobile is for an initial term of 11 years we
currently own and operate approximately 200 tower sites in northern ireland
and tmobile is a tenant on substantially all of these sites as part of the
network

   in june 2000 ccuk was awarded a contract for the first phase of a
threephase network rollout of europes first commercial 3g network on the isle
of man in march 2001 ccuk was awarded a further contract with manx telecom
for the second and third phases the network comprised of approximately 28
sites was built by nec and siemens for manx telecom a wholly owned subsidiary
of mmo2 and was completed in september 2001 ccuk provided turnkey project
management installation and commissioning of the 3g radio access network
including site planning design build and radio frequency planning service on
the network was launched in december 2001

   site acquisition in the uk we are involved in site acquisition services
for our own purposes and for third parties we recognize that the site
acquisition phase often carries the highest risk for a project to ensure the
greatest possible likelihood of success and timely acquisition we combine a
desktop survey of potential barriers to development with a physical site search
with relevant analyses assessments and where necessary surveys we seek to
utilize our experience in site acquisition and colocation when meeting with
local planning authorities

   site development and antenna installation ccuk provides turnkey network
rollout and deployment services including site design site construction and
installation activity for wireless infrastructure ccuks operations division
provides program and project management through its delivery teams using
project management tools and software the majority of construction activities
are completed through independent contractors experienced in the wireless
telecommunications construction industry operations are located in four

resolve the disputed issues ccuk has also entered into contracts to design and
build infrastructure for customers such as o2 tmobile orange and vodafone
including the turnkey network contract for tmobile in northern ireland

   bbc analog transmission contract ccuk entered into a 10year transmission
contract with the bbc for the provision of terrestrial analog television and
analog and digital radio transmission services in the uk at the time the bbc
home service transmission business was acquired the bbc analog transmission
contract also provides for ccuk to be liable to the bbc for service credits
ie rebates of its charges in the event that certain standards of service
are not attained as a result of what the contract characterizes as accountable
faults or the failure to meet certain response times in relation to making
repairs at certain key sites experience has shown that ccuk is equipped to
meet the bbcs service requirements as demonstrated by the fact that ccuk is
subject to periodic performance reviews and to date has paid no service credit
penalties

   the initial term of the bbc analog transmission contract ends on march 31
2007 thereafter the bbc analog transmission contract may be terminated with
12 months prior notice by either of the parties expiring on march 31 in any
contract year from and including march 31 2007 it may also be terminated
earlier by or upon mutual agreement bankruptcy or insolvency of a party
certain force majeure events a material breach and certain change of control
events as defined in the bbc analog transmission contract

   it is contemplated that the bbc analog transmission contract will be amended
and extended in some manner however there can be no assurances that any such
modifications or extensions will occur

   1998 bbc digital transmission contract in 1998 we bid for and won the
12year contract from the bbc to build and operate the dtt transmission network

contemplated by the contract under the contract the bbc may send us notice to
terminate the contract during november 2003 through january 2004 the
threemonth period following the fifth anniversary of our commencement of
digital terrestrial transmission services for the bbc but only if the bbcs
board of governors determines in its sole discretion that digital television
in the uk does not have sufficient viewership to justify continued digital
television broadcasts under this provision the bbc will pay us a termination
fee in cash that substantially recovers our capital investment in the network
as a result of this contract and any residual ongoing operating costs and
liabilities like the bbc analog transmission contract the contract is
terminable upon the occurrence of certain change of control events

entered into a 12year distribution contract with bt in which bt has agreed to
provide fully duplicated primarily fiberbased digital distribution services
this contract is now being used to provide program distribution services in
connection with freeview and has been amended to expire contemporaneously with
our dtt multiplex licenses in 2014 with provisions for extending the term

   sitesharing agreement in order to optimize service coverage for television
and radio services and to enable viewers to receive all analog uhf television
services using one receiving antenna the bbc as the predecessor to ccuk and
ntl made arrangements to share certain broadcast sites this arrangement was
introduced in the 1960s when uhf television broadcasting began in the uk in
addition to service coverage advantages the arrangement also minimizes costs
and avoids the difficulties of obtaining additional sites

   on september 10 1991 the bbc and ntl entered into the sitesharing
agreement which set out the commercial site sharing terms under which the
parties were entitled to share each others sites for any television and radio
services under the sitesharing agreement the party that is the owner lessee
or licensee of each site is defined as the station owner the other party
the sharer is entitled to request a license to use certain facilities at
that site the sitesharing agreement and each site license provide for the
station owner to be paid a commercial license fee in accordance with the
sitesharing agreement rate schedule and for the sharer to be responsible in
normal circumstances for the costs of accommodation and equipment used
exclusively by it the sitesharing agreement may be terminated with five
years prior notice on december 31 2005 or on any tenth anniversary of that
date as no notice was served in 2000 the next termination date is december
31 2015 it may also be terminated upon a material breach bankruptcy or
insolvency of a party and cessation of a broadcast transmission business or
function

   similar site sharing arrangements have been entered into between ntl and us
for the buildout of digital transmission sites and equipment including a
supplementary ratecard related to site sharing fees for new digital facilities
and revised operating and maintenance procedures related to digital equipment

   revenues received by ccuk under these ntl agreements with respect to space
rented by ntl on ccuk owned sites are substantially offset by payments made to
ntl with respect to space rented by ccuk on ntl owned sites

   tmobile northern ireland network in december 1999 ccuk and tmobile
entered into an agreement under which ccuk would establish a turnkey mobile
network for tmobile in northern ireland in april 2001 ccuk launched the
network which now covers approximately 985 of the population of northern
ireland ccuk provides cell planning acquisition design build operation and
maintenance services related to the network including ownership of the
antenna provisioning of backhaul and signal monitoring tmobile provides the
base stations and holds the spectrum license the agreement with tmobile is
for an initial term of 11 years we currently own and operate approximately 200
tower sites in northern ireland and tmobile is a tenant on substantially all
of these sites as part of the network

   british telecom agreement in november 2000 ccuk entered into an agreement
with bt to lease space on as many as 4000 bt sites principally rooftop
facilities throughout the uk we are developing the bt site portfolio for the
deployment of wireless services including second generation 2g and 3g
services we contracted to invest an aggregate of pounds150 million
approximately 241 million for the first 1500 sites from the bt site
portfolio but the final payment due is the subject of discussions as described
below as of december 31 2002 we had developed 648 sites under this
agreement in june 2001 ccuk signed a management services agreement to manage
the preexisting bt site sharing customers on the sites subject to this
agreement in april 2002 ccuk reached agreement with bt to defer until march

reduction in the number of bt sites acquired there can be no assurances as to
the outcome of these discussions

   hutchison 3g agreement in february 2001 ccuk signed an agreement with
hutchison 3g whereby hutchison 3g would lease space on a minimum of 4000 ccuk
sites throughout the uk currently hutchison 3g is not leasing the number of
sites required within the time period contemplated by the agreement we are
currently in discussions with hutchison 3g regarding several potential
amendments to this agreement including one such amendment which may result in
the deferral or reduction of hutchison 3gs take or pay commitments we are
also discussing with hutchison 3g amending the agreement to include ccuks new
build processes there can be no assurances as to the outcome of these
discussions

   o2 agreement in february 2001 ccuk signed an initial agreement with its
existing customer o2 pursuant to which o2 would lease additional space on ccuk
sites throughout the uk with a minimum take up of 1500 additional through
2003 a minimum take up of 500 sites per year for each of 2001 2002 and 2003
o2 did not satisfy the minimum take up requirements in 2001 or 2002 the terms
of the agreement are in dispute and we are currently in discussions with o2
which may result in the deferral or reduction of o2s take or pay commitments
there can be no assurances as to the outcome of these discussions

   third generation technology

   during april 2000 the united kingdom auctioned five licenses relating to 3g
mobile communications vodafone o2 tmobile orange and hutchison 3g
currently hold the 3g licenses acquired through these auctions we contemplate
working with the 3g license holders in order to provide site sharing of network
towers equipment and other communications infrastructure as a solution to many
of the commercial and technical challenges and costs which the 3g license
holders will face

   during 2000 and 2001 ccuk provided turnkey project management installation
and commissioning of the 3g radio access network including site planning
design build and radio frequency planning with respect to the network rollout
of europes first 3g network on the isle of man the network comprised of
approximately 28 sites was built by nec and siemens for manx telecom a wholly
owned subsidiary of mmo2 plc and was launched in december 2001 see
businessthe companyuk operationsnetwork servicesnetwork design and
site selection

   there can be no assurances that 3g or other new wireless technologies will
be introduced or deployed as rapidly or in the manner previously or presently
projected by the wireless industry the deployment of 3g has already been
significantly delayed as to prior projections in addition demand and customer
adoption rates of 3g and other technologies may be lower or slower than
anticipated for numerous reasons as a result growth opportunities and demand
for site rental as a result of such technologies may not be realized at the
times or to the extent previously or presently anticipated

   competition

   ccuks primary competitors with respect to its digital terrestrial broadcast
transmission platform are satellite and cable broadcast operators including
bskyb ntl telewest and cable  wireless ntl is ccuks primary competitor in
the terrestrial broadcast transmission market in the uk ntl provides analog
transmission services to itv channels 4 and 5 and s4c television networks
the national commercial radio service classic fm a number of local analog
commercial radio stations and digital one the national digital radio license
holder ntl retains partial ownership of both the sdn digital television
multiplex and digital one the national independent digital radio licensee ntl
has also been awarded the transmission contract for two of the six dtt
multiplexes ccuk operates the transmission network contracts for the other
four multiplexes two for the bbc and two for the ccuk licensed multiplexes

   although ccuk and ntl are broadcast competitors they have reciprocal rights
to the use of each others sites for broadcast transmission usage in order to
enable each of them to achieve the necessary countrywide coverage this
relationship is formalized by the sitesharing agreement entered into in 1991
the time at which ntl was privatized see businessthe companyuk
operationssignificant contractssitesharing agreement

   ccuks primary competition to its site leasing business comes from building
owners including utilities that lease space on colocatable rooftop sites
ntl also offers site rental on approximately 2000 of its sites some of which
are managed on behalf of third parties uk mobile operators own site
infrastructure and lease space to other users their openness to sharing with
direct competitors varies by operator however several operators have made
public statements indicating they are willing to share or jointly develop
certain sites with competitors and other third parties under certain
circumstances

   ccuk faces competition from a large number of companies in the provision of
network services the companies include specialty consultants and equipment
manufacturers such as nortel and ericsson ntl also offers certain network
services to its customers including installation and maintenance

  australia operations

   our primary business in australia is the leasing of antenna space to
wireless carriers ccal a joint venture which is owned 776 by us and 224

   ccal is the largest independent tower operator in australia with a
nationwide tower portfolio providing sites for cellular coverage for over 92
of the population in australia ccal currently operates 1387 towers with a
strategic presence in all of australias licensed regions including sydney
melbourne brisbane adelaide and perth

   716 of ccals towers were purchased from optus during 2000 for approximately
135 million australia 220 million in cash as part of this transaction
optus agreed to lease space on these towers for an initial term of 15 years
the agreement also provided ccal with an exclusive right to develop all future
tower sites for optus through april 2006 these buildtosuit provisions were
terminated in march 2002 by mutual consent in terminating the buildtosuit
arrangement it was agreed that ccal would purchase an additional 44 sites for
an aggregate of 57 million australia 105 million 41 of which have been
acquired to date

   an additional 643 towers were acquired from vodafone australia in april 2001
for approximately 121 million australia 240 million as part of this
transaction vodafone australia has agreed to lease space on these towers for
an initial period of 10 years and ccal has the exclusive right to acquire up
to 600 additional tower sites that vodafone may construct through april 2007
the vodafone australia acquisition was funded 851 by us and 149 by the jump
capital group which resulted in our interest in ccal being increased from
667 to 776 in 2002 ccal exercised its right under the warranty provisions
of the original acquisition agreement to return 18 towers which did not meet
certain criteria this resulted in a return to ccal of 35 million australia
63 million of consideration which was originally paid for these sites in
2002 ccal acquired an additional four sites from vodafone pursuant to the
terms of the original acquisition agreement

   as of december 31 2002 ccal also provided maintenance services on
approximately 1067 customer sites and management services on approximately
1094 customer sites

   in australia ccal competes with other independent tower owners which also
provide site rental and network services wireless carriers which own and
operate their own tower networks service companies that provide engineering
and site acquisition services and other site owners such as broadcasters and
building owners the two other significant tower owners in australia are
telstra and broadcast australia we believe that tower location capacity
quality of service deployment speed and price within a geographic market are
the most significant competitive factors affecting tower rental companies

employees

   at december 31 2002 we employed approximately 1462 people worldwide
other than in the uk we are not a party to any collective bargaining
agreements in the uk we are party to a collective bargaining agreement with
the broadcast entertainment cinematographic and theatrical union bectu
this agreement establishes bargaining procedures relating to the terms and
conditions of employment for all of ccuks nonmanagement staff ccuk is
currently in discussions with bectu regarding the potential restructure of
pension arrangements as they relate to the former employees of the bbc we

  united states

   federal regulations

   both the fcc and faa regulate towers used for wireless communications
transmitters and receivers such regulations control the siting and marking of
towers and may depending on the characteristics of particular towers require
the registration of tower facilities and the issuance of determinations
confirming no hazard to air traffic wireless communications devices operating
on towers are separately regulated and independently licensed based upon the
particular frequency used in addition the fcc and the faa have developed
standards to consider proposals for new or modified tower and antenna
structures based upon the height and location including proximity to airports
of proposed tower and antenna structures proposals to construct or to modify
existing tower and antenna structures above certain heights are reviewed by the
faa to ensure the structure will not present a hazard to aviation which
determination may be conditioned upon compliance with lighting and marking
requirements the fcc requires its licensees to operate communications devices
only on towers that comply with faa rules and are registered with the fcc if
required by its regulations where tower lighting is required by faa
regulation tower owners bear the responsibility of notifying the faa of any
tower lighting outage failure to comply with the applicable requirements may
lead to civil penalties

   local regulations

   local regulations include city and other local ordinances including
subdivision and zoning ordinances approvals for construction and removal of
towers and restrictive covenants imposed by community developers these
regulations vary greatly but typically require us to obtain approval from
local officials prior to tower construction local zoning authorities may
render decisions or place conditions on construction that are responsive to
community residents concerns regarding the height and visibility of the towers

   other regulations

   we hold through certain of our subsidiaries certain licenses for radio
transmission facilities granted by the fcc including licenses for common

run telecommunications systems and authorizes ccuk to run all the necessary
telecommunications systems to convey messages to its transmitter sites eg
via leased circuits or using its own microwave links the license does not
cover the provision of public switched telephony networks which would require
a public telecommunications license as described above

   satellite license the satellite license is a license to run
telecommunications systems for the provision of satellite telecommunication
services and allows the conveyance via satellite of messages including data
and radio broadcasting the license excludes television broadcasting direct to
the home via satellite although distribution via satellite of television

tower infrastructure accordingly ccal as a tower owner and operator does not
require a carrier license similarly because ccal does not own any
transmitters or spectrum it does not currently require any apparatus or
spectrum licenses issued under the federal radiocommunications act 1992

   carriers have a statutory obligation to provide other carriers with access
to tower facilities and sites and if there is a dispute including as to
pricing the matter may be referred to the australian competition and consumer
commission for resolution as a noncarrier ccal is not currently subject to
this regime and negotiates site access on a commercial basis

   while the federal telecommunications act 1997 grants certain exemptions from
planning laws for the installation of low impact facilities towers are
expressly excluded from the definition of low impact facilities accordingly
in connection with the construction of new tower facilities ccal is subject to
state and local planning laws which vary on a site by site basis for a limited

   in addition our earnings for the twelve months ended december 31 2002 were
insufficient to cover fixed charges by 2627 million

   as a result of our substantial indebtedness

     we could be more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry
      conditions

     we may find it more difficult to obtain additional financing to fund
      future working capital capital expenditures and other general corporate
      requirements

     we will be required to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow
      from operations to the payment of principal and interest on our debt
      reducing the available cash flow to fund other projects

     we may have limited flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes

our business depends on the demand for wireless communications and towerswe
have been and are likely to continue to be adversely affected by the slowdown
in the growth of or reduction in demand for wireless communications

   demand for our site rentals depends on demand for communication sites from
wireless carriers which in turn depends on the demand for wireless services
the demand for our sites depends on many factors which we cannot control
including

     the level of demand for specific sites

     the level of demand for wireless services generally

                                      22

     the financial condition and access to capital of wireless carriers

     the strategy of carriers relating to owning or leasing communication
      sites

     the availability of equipment to wireless carriers

     changes in telecommunications regulations and

     general economic conditions

   wireless carriers are currently competing vigorously with each other through
price reductions of their services to customers a prolonged price war among
our carrier customers could adversely affect their business and result in a
significant reduction in the number of new site leases from such carriers or
other material adverse effect on our business or operations

   a slowdown in the growth of or reduction in demand in a particular
wireless segment could adversely affect the demand for communication sites
moreover wireless carriers often operate with substantial indebtedness and
financial problems for our customers could result in accounts receivable going
uncollected the loss of a customer and associated lease revenue or a reduced
ability of these customers to finance expansion activities a slowdown in the
deployment of equipment for new wireless technology the consolidation of
wireless carriers the sharing of networks by wireless carriers or the
increased use of alternative sites eg rooftops could also adversely affect
the demand for our sites finally advances in technology such as the
development of new antenna systems new terrestrial deployment technologies and
new satellite systems could reduce the need for landbased or terrestrial
transmission networks to some extent almost all of the above factors have
occurred in recent years with an adverse effect on our business and such
factors are likely to persist in the future the occurrence of any of these
factors could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and
results of operations

continuation of the current economic and telecommunications industry
slowdownthis slowdown could materially and adversely affect our business
including reducing demand for our towers and network services and the
business of our customers

   the significant general slowdown in the us and certain international
economies particularly in the wireless and telecommunications industries has
negatively affected the factors described in the immediately preceding risk
factor influencing demand for tower space and network services this slowdown
could reduce consumer demand for wireless services or negatively impact the
debt and equity markets thereby causing carriers to delay or abandon
implementation of new systems and technologies including 3g and other wireless
broadband services further the war with iraq the war on terrorism the
threat of additional terrorist attacks and the political and economic
uncertainties resulting therefrom may impose additional risks upon and
adversely effect the telecommunications industry our business and our results
of operations

   we believe that the current economic slowdown particularly in the wireless
and telecommunications industries has already harmed and may continue to
harm the financial condition of some wireless service providers certain of
which including customers of ours have filed or may file for bankruptcy

failure to properly manage our operations and growthif we are unable to
successfully integrate acquired operations or manage our existing operations as
we grow our business will be adversely affected and we may not be able to
continue our current business strategy

   we cannot guarantee that we will be able to successfully integrate acquired
businesses and assets into our business or implement our growth plans without
delay if we fail to do so it could have a material adverse effect on our
financial condition and results of operations we have grown significantly over
the past four years and have undergone several restructurings further we will
be integrating additional sites relating to the bt agreement into our
portfolios see businessthe companyuk operationssignificant contracts

british telecom agreement successful integration of these transactions and
assets will depend primarily on our ability to manage these combined
operations for the twelve months ended december 31 2002 we had a net loss of
2725 million depreciation and amortization of 3019 million and interest
expense of 3026 million we expect that such significant net losses and
expenses will continue at least in the near term as a result of our prior
growth and the financing thereof

   implementation of any future consolidations acquisitions or exchanges may
impose significant strains on our management operating systems and financial
resources if we fail to manage our growth or encounter unexpected difficulties
during expansion or transition it could have a material adverse effect on our
financial condition and results of operations the pursuit and integration of
certain acquisitions exchanges and joint venture opportunities may require
substantial attention from our senior management which will limit the amount
of time they would otherwise be able to devote to our existing operations

a substantial portion of our revenues is derived from a small number of
customers including verizon the bbc and cingularthe loss or consolidation
of any of our limited number of customers could materially decrease revenues

   approximately 647 of our revenues are derived from 10 customers including
verizon and cingular which represented 163 and 96 of our revenues
respectively for the twelvemonth period ended december 31 2002 the loss of
any one of our large customers as a result of consolidation merger or
bankruptcy with other customers of ours or otherwise could materially decrease
our revenues and have other adverse effects on our business

   in addition a substantial portion of our revenues are received from a few
major wireless carriers particularly carriers that have transferred their
tower assets to us we cannot guarantee that the lease or management service
agreements with such carriers will not be terminated or that these carriers
will renew such agreements

   if we were to lose our contracts with the bbc or our site sharing agreement
with ntl we would likely lose a substantial portion of our revenues the bbc
accounted for approximately 112 of our revenues for the twelvemonth period
ended december 31 2002 further ntl has recently experienced some financial
difficulties and there can be no assurances that we will not experience
adverse effects relating to the financial difficulties of ntl

   our broadcast business is substantially dependent on our contracts with the
bbc we cannot guarantee that the bbc will renew our contracts or that they
will not attempt to negotiate terms that are not as favorable to us as those in
place now if we were to lose these bbc contracts our business results of
operations and financial condition would be materially adversely affected the
initial term of our analog transmission contract with the bbc will expire on
march 31 2007 and the initial terms of our two digital television
transmission contracts with the bbc expire on october 31 2008 and october 30
2010 respectively in addition the bbc can serve notice to terminate our
original digital transmission contract with them which currently provides
annual revenues of approximately pounds114 million 184 million per year
during november 2003 through january 2004 if the bbcs board of governors does
not believe that digital television in the uk has enough viewers

   a substantial portion of our uk broadcast transmission operations is
conducted using sites owned by ntl our principal broadcast competitor in the
uk ntl also utilizes our sites for their broadcast operations this site
sharing arrangement with ntl may be terminated on december 31 2015 or any
10year anniversary of that date with five years prior notice by either us or
ntl and may be terminated sooner if there is a continuing breach of the
agreement we cannot guarantee that this agreement will not be terminated
which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of
operations and financial condition

as a holding company we require dividends from subsidiaries to meet cash
requirements or pay dividendsif our subsidiaries are unable to dividend cash
to us when we need it we may be unable to pay dividends or satisfy our
obligations including interest and principal payments under our debt
instruments

   crown castle international corp or ccic is a holding company with no
business operations of its own ccics most significant asset is the
outstanding capital stock of its subsidiaries ccic conducts all of its
business operations through its subsidiaries accordingly ccics only source
of cash to pay dividends or make other distributions on its capital stock or to
pay interest and principal on its outstanding indebtedness is distributions
relating to its ownership interest in its subsidiaries from the net earnings
and cash flow generated by such subsidiaries or from proceeds of debt or equity
offerings we currently expect that the earnings and cash flow of ccics
subsidiaries will be retained and used by such subsidiaries in their
operations including the service of their respective debt obligations even if
we did determine to make a distribution in respect of the capital stock of
ccics subsidiaries there can be no assurance that ccics subsidiaries will
generate sufficient cash flow to pay or distribute such a dividend or funds or
that applicable state law and contractual restrictions including negative
covenants contained in the debt instruments of such subsidiaries would permit
such dividends distributions or payments furthermore the terms of our credit
facilities place restrictions on our principal subsidiaries ability to pay
dividends or to make distributions and in any event such dividends or
distributions may only be paid if no default has occurred under the applicable
instrument moreover ccics subsidiaries are permitted under the terms of
their existing debt instruments to incur additional indebtedness that may
restrict or prohibit the making of distributions the payment of dividends or
the making of loans by such subsidiaries to ccic see businessrisk
factorssubstantial level of indebtedness and businessrisk
factorsability to service debt

restrictive debt covenantsthe terms of our debt instruments limit our ability
to take a number of actions that our management might otherwise believe to be
in our best interests in addition if we fail to comply with our covenants
our debt could be accelerated

   currently we have debt instruments in place that restrict our ability to
incur more indebtedness pay dividends create liens sell assets and engage in
certain mergers and acquisitions our subsidiaries under their debt
instruments are also required to maintain specific financial ratios our
ability to comply with the restrictions of these instruments and to satisfy our
debt obligations will depend on our future operating performance if we fail to
comply with the debt restrictions we will be in default under those
instruments which in some cases would cause the maturity of substantially all
of our longterm indebtedness to be accelerated the restrictions may also
effect our decisions relating to certain strategic growth opportunities

we operate our business in a competitive industry and some of our competitors
have significantly more resourcesas a result of this competition we may find
it more difficult to achieve favorable lease rates on our towers

   we face competition for site rental customers from various sources
including

     other large independent tower owners

     wireless carriers that own and operate their own towers and lease antenna
      space to other carriers

     alternative facilities such as rooftops broadcast towers and utility
      poles

     new alternative deployment methods

     site development companies that acquire antenna space on existing towers
      for wireless carriers and manage new tower construction and

     traditional local independent tower operators

   wireless carriers that own and operate their own tower portfolios generally
are substantially larger and have greater financial resources than we have
further the weak financial status of certain of our competitors could

lead to increased competition in certain areas competition for tenants on
towers could adversely affect lease rates and service income

new technologies could make our tower antenna leasing services less desirable
to potential tenants and result in decreasing revenuessuch new technologies
could decrease demand for tower leases and negatively impact our revenues

   the development and deployment of signal combining technologies which
permit one antenna to service multiple transmission frequencies and thereby
multiple customers may reduce the need for towerbased broadcast transmission
and hence demand for our antenna space

   mobile satellite systems and other new technologies could compete with
landbased wireless communications systems thereby reducing the demand for
tower lease space and other services we provide the fcc has granted license
applications for several lowearth orbiting satellite systems that are intended
to provide mobile voice or data services the growth in delivery of video
services by direct broadcast satellites could also adversely affect demand for
our antenna space

   other technologies which may be developed and emerge could serve as
substitutes and alternatives to leasing which might otherwise be anticipated or
expected on our sites and towers had such technologies not existed any
reduction in tower leasing demand resulting from multiple band satellite or
other technologies could negatively impact our revenues or otherwise have a
material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of
operations

agreements among our customers may act as alternatives to leasing sites from
usthe proliferation of such agreements could have a material adverse effect
on our revenues and operations

   wireless service providers frequently enter into agreements with competitors
allowing them to utilize one anothers wireless communications facilities to
accommodate customers who are out of range of their home providers services
in addition wireless service providers have also entered into agreements
allowing two or more carriers to share a single wireless network or jointly
develop a tower portfolio in certain locations such agreements may be viewed
by wireless service providers as a superior alternative to leasing space for
their own antennas on our communication sites the proliferation of these
roaming network sharing and joint development agreements could have a material
adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations

variability in demand for network services business has reduced the
predictability of our resultsour network services business has historically
experienced significant volatility in demand

   the operating results of our network services business for any particular
period may vary significantly and should not necessarily be considered
indicative of longerterm results network services revenues have also been
adversely impacted in the us due to reduced antenna installation activity
related to a decrease in new tenants further we continue to reduce our
network service offerings and therefore the service business has and should
continue to become less significant to our operations

we may need additional financing for strategic growth opportunities which may
not be availableif we are unable to raise capital in the future when needed
we may not be able to fund future growth opportunities

   over time we may require significant capital expenditures for strategic
growth opportunities  currently we have agreed to lease space on and develop

   as of december 31 2002 we had consolidated cash and cash equivalents of
5162 million and consolidated liquid investments consisting of marketable
securities of 1157 million we also had approximately 11 billion in
outstanding borrowings under our credit facilities at that date our ability to
borrow under the credit facilities is limited by the financial covenants
contained in those agreements including covenants relating to current
financial performance as defined in the various credit agreements levels of
indebtedness and debt service requirements under the terms of the credit
facilities we could draw approximately 500 million in additional borrowings
as of december 31 2002 while remaining in compliance with these covenants

   we may need additional sources of debt or equity capital in the future to
fund future growth opportunities additional financing may not be available or
may be restricted by the terms of our credit facilities and the terms of our
other outstanding indebtedness additional sales of equity securities will
dilute our existing stockholders if we are unable to raise capital when our
needs arise we may not be able to fund future growth opportunities

we generally lease or sublease the land under our towers and may not be able to
maintain these leasesif we fail to protect our rights against persons
claiming superior rights in our communications sites our business may be
adversely affected

   our real property interests relating to our communications sites consist
primarily of fee interests leasehold and subleasehold interests easements
licenses and rightsofway a loss of these interests including losses arising
from the bankruptcy of one or more of our significant lessors or from the
default by one or more of our lessors under their mortgage financing could
interfere with our ability to conduct our business and generate revenues for
various reasons we may not always have the ability to access analyze and
verify all information regarding titles and other issues prior to completing an
acquisition of sites further we may not be able to renew ground leases on
commercially viable terms approximately 13 of our sites are on land where our
property interests in such land have a final expiration date of less than ten
years our inability to protect our rights to the land under our towers could
have a material adverse affect on our business financial condition and results
of operations

laws and regulations which could change at any time and with which we could
fail to comply regulate our businessif we fail to comply with applicable laws
or regulations we could be fined or even lose our right to conduct some of our

our business failure to comply with applicable requirements may lead to civil
penalties or require us to assume indemnification obligations or breach
contractual provisions we cannot guarantee that existing or future laws or
regulations will not adversely affect our business increase delays or result
in additional costs these factors could have a material adverse effect on our

emissions from antennas on our towers may create health riskswe could suffer
from future claims if the radio frequency emissions from equipment on our
towers is demonstrated to cause negative health effects

   the fcc and other government agencies impose requirements and other
guidelines on its licensees relating to radio frequency emissions the
potential connection between radio frequency emissions and certain negative
health effects including some forms of cancer has been the subject of
substantial study by the scientific community in recent years to date the
results of these studies have been inconclusive we cannot guarantee that
claims relating to radio frequency emissions will not arise in the future or
that the results of such studies will not be adverse to our business

   public perception of possible health risks associated with cellular and
other wireless communications could slow or diminish the growth of wireless
companies which could in turn slow or diminish our growth in

                                      27

page

particular negative public perception of and regulations regarding these
perceived health risks could slow or diminish the market acceptance of wireless
communications services

   our exposure to the potential risk of harm due to radio frequency emissions
may increase as the number of rooftop sites in our portfolios including the
sites we acquire on rooftop sites pursuant to our agreement with bt increases
see businessthe companyuk operationssignificant contractsbritish
telecom agreement rooftop sites may tend to be more accessible to a wider
range of personnel including personnel with little or no knowledge of wireless
communications equipment than tower sites increasing the number of persons
who may be potentially exposed to emissions emanating from equipment located on
such rooftops

   if a connection between radio emissions and possible negative health effects
were established our operations costs and revenues would be materially and
adversely affected we do not maintain any significant insurance with respect
to these matters

our international operations expose us to changes in foreign currency exchange
ratesif we fail to properly match or hedge the currencies in which we conduct
business we could suffer losses as a result of changes in currency exchange
rates

   we conduct business in countries outside the us which exposes us to
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates for the 12 months ended
december 31 2002 approximately 363 of our consolidated revenues originated
outside the us all of which were denominated in currencies other than us
dollars principally british pounds sterling and australian dollars we have
not historically engaged in significant hedging activities relating to our
nonus dollar operations and we could suffer future losses as a result of
changes in currency exchange rates

we are heavily dependent on our senior managementif we lose members of our
senior management we may not be able to find appropriate replacements on a
timely basis and our business could be adversely affected

   our existing operations and continued future development depend to a
significant extent upon the performance and active participation of certain key
individuals as employees including our chief executive officer we cannot
guarantee that we will be successful in retaining the services of these or
other key personnel if we were to lose any of these individuals we may not be
able to find or integrate appropriate replacements on a timely basis and our
financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely
affected

antitakeover provisions in our certificate of incorporation and competition
laws could have effects that conflict with the interests of our
stockholderscertain provisions of our certificate of incorporation bylaws
and operative agreements and domestic and international competition laws could
make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us or for us to
acquire control of a third party even if such a change in control would be
beneficial to you

   we have a number of antitakeover devices in place that will hinder takeover
attempts and could reduce the market value of our common stock our
antitakeover provisions include

     a staggered board of directors

     a shareholder rights agreement

     the authority of the board of directors to issue preferred stock without
      approval of the holders of common stock and

     advance notice requirements for director nominations and actions to be
      taken at annual meetings

upon the request of a majority of the board of directors and deny stockholders
the ability to call such meetings further our bbc contracts may be terminated
upon the occurrence of certain change of control events described in such
contracts such provisions as well as the provisions of section 203 of the
delaware general corporation law could impede a merger consolidation
takeover or other business combination or discourage a potential acquiror from
making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us

   in addition domestic and international competition laws could prevent us
from acquiring towers or tower networks in certain geographical areas or impede
a merger consolidation takeover or other business combination or discourage a

compensation plans 1639990 shares of common stock upon exercise of
outstanding warrants and 16066944 shares of common stock for the conversion

   a small number of shareholders owns a significant percentage of our
outstanding common stock if any one of these shareholders or any group of our
shareholders sells a large quantity of shares of our common stock or the
public market perceives that existing shareholders might sell shares of common
stock the market price of our common stock could significantly decline

right to dissolve those ventures upon a dissolution of either venture the
shares of our common stock then held by the venture currently 5063731 shares

either such venture could adversely affect the market price of our common stock

   the holders of our 8 14 convertible preferred stock and our 625
convertible preferred stock are entitled to receive cumulative dividends at the
rate of 8 14 per annum and 625 per annum respectively payable on a
quarterly basis we have the option to pay the dividends on such series of
preferred stock in cash or in shares of our common stock we have historically
paid such dividends with shares of our common stock and we expect to continue
to do so the number of shares of our common stock required to be issued to pay
such dividends is dependent upon the current market value of our common stock
at the time such dividend is required to be paid for the years ended december
31 2001 and 2002 dividends on our 8 14 convertible preferred stock were
paid with 1400000 and 4290000 shares of common stock respectively and
dividends on our 625 convertible preferred stock were paid with 1781764 and
6338153 shares of common stock respectively the shares of common stock
issued to pay such dividends will continue to have a dilutive effect upon the
shares of our common stock otherwise outstanding and further declines in the
fair market value of our common stock will increase the effective dilution in
2002 as allowed by the deposit agreement relating to dividend payments on the
8 14 convertible preferred stock we repurchased 3745000 shares of common
stock from the dividend paying agent for a total of 122 million in cash we
may continue to repurchase the shares of common stock issued as dividends on
our preferred stock in order to mitigate the dilution caused by the issuance of
such common stock however there can be no assurances that we will do so

by statutory access rights



item 3 legal proceedings

   we are periodically involved in legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary
course of business most of these proceedings involve disputes with landlords
collection matters involving bankrupt customers appeals of zoning and variance

dividend policy

   we have never declared nor paid any cash dividends on our capital stock and
do not anticipate paying cash dividends on our capital stock in the foreseeable
future it is our current policy to retain earnings to finance the expansion of
our operations future declaration and payment of cash dividends if any will
be determined in light of the thencurrent conditions including our earnings
operations capital requirements financial condition and other factors deemed
relevant by the board of directors in addition our ability to pay dividends
is limited by the terms of our debt instruments and the terms of the
certificates of designations in respect of our exchangeable preferred stock and
our convertible preferred stock

   the holders of our 8 14 convertible preferred stock and our 625
convertible preferred stock are entitled to receive cumulative dividends at the
rate of 8 14 per annum and 625 per annum respectively payable on a
quarterly basis we have the option to pay the dividends on such series of
preferred stock in cash or in shares of our common stock we have historically
paid such dividends with shares of our common stock and we expect to continue
to do so the number of shares of our common stock required to be issued to pay
such dividends is dependent upon the current market value of our common stock
at the time such dividend is required to be paid for the years ended december
31 2000 2001 and 2002 dividends on our 8 14 convertible preferred stock
were paid with 579000 1400000 and 4290000 shares of common stock
respectively and dividends on our 625 convertible preferred stock were paid
with 281968 1781764 and 6338153 shares of common stock respectively the
shares of common stock issued to pay such dividends will continue to have a
dilutive effect upon the shares of our common stock otherwise outstanding and
further declines in the fair market value of our common stock will increase the
effective dilution in 2002 as allowed by the deposit agreement relating to
dividend payments on the 8 14 convertible preferred stock we repurchased
3745000 shares of common stock from the dividend paying agent for a total of
122 million in cash we utilized cash from an unrestricted investment

item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results
of operations

   the following discussion is intended to assist in understanding our
consolidated financial condition as of december 31 2002 and our consolidated
results of operations for each year in the threeyear period ended december 31
2002 the statements in this discussion regarding the industry outlook our
expectations regarding the future performance of our businesses and the other
nonhistorical statements in this discussion are forwardlooking statements see
cautionary statement for purposes of forwardlooking statements this
discussion should be read in conjunction with selected financial data and the
consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this
document results of operations of the acquired businesses and towers that are
wholly and majority owned are included in our consolidated financial statements
for the periods subsequent to the respective dates of acquisition as such our
results of operations for the year ended december 31 2001 are not comparable
to the year ended december 31 2000

overview

   the growth of our business depends substantially on the condition of the
wireless communications and broadcast industries we believe that the demand
for new communications sites will continue although possibly not at the levels
experienced in prior years the level of demand for new sites declined in 2002
as compared to 2001 as evidenced by a decrease of approximately 40 in the
number of new tenants we were able to add to our sites we also expect that
due to increased competition wireless carriers will continue to seek operating
and capital efficiencies by 1 outsourcing certain network services and the
buildout and operation of new and existing infrastructure and 2 planning to
use a tower site as a common location for the placement of their antennas and
transmission equipment alongside the equipment of other communications
providers

   further we believe that wireless carriers and broadcasters will continue to
seek to outsource the operation of their towers and may eventually outsource
all or part of their transmission networks including the transmission of their
signals management believes that our ability to 1 manage towers and
transmission networks and 2 provide services addressing most aspects of
signaling systems from the originating station to the terminating receiver to
the wireless communications and broadcasting industries position us to capture
such business

   the willingness of wireless carriers to utilize our infrastructure and
related services is affected by numerous factors including

     consumer demand for wireless services

     availability and location of our sites and alternative sites

     cost of capital including interest rates

     availability of capital to wireless carriers

                                      35

page

     willingness to colocate equipment

     local restrictions on the proliferation of towers

     cost of building towers

     technological changes affecting the number of communications sites needed
      to provide wireless communications services to a given geographic area

     our ability to efficiently satisfy their service requirements and

     tax policies

   our revenues that are derived from the provision of transmission services to
the broadcasting industry will be affected by among other things

     consumer demand for digital television broadcasts from towermounted
      antenna systems or digital terrestrial television broadcasts
      principally in the united kingdom

     cost of capital including interest rates

     zoning restrictions on towers and

     the cost of building towers

   as an important part of our business strategy we will seek to

   1 maximize utilization of our tower capacity to grow revenues organically

   2 grow our margins by taking advantage of the relatively fixed nature of
       the operating costs associated with our site rental business

   3 allocate capital efficiently as we selectively build new towers for
       wireless carriers acquire other assets or repurchase our own
       securities and

   4 utilize the expertise of us uk including our broadcast
       transmission expertise and australian personnel to extend revenues
       around our existing assets

critical accounting policies

   the following is a discussion of the accounting policies that we believe 1
are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of
operations and 2 require our most difficult subjective or complex judgments
often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters
that are inherently uncertain

   revenue recognition

   site rental and broadcast transmission revenues are recognized on a monthly
basis over the term of the relevant lease agreement or contract in accordance
with applicable accounting standards these revenues are recognized on a
straightline basis regardless of whether the payments from the customer are
received in equal monthly amounts some agreements provide for rentfree
periods at the beginning of the lease term while others call for rent to be
prepaid for some period if the payment terms call for fixed escalations as in
fixed dollar or fixed percentage increases the effect of such increases is
spread evenly over the term of the agreement as a result of this accounting
method a portion of the revenue recognized in a given period represents cash
collected in other periods for 2001 and 2002 the noncash portion of our site
rental and broadcast transmission revenues amounted to approximately 236
million and 264 million respectively

   network services revenues are generally recognized under the completed
contract method under the completed contract method revenues and costs for a
particular project are recognized in total at the completion

                                      36

page

date when using the completed contract method of accounting for network
services revenues we must accurately determine the completion date for the
project in order to record the revenues and costs in the proper period for
antenna installations we consider the project complete when the customer can
begin transmitting its signal through the antenna we must also be able to
estimate losses on uncompleted contracts as such losses must be recognized as
soon as they are known the completed contract method is used for projects that
require relatively short periods of time to complete generally less than one
year we do not believe that our use of the completed contract method for
network services projects produces operating results that differ substantially
from the percentageofcompletion method

   allowance for doubtful accounts receivable

   as part of our normal accounting procedures we must evaluate our
outstanding accounts receivable to estimate whether they will be collected
this is a subjective process that involves making judgments about our
customers ability and willingness to pay these accounts an allowance for
doubtful accounts is recorded as an offset to accounts receivable in order to
present a net balance that we believe will be collected in estimating the
appropriate balance for this allowance we consider 1 specific reserves for
accounts we believe may prove to be uncollectible and 2 additional reserves
based on historical collections for the remainder of our accounts additions
to the allowance for doubtful accounts are charged to operating expenses and
deductions from the allowance are recorded when specific accounts receivable
are written off as uncollectible if our estimate of uncollectible accounts
should prove to be inaccurate at some future date the results of operations
for the period could be materially affected by any necessary correction to the
allowance for doubtful accounts

   valuation of longlived assets

   we review the carrying values of property and equipment and other longlived
assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that
the carrying amounts may not be recoverable if the sum of the estimated future
cash flows undiscounted from the asset is less than its carrying amount an
impairment loss is recognized measurement of an impairment loss is based on
the fair value of the asset our determination that an adverse event or change
in circumstance has occurred will generally involve 1 a deterioration in an
assets financial performance compared to historical results 2 a shortfall
in an assets financial performance compared to forecasted results or 3 a
change in strategy affecting the utility of the asset our measurement of the
fair value of an impaired asset will generally be based on an estimate of
discounted future cash flows

   on january 1 2002 we adopted the new accounting standard for goodwill and
other intangible assets in accordance with that new standard we test goodwill
for impairment on an annual basis regardless of whether adverse events or
changes in circumstances have occurred this annual impairment test involves
1 a step to identify potential impairment at a reporting unit level based on
fair values and 2 a step to measure the amount of the impairment if any
our measurement of the fair value for goodwill is based on an estimate of
discounted future cash flows of the reporting unit

   during the fourth quarter of 2002 we performed our annual update of the
impairment test for goodwill the results of this test indicate that goodwill
is not impaired at any of our reporting units however the amount by which the
estimated fair value for ccusa exceeds its carrying value has declined since
january 1 2002 this decline is a function of our reduced forecasts for site
leasing and antenna installation revenues as indicated by our operating
results for 2002 further declines in our site leasing and network services
business at ccusa could result in an impairment of goodwill in the future
furthermore if an impairment at ccusa were to occur in the future we believe
that the calculations to measure the impairment could result in the writeoff
of substantially all of ccusas goodwill 1640 million due to the continued
weakness in the telecommunications industry we intend to closely monitor the
performance of our reporting units in 2003 in order to assess whether a
goodwill impairment is indicated

   deferred income taxes

   we record deferred income tax assets and liabilities on our balance sheet
related to events that impact our financial statements and tax returns in
different periods in order to compute these deferred tax balances we first
analyze the differences between the book basis and tax basis of our assets and
liabilities referred to as temporary differences these temporary
differences are then multiplied by current tax rates to arrive at the balances
for the deferred income tax assets and liabilities if deferred tax assets
exceed deferred tax liabilities we must estimate whether those net deferred
asset amounts will be realized in the future a valuation allowance is then
provided for the net deferred asset amounts that are not likely to be realized

   the change in our net deferred income tax balances during a period results
in a deferred income tax provision or benefit in our statement of operations
if our expectations about the future tax consequences of past events should
prove to be inaccurate the balances of our deferred income tax assets and
liabilities could require significant adjustments in future periods such
adjustments could cause a material effect on our results of operations for the
period of the adjustment

results of operations

   our primary sources of revenues are from

   1 renting antenna space on towers and rooftops sites

   2 providing analog and digital broadcast transmission services and

   3 providing network services including the installation of antennas on
       our sites as well as third party sites

   site rental revenues in the us are received primarily from wireless
communications companies including those operating in the following categories
of wireless communications

     cellular

     personal communications services pcs a digital service operating at
      a higher frequency range than cellular

     enhanced specialized mobile radio esmr a service operating in the
      smr frequency range using enhanced technology

     wireless data services

     microwave

     paging and

     specialized mobile radio smr a service operating in the frequency
      range used for twoway radio communication by public safety trucking
      companies and other dispatch service users

site rental revenues are generally recognized on a monthly basis under lease
agreements which typically have original terms of five to ten years with
three or four optional renewal periods of five years each

   broadcast transmission services revenues in the uk are received for both
analog and digital transmission services monthly analog transmission revenues
are principally received from the bbc under a contract with an initial 10year
term through march 31 2007 digital transmission services revenues from the
bbc are recognized under a contract with an initial term of 12 years through
november 15 2010 monthly revenues from this digital transmission contract
increase over time as the network rollout progresses in addition in
connection with the launch of freeview we receive digital transmission
services revenues from the bbc bskyb and other tv content providers under
contracts with initial terms of six years see item 1 businessthe

   site rental revenues in the uk are received from other broadcast
transmission service providers primarily ntl and wireless communications
companies including the uk cellular operators site rental revenues are
generally recognized on a monthly basis under lease agreements with original
terms of three to 12 years such lease agreements generally require annual
payments in advance and include rental rate adjustment provisions between one
and three years from the commencement of the lease ccuk is a party to two
agreements that contemplate a minimum level of site leasing and contain certain
take or pay commitments by the carriers in each case the carrier is not
leasing the number of sites within the time period contemplated by the
agreement ccuk is working with the carriers to resolve differences and it is
possible that some form of negotiated settlement will occur that would relieve
the carriers of their site leasing commitments see ccuk take or pay
agreements

   network services revenues in the us consist of revenues from

   1 antenna installation

   2 site acquisition

   3 site development and construction

   4 network design and site selection and

   5 other services

network services revenues are received primarily from wireless communications
companies network services revenues in the us are recognized under service
contracts which provide for billings on either a fixed price basis or a time
and materials basis demand for our network services fluctuates from period to
period and within periods see item 1 businessrisk factorsvariability in
demand for services business has reduced the predictability of our results
consequently the operating results of our network services businesses for any
particular period may vary significantly and should not be considered as
indicative of longerterm results in 2002 we made a strategic decision to
reduce our network services offerings to primarily the management of antenna
installations on our sites and radio frequency planning and testing we also
derive services revenues from the ownership and operation of microwave radio
and smr networks in puerto rico where we own radio wave spectrum in the 2000
mhz and 6000 mhz range for microwave radio and the 800 mhz range for
specialized mobile radio these revenues are generally recognized under
monthly management or service agreements

   network services revenues in the uk consist of 1 network design and site
selection site acquisition site development and antenna installation and 2
site management and other services network design and development and related
services are provided to

   1 a number of broadcasting and related organizations both in the united
       kingdom and other countries

   2 certain uk cellular operators and

   3 hutchison as part of their deployment of 3g services in the uk

these services are often subject to a competitive bid and a significant
proportion result from an operator coming onto an existing ccuk site revenues
from such services are recognized on either a fixed price or a time and
materials basis site management and other services consisting of both network
monitoring and equipment maintenance are carried out in the uk for a number
of emergency service organizations ccuk receives revenues for such services
under contracts with original terms of between three and five years such
contracts provide fixed prices for network monitoring and variable pricing
dependent on the level of equipment maintenance carried out in a given period

   costs of operations for site rental in the us primarily consist of

     land leases

     property taxes

                                      39

page

     repairs and maintenance

     employee compensation and related benefits costs

     utilities

     insurance and

     monitoring costs

for any given tower such costs are relatively fixed over a monthly or an
annual time period as such operating costs for owned towers do not generally
increase significantly as additional customers are added

   costs of operations for broadcast transmission services in the uk consist
primarily of employee compensation and related benefits costs utilities
rental payments under the sitesharing agreement with ntl circuit costs
repairs and maintenance on both transmission equipment and structures property
taxes and insurance site rental operating costs in the uk consist primarily
of employee compensation and related benefits costs utilities and repairs
maintenance and leases of land or rooftop sites property taxes and insurance
with the exception of land and rooftop leases the majority of such costs are
relatively fixed in nature with increases in revenue from new installations on
existing sites generally being achieved without a corresponding increase in
costs generally leases of land and rooftop sites have a revenue sharing
component that averages 20 to 35 of additional revenues added from subsequent
tenants

   costs of operations for network services consist primarily of employee
compensation and related benefits costs subcontractor services consulting
fees and other onsite construction and materials costs we incur these
network services costs 1 to support our internal operations including
maintenance of our owned towers and 2 to maintain the employees necessary to
provide services to third parties

   general and administrative expenses consist primarily of

     employee compensation training recruitment and related benefits costs

     professional and consulting fees

     office rent and related expenses

     state franchise taxes and

     travel costs

   corporate development expenses represent costs incurred in connection with
acquisitions and development of new business initiatives these expenses
consist primarily of

     allocated compensation and related benefits costs

     external professional fees and

     overhead costs that are not directly related to the administration or
      management of existing towers

   depreciation and amortization charges relate to our property and equipment
which consists primarily of towers broadcast transmission equipment
associated buildings construction equipment and vehicles and other intangible
assets recorded in connection with business acquisitions depreciation of
towers and broadcast transmission equipment is generally computed with a useful
life of 20 years amortization of other intangible assets principally the
value of existing site rental contracts at crown communication is computed
with a useful life of 10 years depreciation of buildings is generally computed
with useful lives ranging from 20 to 40 years depreciation of construction
equipment and vehicles is generally computed with useful lives of 10 years and
5 years respectively

   during 2000 and 2001 we completed the transactions with bellsouth and
bellsouth dcs in 2000 we completed the transaction with gte additionally
during 2000 crown atlantic acquired the frontier towers from bell atlantic
mobile and ccal completed the substantial portion of the transaction with
cable  wireless optus results of operations of these acquired businesses and
towers are included in our consolidated financial statements for the periods
subsequent to the respective dates of acquisition in addition we have various
transactions recorded in our financial statements as described below that are
nonrecurring in nature as such our results of operations for the year ended
december 31 2002 are not comparable to the year ended december 31 2001 and
the results for the year ended december 31 2001 are not comparable to the year
ended december 31 2000

   during 2002 us wireless carriers developed significantly fewer new
communications sites than were developed in 2001 as a result the pace at
which we were able to add new tenants to our sites decreased by approximately
40 during 2002 network services revenues have also been adversely impacted in
the us due to reduced antenna installation activity related to the decrease in
new tenants along with our strategic decision to reduce our us network
services offerings to primarily the management of antenna installations on our
sites and radio frequency planning and testing network services revenues
declined as a percentage of our total revenues during 2002 and we expect such
decline as a percentage of total revenues to continue in the foreseeable future

the increases in site rental and broadcast transmission revenues reflect the
new tenant additions on our tower sites the increases in network services and
other revenues reflect continued demand for antenna installation from our
tenants along with increased third party service work

   costs of operations for 2001 were 4672 million an increase of 1526
million from 2000 this increase was primarily attributable to

   1 a 443 million increase in site rental and broadcast transmission
       costs of which 87 million was attributable to ccuk 57 million was
       attributable to crown atlantic 36 million was attributable to ccal
       and 263 million was attributable to ccusa

   2 a 944 million increase in network services costs related to ccusa

   3 a 92 million increase in network services costs from ccuk

   4 a 38 million increase in network services costs from crown atlantic
       and

   5 10 million in network services costs from ccal

costs of operations for site rental and broadcast transmission as a percentage
of site rental and broadcast transmission revenues decreased to 415 for 2001
from 436 for 2000 because of higher margins attributable to incremental
revenues from the crown atlantic ccal and ccusa operations costs of
operations for network services and other as a percentage of network services
and other revenues increased to 707 for 2001 from 592 for 2000 because of
lower margins from the ccusa ccuk and crown atlantic operations network
services revenues for 2001 included a greater proportion of third party service
work than in 2000 and third party services typically produce lower margins
than tenant antenna installation services

   general and administrative expenses for 2001 were 1025 million an
increase of 256 million from 2000 this increase was primarily attributable
to

   1 an 114 million increase in expenses related to the ccusa operations

   2 a 94 million increase in expenses at our corporate office

   3 a 33 million increase in expenses at ccuk and

   4 a 18 million increase in expenses at ccal partially offset by

   5 a 03 million decrease in expenses at crown atlantic

the increases in general and administrative expenses resulted primarily from
higher staffing levels to support the growth of our business general and
administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues decreased for 2001 to 114
from 118 for 2000 because of lower overhead costs as a percentage of revenues
for ccusa ccal and crown atlantic

   corporate development expenses for 2001 were 123 million compared to
105 million for 2000 this increase was primarily attributable to an increase
in expenses at our corporate office

   for 2001 we recorded cash charges of 194 million in connection with a
restructuring of our business announced in july 2001 such charges related to
employee severance payments and costs of office closures see restructuring
charges and asset writedown charges

   for 2001 we recorded asset writedown charges of 249 million in
connection with the restructuring of our business announced in july 2001 such
noncash charges related to writedowns of certain inventories property and
equipment and other assets see restructuring charges and asset writedown
charges

   for 2001 we recorded noncash general and administrative compensation
charges of 61 million related to the issuance of stock and stock options to
certain employees and executives compared to 31 million for 2000 see
compensation charges related to stock option grants and acquisitions

   depreciation and amortization for 2001 was 3285 million an increase of
897 million from 2000 this increase was primarily attributable to

   1 a 163 million increase in depreciation and amortization related to the
       property and equipment and goodwill from ccuk

   2 a 109 million increase in depreciation and amortization related to the
       property and equipment and goodwill from crown atlantic

   3 a 59 million increase in depreciation and amortization related to
       property and equipment from ccal and

   4 a 563 million increase in depreciation and amortization related to the
       property and equipment goodwill and other intangible assets related to
       the ccusa operations

                                      49

   interest and other income expense for 2001 resulted primarily from

   1 the investment of the net proceeds from our securities offerings offset
       by

   2 costs incurred in connection with unsuccessful acquisition attempts and

   3 our share of losses incurred by unconsolidated affiliates

   interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs for 2001 was
2974 million an increase of 562 million or 233 from 2000 this
increase was primarily attributable to interest on indebtedness at ccusa ccuk
and crown atlantic and interest on the 1034 senior notes and the 9 38
senior notes see liquidity and capital resources

   the provision for income taxes of 165 million for 2001 consists primarily
of a noncash deferred tax liability recognized by ccuk ccuks deferred tax
liability resulted from an excess of basis differences for its property and
equipment over its available tax net operating losses

liquidity and capital resources

   our business strategy contemplates substantial capital expenditures
although significantly reduced from previous years levels in connection with
the selective expansion of our tower portfolios in the markets in which we
currently operate during 2003 we expect that the majority of our
discretionary capital expenditures other than the pounds500 million site
access fee payment due to british telecom will occur at ccuk in connection
with the development of the sites acquired from british telecom

   since its inception ccic has generally funded its activities other than
acquisitions and investments through excess proceeds from contributions of
equity capital and cash provided by operations ccic has financed acquisitions
and investments with the proceeds from equity contributions borrowings under
our senior credit facilities and issuances of debt securities since its
inception ccuk has generally funded its activities other than the acquisition
of the bbc home service transmission business through cash provided by
operations and borrowings under ccuks credit facility ccuk financed the
acquisition of the bbc home service transmission business with the proceeds
from equity contributions and the issuance of the ccuk bonds

   during 2002 we have taken actions to reduce delay or eliminate contractual
obligations for certain capital expenditures we have accomplished the
following

   1 the deferral of a pounds500 million payment due to british telecom
       from 2002 to 2003 and

   2 the completion and winding up by mutual agreement of buildtosuit
       contracts with two significant customers of ccusa and crown atlantic
       thereby eliminating future tower construction obligations

these actions and others we are pursuing will serve to increase our financial
flexibility and improve our ability to allocate our capital on a discretionary
basis to the highest yielding investments including the securities repurchases
as described below our goal is to maximize net cash from operating activities
and fund substantially all capital spending and debt service from our operating
cash flow beginning in 2003 without reliance on additional borrowing or the
use of our cash and liquid investments however due to the risk factors
outlined above there can be no assurance that this will be possible

   for the years ended december 31 2000 2001 and 2002 our net cash provided
by operating activities was 1655 million 1319 million and 2089 million
respectively for the years ended december 31 2000 2001

                                      50

page

and 2002 our net cash provided by used for financing activities was 17071
million 11093 million and 3351 million respectively for the year
ending december 31 2003 we expect that our net cash provided by operating
activities will be between approximately 140 million and 200 million

   capital expenditures were 2773 million for the year ended december 31
2002 of which 07 million were for ccic 824 million were for ccusa 235
million were for crown atlantic 1656 million were for ccuk and 51 million
were for ccal we anticipate that we will build through the end of 2003
approximately 10 to 20 towers in the united states at a cost of approximately
48 million and approximately 240 to 280 tower sites in the united kingdom at
a cost of approximately 160 million in addition we are obligated to pay a
site access fee to british telecom in the amount of pounds500 million 805
million with such payment due in march 2003 we are currently in discussions
regarding the mitigation of this payment but there can be no assurance as to
the outcome of these discussions we also expect to spend approximately 400
million for tower improvements including enhancements to the structural
capacity of our towers in order to support the anticipated leasing and
approximately 400 million for maintenance activities for the year ending
december 31 2003 we expect that our total capital expenditures will be
between approximately 95 million and 125 million as such we expect that our
capital expenditures for this period excluding the payment to british telecom
will be fully funded by net cash from operating activities as discussed above

   we expect that the construction of new tower sites will continue to have an
impact on our liquidity we expect that once integrated these new towers will
have a positive impact on liquidity but will require some period of time to
offset the initial adverse impact on liquidity in addition we believe that as
new towers become operational and we begin to add tenants they should result
in a longterm increase in liquidity our decisions regarding the construction
of new towers are discretionary and depend upon expectations of achieving
acceptable rates of return given current market conditions such decisions are
influenced by the availability of capital and expected returns on alternative
investments we have increased our minimum acceptable level for internal rates
of return on new tower builds given current market conditions and expect to
continue to decrease the number of new towers built in the foreseeable future

   to fund the execution of our business strategy including the construction
of new towers we expect to use our available cash balances and cash provided
by future operations we do not currently expect to utilize further borrowings
available under our us and uk credit facilities in any significant amounts
we will have additional cash needs to fund our operations in the future we may
also have additional cash needs in the future if additional tower acquisitions
buildtosuit or other opportunities arise if we do not otherwise have cash
available or borrowings under our credit facilities have otherwise been
utilized when our cash need arises we would be forced to seek additional debt
or equity financing or to forego the opportunity in the event we determine to
seek additional debt or equity financing there can be no assurance that any
such financing will be available on commercially acceptable terms or at all
or permitted by the terms of our existing indebtedness

   as of december 31 2002 we had consolidated cash and cash equivalents of
5162 million including 494 million at ccusa 1133 million at ccuk 106
million at crown atlantic 163 million at ccal 1672 million in an
unrestricted investment subsidiary and 1594 million at ccic and a restricted
investment subsidiary consolidated liquid investments consisting of
marketable securities of 1157 million consolidated longterm debt of
32270 million consolidated redeemable preferred stock of 7560 million and
consolidated stockholders equity of 22085 million

   in june september and december of 2002 we paid our quarterly dividends on
the 814 convertible preferred stock by issuing a total of 37 million shares
of our common stock as allowed by the deposit agreement relating to dividend
payments on the 814 convertible preferred stock we repurchased the 37
million shares of common stock from the dividend paying agent for a total of
122 million in cash we utilized cash from an unrestricted investment
subsidiary to effect the stock repurchases we may choose to continue such
issuances and repurchases of stock in the future in order to avoid further
dilution caused by the issuance of common stock as dividends on our preferred
stock

   in july of 2002 we repurchased 85 million shares of our common stock for
183 million in cash the shares purchased by us represented all of the
remaining shares previously owned by affiliates of france telecom the purchase
was conducted through a privately negotiated transaction we utilized cash from
an unrestricted investment subsidiary to effect the stock repurchase

   in september 2002 crown atlantic repaid 500 million in outstanding
borrowings under its credit facility crown atlantic utilized cash provided by
its operations to effect this repayment

   in august and september of 2002 we began repurchasing our stock both
common and preferred and debt securities in public market transactions
through december of 2002 we repurchased debt securities with an aggregate
principal amount at maturity of 2446 million such debt securities had an
aggregate carrying value net of unamortized discounts of 2265 million we
utilized 1428 million in cash 965 million from an unrestricted investment
subsidiary and 463 million from ccic to effect these debt repurchases the
debt repurchases resulted in gains of 791 million through december of 2002
we repurchased shares of preferred stock with an aggregate redemption amount of
1629 million such shares of preferred stock had an aggregate carrying value
net of unamortized issue costs of 1604 million we utilized 610 million
in cash from an unrestricted investment subsidiary to effect these preferred
stock repurchases the preferred stock repurchases resulted in gains of 994
million such gains are offset against dividends on preferred stock in
determining the net loss applicable to common stock for the calculation of loss
per common share when the debt and preferred stock repurchases are added
together we have spent approximately 2038 million in cash to retire
securities with aggregate principal and redemption amounts at maturity of
approximately 4074 million these repurchases at an average discount to par
value of approximately 50 represent an attractive use of our liquidity and
the future interest savings will enhance our cash flow from operating
activities through december of 2002 we also repurchased a total of 15
million shares of common stock we utilized 30 million in cash from an
unrestricted investment subsidiary to effect these common stock repurchases

   in march of 2003 we repurchased additional shares of our preferred stock in
a public market transaction such shares of preferred stock had an aggregate
redemption amount and carrying value of 127 million we utilized 94 million
in cash from an unrestricted investment subsidiary to effect this march
preferred stock repurchase the march preferred stock repurchase resulted in a
gain of 33 million

   we seek to allocate our available capital among the investment alternatives
that provide the greatest returns given current market conditions as such we
may continue to acquire sites build new towers and make improvements to
existing towers when the expected returns from such expenditures meet our
investment criteria in addition we may continue to utilize a portion of our
available cash balances to repurchase our own stock either common or
preferred or debt securities from time to time as market prices make such
investments attractive

   in april 2002 itv digital itvd a significant customer of ccuk
announced plans to liquidate its assets and returned its digital terrestrial
television multiplex licenses to the uk independent television commission see
item 1 businessthe companyuk operationstransmission businessdigital
transmission and broadcast freeview the termination of the itvd
transmission contract was a termination event a defined event of default
under ccuks credit facility in november 2002 we obtained an amendment to
ccuks credit facility such that the termination event was cured the amended
ccuk credit facility consists of a pounds1200 million approximately 1931
million secured revolving loan facility since we were able to obtain an
amendment to ccuks credit facility the termination of the itvd transmission
contract did not result in an event of default under the trust deed governing
the ccuk bonds none of our other debt instruments including our public debt
securities and the two us bank credit facilities contained default
provisions related to the itvd transmission contract furthermore none of
these other debt instruments contain cross default provisions with either of
the ccuk debt instruments as such the events of default under the two ccuk
debt instruments did not constitute events of default under any of our other
debt instruments

   as of march 17 2003 crown atlantic had unused borrowing availability under
its amended credit facility of approximately 845 million and ccuk had unused
borrowing availability under its amended credit facility of approximately
pounds300 million 483 million as of march 17 2003 our restricted us
and australian subsidiaries had approximately 3676 million of unused
borrowing availability under the 2000 credit facility our various credit
facilities require our subsidiaries to maintain certain financial covenants and
place restrictions on the ability of our subsidiaries to among other things
incur debt and liens pay dividends make capital expenditures undertake
transactions with affiliates and make investments these facilities also limit
the ability of the borrowing subsidiaries to pay dividends to ccic

   the primary factors that determine our subsidiaries ability to comply with
their debt covenants are 1 their current financial performance as defined in
the various credit agreements 2 their levels of indebtedness and 3 their
debt service requirements since we do not currently expect that our
subsidiaries will need to utilize significant additional borrowings under their
credit facilities the primary risk of a debt covenant violation would result
from a deterioration of a subsidiarys financial performance in addition
certain of the credit facilities will require that financial performance
increase in future years as covenant calculations become more restrictive
should a covenant violation occur in the future as a result of a shortfall in
financial performance or for any other reason we might be required to make
principal payments earlier than currently scheduled and may not have access to
additional borrowings under these facilities as long as the covenant violation
continues any such early principal payments would have to be made from our
existing cash balances

   if we are unable to refinance our subsidiary debt or renegotiate the terms
of such debt we may not be able to meet our debt service requirements
including interest payments on the notes in the future our 10 58 discount
notes our 9 senior notes our 912 senior notes our 1034 senior notes and
our 9 38 senior notes require annual cash interest payments of approximately
254 million 149 million 109 million 476 million and 382 million
respectively prior to may 15 2004 and august 1 2004 the interest expense on
our 10 38 discount notes and our 1114 discount notes respectively will be
comprised solely of the amortization of original issue discount thereafter
the 10 38 discount notes and the 1114 discount notes will require annual
cash interest payments of approximately 466 million and 228 million
respectively prior to december 15 2003 we do not expect to pay cash
dividends on our 1234 exchangeable preferred stock or if issued cash
interest on the exchange debentures thereafter assuming all dividends or
interest have been paidinkind our exchangeable preferred stock or if
issued the exchange debentures will require annual cash dividend or interest
payments of approximately 343 million annual cash interest payments on the
ccuk bonds are pounds1125 million 181 million in addition our various
credit facilities will require periodic interest payments on amounts borrowed
thereunder which amounts could be substantial

   as a holding company ccic will require distributions or dividends from its
subsidiaries or will be forced to use capital raised in debt and equity
offerings to fund its debt obligations including interest payments on the
cashpay notes and eventually the 10 38 discount notes and the 1114
discount notes the terms of the indebtedness of our subsidiaries significantly
limit their ability to distribute cash to ccic as a result we will be
required to apply a portion of the net proceeds from the debt offerings to fund
interest payments on the notes if we do not retain sufficient funds from the
offerings or any future financing we may not be able to make our interest
payments on the notes

with certain contingent retirement obligations under various tower site land

amounts aggregating 85 million and expire on various dates through october

   our ability to make scheduled payments of principal of or to pay interest
on our debt obligations and our ability to refinance any such debt
obligations will depend on our future performance which to a certain extent
is subject to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory
and other factors that are beyond our control in addition our ability to
refinance any indebtedness in the future would depend in part on our
maintaining adequate credit ratings from the commercial rating agencies such
credit ratings are dependent on all the liquidity and performance factors
discussed above as well as general expectations that the rating agencies have
regarding the outlook for our business and our industry we anticipate that we
may need to refinance a substantial portion of our indebtedness on or prior to
its scheduled maturity there can be no assurance that we will be able to
effect any required refinancings of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable

and closed our development offices in brazil and europe the actions taken for
the restructuring were substantially completed as of the end of 2001 in
connection with the restructuring we recorded cash charges of approximately
194 million during 2001 related to employee severance payments 139
million and costs of office closures 55 million

   for the year ended december 31 2002 we recorded cash charges of 85
million in connection with a restructuring of our ccuk business announced in

primarily to additional employee severance payments at our corporate office in
connection with the july 2001 restructuring in october 2002 we announced a
restructuring of our us business in order to flatten its organizational
structure to better align with customer demand and enhance our regional focus
to improve customer service as part of the restructuring we are reducing our

   we have recorded asset writedown charges of 249 million during 2001 in
connection with the restructuring of our business announced in july 2001 such
noncash charges related to the writedown of certain inventories 119
million property and equipment 85 million and other assets 45
million that were deemed to have no value as a result of the restructuring

   during the year ended december 31 2002 we abandoned a portion of our
construction in process related to certain open projects mutually agreed to
terminate certain buildtosuit agreements and wrote down the value of the
related construction in process wrote down the value of certain inventories
and wrote down the value of three office buildings as a result we have
recorded asset writedown charges of 392 million for ccusa 111 million for
crown atlantic and 23 million for the corporate office for the year ended
december 31 2002 we also recorded asset writedown charges of 32 million
for ccuk related to certain inventories and property and equipment we will
continue to evaluate the carrying value of our goodwill and our property and
equipment as required by sfas 142 and sfas 144 implicit in the determination
of fair value for such longlived assets are certain assumptions regarding the
future leasing of our communication sites should future business conditions
require the amendment of previous assumptions our assets could be deemed
impaired and a charge to earnings would be required

ccuk take or pay agreements

   ccuk is a party to two agreements that contemplate a minimum level of site
leasing and contain certain take or pay commitments by the carriers one
agreement contemplates that at least 1000 sites will be annually leased for a
total of 4000 sites by 2005 the other agreement contemplates that at least
1500 sites will be leased by 2004 in each case the carrier is not leasing
the number of sites within the time period contemplated by the agreement and is
disputing the terms it is likely that the carriers will not need the full
number of sites originally contemplated ccuk is working with the carriers to
resolve differences and to find viable commercial alternatives to maintain good
relationships with such carriers it is possible that some form of negotiated
settlement will occur that would relieve the carriers of their site leasing
commitments however there can be no assurance that satisfactory results will
be achieved in either situation

options to purchase 17577 shares of our common stock with an exercise price of
01 per share in connection with an acquisition by ccuk such shares and
options were deemed to be compensation to the former shareholders of the
acquired company who remained employed by the company as a result ccuk will
recognize noncash general and administrative compensation charges of
approximately 84 million over five years

   in september 2000 we issued 336600 shares of our common stock in
connection with an acquisition by ccusa of such shares 170710 were deemed to

impact of recently issued accounting standards

   in june 2001 the financial accounting standards board the fasb issued
statement of financial accounting standards no 141 business combinations
sfas 141 and statement of financial accounting standards no 142 goodwill
and other intangible assets sfas 142 sfas 141 prohibits the use of the
poolingofinterests method of accounting for business combinations and
requires that the purchase method be used for all business combinations after
june 30 2001 sfas 141 also changes the manner in which acquired intangible
assets are identified and recognized apart from goodwill further sfas 141
requires additional disclosures regarding the reasons for business
combinations the allocation of the purchase price to recognized assets and
liabilities and the recognition of goodwill and other intangible assets we
have used the purchase method of accounting since our inception so the
adoption of sfas 141 will not change our method of accounting for business
combinations we have adopted the other recognition and disclosure requirements
of sfas 141 as of july 1 2001 for any future business combinations the
transition provisions of sfas 141 require that the carrying amounts for
goodwill and other intangible assets acquired in prior purchase method business
combinations be reviewed and reclassified in accordance with the new
recognition rules such reclassifications are to be made in conjunction with
the adoption of sfas 142 the application of these transition provisions of
sfas 141 as of january 1 2002 resulted in a reclassification of other
intangible assets with finite useful lives the value of site rental contracts
from the acquisition of crown communication to deferred financing costs and
other assets on our consolidated balance sheet the gross carrying amount
accumulated amortization and net book value of such reclassified intangible
assets were approximately 260 million 115 million and 145 million at
january 1 2002 respectively and 260 million 129 million and 131
million at december 31 2002 respectively the net book value of these
intangible assets will be amortized using a revised life of 10 years resulting
in amortization expense of approximately 15 million for each of the years
ending december 31 2002 through 2007 we have no other intangible assets from
prior business combinations

   sfas 142 changes the accounting and disclosure requirements for acquired
goodwill and other intangible assets the most significant provision of sfas
142 is that goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives
will no longer be amortized but rather will be tested for impairment on an
annual basis this annual impairment test will involve 1 a step to identify
potential impairment at a reporting unit level based on fair values and 2 a
step to measure the amount of the impairment if any intangible assets with
finite useful lives will continue to be amortized over such lives and tested
for impairment in accordance with our existing policies sfas 142 requires
disclosures about goodwill and other intangible assets in the periods
subsequent to their acquisition including 1 changes in the carrying amount
of goodwill in total and by operating segment 2 the carrying amounts of
intangible assets subject to amortization and those which are not subject to
amortization 3 information about impairment losses recognized and 4 the
estimated amount of intangible asset amortization expense for the next five
years the provisions of sfas 142 are effective for fiscal years beginning
after december 15 2001 in addition the nonamortization provisions of sfas
142 were to be immediately applied for goodwill and other intangible assets
acquired in business combinations subsequent to june 30 2001 we have adopted
the requirements of sfas 142 as of january 1 2002 sfas 142 requires that
transitional impairment tests be performed at its adoption and provides that
resulting impairment losses for goodwill and other intangible assets with
indefinite useful lives be reported as the effect of a change in accounting
principle we have completed our transitional impairment tests and have
determined that no impairment losses for goodwill and other intangible assets
were to be recorded upon the adoption of sfas 142 our depreciation and
amortization expense has decreased by approximately 606 million per year as a
result of the adoption of sfas 142 if amortization of goodwill had not been
recorded and if amortization of other intangible assets had been recorded
using the revised life our net loss and loss per share for the years ended
december 31 2000 2001 and 2002 would have been 1581 million 122 per
share 3045 million 179 per share and 2725 million 116 per share
respectively

   during the fourth quarter of 2002 we performed our annual update of the
impairment test for goodwill the results of this test indicate that goodwill
is not impaired at any of our reporting units however the amount by which the
estimated fair value for ccusa exceeds its carrying value has declined since
january 1 2002 this decline is a function of our reduced forecasts for site
leasing and antenna installation revenues as indicated by our operating
results for 2002 further declines in our site leasing and network services
business at ccusa could result in an impairment of goodwill in the future
furthermore if an impairment at ccusa were to occur in the future we believe
that the calculations to measure the impairment could result in the writeoff
of substantially all of ccusas goodwill 1640 million due to the continued
weakness in the telecommunications industry we intend to closely monitor the
performance of our reporting units in 2003 in order to assess whether a
goodwill impairment is indicated

   in june 2001 the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards
no 143 accounting for asset retirement obligations sfas 143 sfas 143
addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with
the retirement of tangible longlived assets and the related asset retirement
costs the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation is to
be recognized in the period in which it is incurred and can be reasonably
estimated such asset retirement costs are to be capitalized as part of the
carrying amount of the related longlived asset and depreciated over the
assets estimated useful life fair value estimates of liabilities for asset
retirement obligations will generally involve discounted future cash flows
periodic accretion of such liabilities due to the passage of time is to be
recorded as an operating expense the provisions of sfas 143 are effective for
fiscal years beginning after june 15 2002 with initial application as of the
beginning of the fiscal year we will adopt the requirements of sfas 143 as of
january 1 2003 and have not yet determined the effect that such adoption will
have on our consolidated financial statements however we do expect that
contingent retirement obligations under certain of our tower site land leases
will require recognition as liabilities under sfas 143

   in august 2001 the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards
no 144 accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets sfas
144 sfas 144 supersedes statement of financial accounting standards no 121
accounting for the impairment of longlived assets and for longlived assets to
be disposed of sfas 121 but retains many of its fundamental provisions
sfas 144 also clarifies certain measurement and classification issues from sfas
121 in addition sfas 144 supersedes the accounting and reporting provisions
for the disposal of a business segment as found in accounting principles board
opinion no 30 reporting the results of operationsreporting the effects of
disposal of a segment of a business and extraordinary unusual and
infrequently occurring events and transactions apb 30 however sfas 144
retains the requirement in apb 30 to separately report discontinued operations
and broadens the scope of such requirement to include more types of disposal
transactions the scope of sfas 144 excludes goodwill and other intangible
assets that are not to be amortized as the accounting for such items is
prescribed by sfas 142 the provisions of sfas 144 are effective for fiscal
years beginning after december 15 2001 and are to be applied prospectively
the adoption of the requirements of sfas 144 as of january 1 2002 had no
impact on our consolidated financial statements

extinguishment of debt sfas 4 sfas 4 required that gains and losses from
extinguishment of debt that were included in the determination of net income or
loss be aggregated and if material classified as an extraordinary item net
of related income tax effect upon adoption of sfas 145 gains and losses from
extinguishment of debt will no longer be classified as an extraordinary item
but rather will generally be classified as part of other income expense on
our consolidated statement of operations any such gains or losses classified
as an extraordinary item in prior periods will be reclassified in future
financial statement presentations the provisions of sfas 145 related to the
rescission of sfas 4 are effective for fiscal years beginning after may 15
2002 with early application encouraged we have adopted the provisions of sfas
145 as of january 1 2002

emerging issues task force issue no 943 liability recognition for certain
employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including
certain costs incurred in a restructuring eitf 943 sfas 146 requires
that costs associated with exit or disposal activities be recognized when they

plan as provided by eitf 943 examples of costs covered by sfas 146 include
certain employee severance costs and lease termination costs that are
associated with a restructuring or discontinued operation the provisions of
sfas 146 are effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after december
31 2002 and are to be applied prospectively we will adopt the requirements
of sfas 146 as of january 1 2003

   in december 2002 the fasb issued statement of financial accounting

sfas 148 amends the provisions of sfas 123 to require more prominent
disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of
accounting for stockbased employee compensation and the effect of the method
used on reported results of operations we have adopted the disclosure
requirements of sfas 148 as of december 31 2002

   in january 2003 the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 46 consolidation

literature regarding the consolidation of entities in which a company holds a
controlling financial interest a majority voting interest in an entity has
generally been considered indicative of a controlling financial interest fin

item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

   as a result of our international operating investing and financing
activities we are exposed to market risks which include changes in foreign
currency exchange rates and interest rates which may adversely affect our
results of operations and financial position in attempting to minimize the
risks andor costs associated with such activities we seek to manage exposure
to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates where
economically prudent to do so

   certain of the financial instruments we have used to obtain capital are
subject to market risks from fluctuations in market interest rates the
majority of our financial instruments however are longterm fixed interest
rate notes and debentures a fluctuation in market interest rates of one
percentage point in 2003 would impact our interest expense by approximately
94 million as of december 31 2002 we have approximately 10949 million
of floating rate indebtedness of which 1500 million has been effectively
converted to fixed rate indebtedness through the use of interest rate swap
agreements

   the majority of our foreign currency transactions are denominated in the
british pound sterling or the australian dollar which are the functional
currencies of ccuk and ccal respectively as a result of ccuks and ccals
transactions being denominated and settled in such functional currencies the
risks associated with currency fluctuations are generally limited to foreign
currency translation adjustments we do not currently hedge against foreign
currency translation risks and believe that foreign currency exchange risk is
not significant to our operations

item 1 business

overview

   we are a leading owner and operator including via lesseesublessee and
management arrangements of towers including colocatable rooftops and
transmission networks for wireless communications and broadcast transmission
companies as of december 31 2001 we owned leased or managed 15116 towers
and rooftops including 10638 sites in the united states and puerto rico
3087 sites in the united kingdom and 1391 sites in australia our customers
currently include many of the worlds major wireless communications and
broadcast companies including verizon cingular nextel voicestream sprint
pcs att wireless singtel optus vodafone bt cellnet an mmo2 company one
2 one hutchison 3g uk limited and the british broadcasting corporation the
bbc

   our strategy is to use our leading domestic and international position to
increase our revenue per site by increasing the utilization of our sites by
wireless and broadcast companies for antenna space and to continue to build
acquire and operate new towers and wireless and transmission networks and
infrastructure through opportunities created by

    the transfer to third parties or outsourcing of tower ownership and
     management by major wireless carriers

    the need for existing wireless carriers to expand coverage and improve
     network capacity

    the additional demand for towers and wireless infrastructure created by
     new entrants into the wireless communications industry and

    the introduction of wireless technologies including broadband data or
     3g technology

   our main businesses are leasing including licensing antenna space on
wireless and broadcast towers that can accommodate multiple tenants co
location and operating analog and digital broadcast transmission networks
and wireless networks we also provide related services to our customers
including network design radio frequency engineering site acquisition site
development and project management antenna installation and network
management and maintenance we believe that our service capabilities and asset
portfolio are key competitive advantages in capturing a significant share of
the antenna demand by wireless communications carriers and the demand for
broadcast transmission network management

   our primary business in the united states is the leasing of antenna space
on our sites to wireless carriers our tower portfolio consists primarily of
concentrations of towers in various metropolitan areas or tower clusters
we believe that by owning and managing large tower clusters we are able to
offer customers the ability to fulfill rapidly and efficiently their network
expansion and coverage plans across particular markets or regions as of
december 31 2001 52 of our towers were located in the 50 largest basic
trading areas or btas in the us and 70 of our towers were located in
the 100 largest btas

   our primary businesses in the united kingdom which is conducted through
our wholly owned subsidiary crown castle uk limited or ccuk are the
operation of television and radio broadcast transmission networks and the
leasing of antenna space to wireless carriers following our 1997 acquisition
of the bbcs broadcast and tower infrastructure we were awarded longterm
contracts to provide the bbc and other broadcasters analog and digital
transmission services we also lease antenna space to wireless operators in
the united kingdom on the towers we acquired from the bbc as well as on
various towers that we acquired from wireless carriers or that we have
constructed ccuk has executed agreements with certain 3g license holders in
the uk pursuant to which such license holders will lease space on certain ccuk
sites which are expected to be used in connection with such companies 3g

   our primary business in australia which is conducted through crown castle
australia pty limited or ccal is the leasing of antenna space to wireless
carriers ccal is owned 776 by us and 224 by permanent nominees aust ltd
on behalf of a group of professional and institutional investors led by jump
capital limited we currently operate 1391 towers in australia of which 716
were purchased from cable  wireless optus now singtel optus pty limited or
optus during 2000 and 643 were purchased from vodafone australia in april
2001 these towers provide ccal with a strategic presence in all of
australias licensed regions including sydney melbourne brisbane adelaide
and perth ccal is now the largest independent tower owner in australia see
businessthe companyaustralia operations

   we believe our towers are attractive to a diverse range of wireless
communications industries including personal communications services
cellular enhanced specialized mobile radio specialized mobile radio 3g
paging and fixed microwave as well as radio and television broadcasting in
the united states our major customers include verizon cingular voicestream
nextel sprint pcs and att wireless in the united kingdom our major
customers include the bbc bt cellnet an mmo2 company ntl itvdigital
formerly called ondigital one 2 one orange and hutchison 3g our principal
customers in australia are optus vodafone australia and hutchison

   we are continuing our ongoing construction program to strategically expand
our tower portfolios in 2001 we constructed 1464 towers in 2002 we plan
to construct approximately 900 to 1100 towers at an estimated aggregate cost
of approximately 185 million excluding payments under our british telecom
agreement for lease to wireless carriers such as verizon cingular nextel
hutchison 3g and bt cellnet an mmo2 company the actual number of towers
built may vary depending on acquisition opportunities and potential buildto
suit contracts from our wireless customers

growth strategy

   our objective is to become the premier owner and operator of tower
including colocatable rooftop sites and transmission networks for wireless
communications and broadcast companies we believe our experience in expanding
and marketing our tower clusters as well as our experience in owning and
operating analog and digital transmission networks positions us to accomplish
this objective the key elements of our business strategy are to

    grow revenue organically we are seeking to increase the utilization of
     our strategically located communications sites by increasing the number
     of antenna leases on our owned and managed communications sites many of
     our towers have capacity available for additional antenna space rental
     we believe there is demand for such colocation capacity both from
     existing carriers and broadcasters and from new carriers and
     broadcasters new entrants are able to launch service quickly and
     efficiently by designing the deployment of their networks based on our
     existing tower portfolios we intend to continue to use targeted sales
     and marketing techniques to increase utilization of and investment
     return on our constructed and acquired towers

    grow ebitda we are seeking to take advantage of the operating leverage
     afforded by the relatively fixed nature of the operating costs
     associated with our site rental business the majority of the operating
     costs of our site rental business consist of ground lease expense
     property taxes repair and maintenance utilities and salaries which
     tend to escalate at approximately the rate of inflation consequently
     if increased utilization of tower capacity is achieved at low
     incremental cost our site rental business should experience operating
     margin expansion and growth in sitelevel ebitda or earnings before
     interest taxes and depreciation

    allocate capital efficiently we seek to expand our existing tower
     portfolios through the selective acquisition and build of strategically
     located towers that will improve the coverage of our existing tower
     portfolios and increase their attractiveness with respect to tower
     acquisitions we may seek to acquire such sites from major wireless
     carriers to assume ownership of their existing towers directly or
     through

                                       2
page

    joint ventures such as our two joint ventures with verizon
    communications or to control their towers through contractual
    arrangements we may also acquire towers from other companies in the
    tower industry either through direct acquisitions tower exchanges or
    other means with respect to tower builds leveraging on our ability to
    offer a wide range of related services we intend to selectively build
    new towers for wireless carriers as they expand and fill in their service
    areas and deploy new technologies requiring additional communications
    sites our decisions to invest additional capital in selective
    acquisitions or build activities are generally based upon whether such
    investments are expected to achieve our riskadjusted return on
    investment hurdle rates

    extend revenue around our existing assets we are seeking to leverage
     the skills of our personnel in the united states the united kingdom and
     australia we believe that our ability to manage networks including the
     transmission of signals will be an important competitive advantage in
     our pursuit of growth opportunities as evidenced by our transactions
     with the bbc one 2 one verizon communications bellsouth powertel
     optus and vodafone australia with our wireless communications and
     broadcast transmission network design and radio frequency engineering
     expertise we are well positioned to extend our services beyond the
     leasing of tower space to other potentially shareable activities such
     as antenna and base station maintenance shared microwave backhaul and
     network monitoring

our common stock then held by the venture that were contributed by us as
capital contributions all of which shares will be distributed to the
applicable verizon communications partner in exchange for the distribution of
the ventures assets to us we will pay to the applicable verizon
communications partner the then fair market value of such partners interest
in the venture excluding an agreed venture interest relating to the common
stock held by the venture and distributed to such partner a dissolution of
either venture may be triggered 1 by the verizon communications partner at
any time following the third anniversary of the formation of the applicable
venture and 2 by us at any time following the fourth anniversary of such
ventures formation subject to certain penalties if prior to the seventh
anniversary in the case of the bell atlantic jv as of december 31 2001
assuming the distribution of the shares of common stock held by the ventures
to the verizon communications partner the interest of the verizon
communications partner in the gte jv and the bell atlantic jv would have been
approximately 110 and 241 respectively as payment to our venture
partner the dissolution of the gte jv would require us to deliver cash and
the dissolution of the bell atlantic jv would require us to deliver cash or
common stock at our option such payments may negatively impact our liquidity
or cause dilution of our common stock the gte jv was formed on january 31
2000 and the bell atlantic jv was formed on march 31 1999 additional
information regarding the joint venture dissolution terms can be found in the
text of our prior filings with the securities and exchange commission sec
and in the relevant joint venture agreements which have been filed as
exhibits to certain of our prior sec filings

   each of our joint ventures with verizon communications entered into master
buildtosuit agreements under which each joint venture will build and own up
to 500 additional towers to be built for the wireless communications business
of bell atlantic mobile and gte wireless which now does business as verizon
wireless over a fiveyear period in addition following the building of such
500 sites the bell atlantic jv will have a right of first refusal to
construct up to the next 200 towers to be built for verizon wireless the

of towers built under the gte jv buildtosuit agreement is reduced by the
number of towers built under the bell atlantic jv buildtosuit agreement in
excess of 700 and certain other leases on our towers further we have entered
into similar agreements with bellsouth as part of the bellsouth transaction
to construct certain towers on behalf of bellsouth in the region covered by
that transaction over the five year period following the initial closing of
that transaction as of december 31 2001 we had built approximately 122 170
and 318 towers under each of the buildtosuit agreements with or for the gte
jv the bell atlantic jv and bellsouth respectively we are currently in
discussions with verizon communicatioins and bellsouth mobility regarding
amendments to various terms of each of the buildtosuit agreements with or
for the gte jv the bell atlantic jv and bellsouth mobility there can be no
assurances as to the outcome of any of these discussions

   we also seek to capitalize on our network design and project management
expertise to construct new towers we plan to continue to selectively build
towers in areas where carriers signals fail to transmit in their coverage
areas the areas commonly known as dead zones are attractive tower
locations when population density and perceived demand are such that we
believe the economics of constructing such towers are justified we build
towers that can accommodate multiple tenants the multiple tenant design of
these towers obviates the need for expensive and time consuming modifications
to upgrade undersized towers saving critical capital and time for carriers
facing timetomarket constraints the tower sites are also designed to easily
add additional customers

   site rental

   in the united states we rent antenna space on our towers to a variety of
carriers operating cellular personal communication services specialized
mobile radio enhanced specialized mobile radio paging and other networks

   we lease space to our customers on our towers we generally receive fees
for installing customers equipment and antennas on a tower and also receive
monthly rental payments from customers payable under site leases in the
united states the new leases typically entered into by us have original
terms of five years with three or four optional renewal periods of five years
each and provide for annual price increases based primarily on the consumer
price index the average monthly rental payment of a new tenant added to a
tower is approximately 1500 per month the lease agreements relating to
tower network acquisitions generally have a base term of ten years with
multiple renewal options each typically ranging from five to ten years we
have existing master lease agreements with most major wireless carriers
including att wireless cingular verizon voicestream nextel and sprint
pcs which provide certain terms including economic terms that govern leases
on our towers entered into by such parties during the term of their master
lease agreements

   we have site rental opportunities in connection with our larger tower
acquisition transactions as a result of the fact that such transactions
typically involve a master lease agreement of some type with the transferring
carrier and the opportunity to lease additional space with other carriers for
example in connection with each of the joint ventures with verizon
communications we entered into a master lease agreement under which its
domestic wireless businesses lease antenna space on the towers transferred to
the joint ventures as well as the towers built under the buildtosuit
agreements also in connection with the bellsouth mobility and bellsouth dcs
transactions we are paid a monthly site maintenance fee from bellsouth for
its use or maintenance of its reserve space on the towers we control further
in connection with the powertel acquisition we entered into an agreement
under which the sellers rent space on the towers we acquired from them in
each of these transactions we are permitted to lease additional space on the
towers to third parties

   network services

   we design build and operate our own communication sites we have developed
an inhouse expertise in certain valueadded services that we offer to the
wireless communications industry because we are basically a provider of total
systems with endtoend design project management and operating expertise
we offer our customers the flexibility of choosing between the provision of a
readytooperate network infrastructure or any

of the component services involved therein such services include network
design and site selection site acquisition site development and project
management and antenna installation

   network design and site selection we have extensive experience in network
design and engineering and site selection while we maintain sophisticated
network design services primarily to support the location and construction of
our multiple tenant towers we do from time to time provide network design
and site selection services to carriers and other customers on a consulting
contract basis our network design and site selection services provide our
customers with relevant information including recommendations regarding
location and height of towers appropriate types of antennas transmission
power and frequency selection and related fixed network considerations in
2001 we provided network design services primarily for our own portfolios and
also for certain customers including att fixed wireless and cricket
communications these customers were typically charged on a timeandmaterials
basis

   site acquisition in the united states we are engaged in site acquisition
services for our own purposes and for third parties based on data generated
in the network design and site selection process a search ring generally
of a onemile radius is issued to the site acquisition department for
verification of possible land purchases or leases within the search ring
within each search ring geographic information systems specialists select the
most suitable sites based on demographics traffic patterns and signal
characteristics once a site is selected and the terms of an option to
purchase or lease the site are completed a survey is prepared and the
resulting site plan is created the plan is then submitted to the local
zoningplanning board for approval if the site is approved our project
management department takes over the process of constructing the site

   we have provided site acquisition services to numerous customers including
verizon cingular att fixed wireless att wireless and cricket
communications these customers engage us for such site acquisition services
on either a fixed price contract or a timeandmaterials basis

   site development and project management and antenna installation we
provide site development and project management and antenna installation
services to the us communications industry we have extensive experience in
the development and construction of tower sites and the installation of
antenna microwave dishes and associated equipment our site development and
project management services include clearing sites laying foundations
provision of electrical and telecommunications lines and constructing
equipment shelters and towers we have designed and built and presently
maintain tower sites for a number of our wireless communications customers and
also for a substantial part of our own tower network we can provide cost
effective and timely completion of construction projects in part because our
site development personnel are crosstrained in site development project
management and antenna installation we generally set prices for each site
development or project management service separately customers are billed for
these services on a fixed price or timeandmaterials basis and we may
negotiate fees on individual sites or for groups of sites we have the
capability expertise and contractual arrangements to install antenna systems
for our paging cellular personal communications services specialized mobile
radio enhanced specialized mobile radio and microwave customers as this
service is performed we use our technical expertise to substantiate that
there is no interference with other tenants we typically bill for our antenna
installation services on a fixed price basis

   our project management capabilities reflect our extensive experience in the
managing the construction of networks and towers for example during 2001 we
were instrumental in launching a multistate network for cricket
communications in addition in 2001 we provided site development and project
management or antenna installation services to a majority of our new tower
site tenants in the united states including verizon cingular att wireless
sprint pcs and nextel

   significant contracts

   we have many agreements with telecommunications providers in the united
states including leases site management contracts and independent contractor

   sales and marketing

   our marketing department maintains our profile within the industry through
regular advertising public relations trade shows press releases
newsletters targeted mailings and our website at wwwcrowncastlecom we use
numerous public and proprietary databases to develop targeted marketing
programs focused on regional network buildouts new sites and services
information about existing sites demographics licenses and deployment
status and actual signal strength measurements taken in the field are
combined to predict the service area of a particular radio signal from any
given transmission point this allows our sales and marketing personnel to
target specific carriers with specific sites

   a team of national account managers maintains and enhances our close
relationships with our largest customers these managers work to develop new
tower construction site leasing services and site management opportunities
as well as to ensure that customers emerging needs are translated into new
products and services this group also manages sales opportunities including
turnkey network deployments and backhaul transmission services

   sales personnel in our regional offices develop and maintain close local
relationships with carriers that are expanding their networks entering new
markets bringing new technologies to market or requiring maintenance or add
on business all types of wireless carriers are targeted including personal
communications services cellular microwave and twoway radio paging 911
government agencies and utility and transportation companies our objective
is to presell capacity on our new towers prior to construction and to lease
space on existing towers

   we seek to maintain good public and community relations at a local level
through efforts including community events sponsorships and charitable work
for example in 2001 we provided emergency communications services and
dispatched crank up towers nighttime lighting and other equipment to assist
the recovery efforts in new york city and at the pennsylvania crash site
associated with the terrorist events of september 11 2001

                                       7

   in addition to our fulltime sales and marketing staff a number of senior
managers spend a significant portion of their time on sales and marketing
activities these managers call on existing and prospective customers and also
seek greater visibility in the industry through speaking engagements and
articles in national publications furthermore many of these managers have
been recognized as industry experts are regularly quoted in articles are
called on to testify at local hearings and are asked to draft local zoning
ordinances

   competition

   in the united states we compete with other independent tower owners which
also provide site rental and network services wireless carriers which own
and operate their own tower networks service companies that provide
engineering and site acquisition services and other potential competitors
such as utilities outdoor advertisers broadcasters and building owners some
of which have already entered the tower industry wireless carriers that own
and operate their own tower networks generally are substantially larger and
have greater financial resources than we have we believe that tower location
capacity price quality of service deployment speed and density within a
geographic market historically have been and will continue to be the most
significant competitive factors affecting tower rental companies we also
compete for certain strategic acquisition and new tower construction
opportunities with wireless carriers site developers and other independent
tower operating companies we believe that competition for such tower site
acquisitions may increase and that additional competitors may enter the tower
market some of which may have greater financial resources than us

   the following is a list of the larger independent tower companies that we
compete with in the united states american tower corp spectrasite pinnacle
towers and sba communications

   we believe that the majority of our competitors in the site acquisition
business operate within local market areas exclusively while a small minority
of firms appear to offer their services nationally including us and wireless
facilities inc sba communications whalen  company a subsidiary of tetra
tech inc and gearon  company a subsidiary of american tower corp the
market includes participants from a variety of market segments offering
individual or a combination of competing services the field of competitors
includes site acquisition consultants zoning consultants real estate firms
rightofway consulting firms construction companies tower ownersmanagers
radio frequency engineering consultants telecommunications equipment vendors
which provide turnkey site development services through multiple
subcontractors and carriers internal staff we believe that carriers base
their decisions on site development services on criteria such as a companys
experience track record local reputation price and time for completion of a
project we believe that we compete favorably in these areas

 uk operations

   overview

   we own and operate through ccuk one of the worlds most established
television and radio transmission networks in addition we are expanding our
leasing of antenna space on our uk towers to a variety of wireless carriers
we provide transmission services for four of the six digital terrestrial
television multiplexes in the uk two bbc analog television services six
ukwide bbc radio services on fm am and dab the first digital audio
broadcast service in the united kingdom 5 bbc regional radio services for
scotland wales and northern ireland 39 local bbc radio stations and two
national commercial radio services through our network of transmitters which
reach 994 of the uk population these transmitters are located on
approximately 1300 sites more than half of which we own or control and the
balance of which are either licensed to us under a sitesharing agreement with
national transcommunications limited or ntl our principal broadcast
competitor in the united kingdom or other third party site operators we have
also secured longterm contracts to provide digital television transmission
services to the bbc and itvdigital formerly ondigital see businessthe
companyuk operationssignificant contracts in april 2001 we launched a
new wireless carrier network service for one 2 one in northern ireland in
addition to providing transmission services we also lease antenna

space on our 3087 communications sites in the united kingdom to various
communications service providers including one 2 one bt cellnet orange and
vodafone and provide telecommunications network installation and maintenance
services and engineering consulting services

   our core revenue generating activity in the united kingdom is the analog
and digital terrestrial transmission of radio and television programs
broadcast by the bbc ccuks transmission business which was formerly owned
by the bbc was privatized under the broadcasting act 1996 and sold to ccuk in
february 1997 at the time the bbc home service transmission business was
acquired ccuk entered into a 10year transmission contract with the bbc for
the provision of terrestrial analog television and analog and digital radio
transmission services in the united kingdom the digital tv contract was added
in 1998 as described below for the 12 months ended december 31 2001
approximately 394 of ccuks consolidated revenues were derived from the
provision of transmission services to the bbc

   at december 31 2001 we owned or managed 3087 sites in the united
kingdom our sites are located throughout england wales scotland and
northern ireland

   we expect to expand our existing portfolios in the united kingdom by
building and acquiring additional sites many of these new sites will be
developed on british telecom exchange sites under our agreement with british
telecom see businessthe companyuk operationssignificant contracts
british telecom agreement we believe our existing tower network encompasses
many of the most desirable tower locations in the united kingdom for wireless
communications however due to the shorter range over which communications
signals carry especially newer technologies such as 3g as compared to
broadcast signals wireless communications providers require a denser
portfolio of sites to cover a given area using our team of engineers who have
stateoftheart network design and radio frequency engineering expertise we
locate sites and design locations that will be attractive to multiple tenants
we seek to leverage such expertise by entering into new construction contracts
with various carriers such as bt cellnet vodafone hutchison 3g one 2 one
and orange thereby securing an anchor tenant for a site before incurring
capital expenditures for the site buildout

   in march 1999 ccuk completed the one 2 one transaction through this
transaction ccuk has added an aggregate of 1676 towers including towers
built pursuant to a buildtosuit agreement with one 2 one to its portfolio
these towers represent substantially all the towers in one 2 ones nationwide
900 mhz wireless network in the united kingdom these towers form part of
ccuks nationwide network of towers to be marketed to wireless carriers in the
united kingdom see businessthe companyuk operationssignificant
contractsone 2 one northern ireland network

   in november 2000 ccuk entered into an agreement with british telecom to
lease space on as many as 4000 british telecom exchange sites throughout the
united kingdom these sites are principally rooftop facilities owned by
british telecom in urban areas we spent approximately 991 million in 2001
developing the british telecom site portfolio for the deployment of wireless
services including second generation 2g and 3g services we expect to
invest an aggregate of approximately 325 million developing the british
telecom site portfolio we intend to integrate the new sites into our existing
portfolio of sites in the uk to provide a network that will offer operators
coverage of large population areas together with british telecom we will
also make available our technical expertise to help operators plan construct
operate and maintain their wireless networks as of december 31 2001 we had
developed 326 sites under this agreement we are currently in discussions with
british telecom regarding the deferral of certain payments that would
otherwise be owed by us to them in 2002 under this agreement there can be no
assurances as to the outcome of these discussions see businessthe
companyuk operationssignificant contractsbritish telecom agreement

   in february 2001 ccuk signed a definitive agreement with hutchison 3g uk
limited whereby hutchison 3g will lease space on a minimum of 4000 ccuk sites
throughout the united kingdom see businessthe companyuk operations

   transmission business

   analog for the 12 months ended december 31 2001 ccuk generated
approximately 324 of its revenues from the provision of analog broadcast
transmission services to the bbc under the bbc analog transmission contract
we provide terrestrial transmission services for the bbcs analog television
and radio programs and certain other related services including bbc digital
radio for an initial 10year term through march 31 2007 see businessthe
companyuk operationssignificant contractsbbc analog transmission
contract for the 12 months ended december 31 2001 the bbc analog
transmission contract generated revenues of approximately pounds534 million
769 million for us

   in addition to the bbc analog transmission contract we have separate
contracts to provide maintenance and transmission services for two national
radio stations virgin radio and talksport formerly talk radio in july
2001 the virgin radio contract was renewed for a period expiring april 30
2008 the talksport contract commenced on february 4 1995 and expires on
december 31 2008

   we own all of the transmission equipment used for broadcasting the bbcs
uk radio and television programs in the uk whether located on one of
ccuks sites or on an ntl or other thirdparty site as of december 31 2001
ccuk had 3847 transmitters of which 2546 were for television broadcasting
and 1301 were for radio

   a few of our most powerful television transmitters together cover the
majority of the uk population the coverage achieved by the less powerful
transmitters is relatively low but is important to the bbcs ambition of
attaining universal coverage in the united kingdom this is illustrated by the
following analysis of the population coverage of our analog television
transmitters

   all of our uk transmitters are capable of unmanned operation and are
maintained by mobile maintenance teams from 25 bases located across the united
kingdom the sitesharing agreement provides us with reciprocal access rights
to ntls broadcast transmission sites on which we have equipment

   certain of our transmitters that serve large populations or important
geographic areas have been designated as priority transmitters these
transmitters have duplicated equipment so that a single failure should not
result in total loss of service but will merely result in an outputpower
reduction that does not significantly degrade the service to most viewers and
listeners

   digital in january 2000 we completed the rollout of the 80 station
network required under our contracts with the holders including the bbc of
four of the six licenses issued in the uk for digital terrestrial television
services dtt we are required as part of our dtt contracts to provide new
transmission and distribution infrastructure networks and multiplex equipment
for our dtt customers including site upgrades new transmitters and
associated systems of these sites 49 are owned or controlled by us and the
remainder are on ntl owned or controlled towers pursuant to a site sharing
arrangement our costs to add new transmitters and associated systems was
approximately pounds1055 million 154 million for the 12 months ended

2001 our digital transmission contracts with the bbc and itvdigital generated
aggregate revenues of approximately pounds302 million 434 million for
us

   we successfully began commercial operation of the digital terrestrial
television networks from an initial 22 transmission sites on november 15
1998 we completed the 80 transmission site upgrade in january 2000 this
launch and the subsequent upgrade marked the first stage of the project to
introduce the digital broadcast system that is expected to eventually replace
conventional analog television services in the united kingdom initially in
january 2000 these first 80 sites achieved a national uk population
coverage in accordance with the revised definition of coverage by the
independent television commission of 56 of the uk population where service
from all six multiplexes overlap with an 81 coverage of the uk population
for the best individual multiplex we have accepted an invitation from the
uk television regulator the independent television commission to play a
role in planning further digital terrestrial television network extensions in
addition as of december 31 2001 the overlapping coverage for all six
multiplexes was improved from the initial 56 to 68 of the national
population as a result of coverage equalization projects which we initiated
and completed in consultation with our customers and uk government
regulators as a result of these projects our digital contract revenues have
increased by approximately pounds217 million 316 million per year

   in 1997 the independent television commission awarded itvdigital formerly
ondigital three of the five available commercial digital terrestrial
television multiplexes for new program services we bid for and won the 12
year contract from itvdigital to build and operate its digital television
transmission network the contract provides for approximately pounds190
million 276 million of revenue per year from 2001 to 2008 with lesser
amounts payable before and after these years and with service credits
repayable for performance below agreed thresholds additional revenues are
also being paid in relation to multiplex frequency equalization projects
initiated by ccuk in 2000 on march 27 2002 a uk court approved an
application by itvdigital to be placed into administration a proceeding
similar to a chapter 11 bankruptcy proceeding in the united states designed
to protect the applicant from the claims of its creditors while it reorganizes
its business there can be no assurances as to the outcome of this action or
its effect on us our primary concern will be any modification to our
itvdigital transmission contract resulting from these administration
proceedings we contemplate that itvdigital or its successor will continue to
honor its commitments under the transmission contract in order to continue
providing programming and services to its subscribers however any decisions
regarding the continuation of the transmission contract or payments by
itvdigital will involve the administrators itvdigital accounted for
approximately 34 of our revenues for the twelvemonth period ended december
31 2001 the loss of itvdigital as a customer or the modification of the
itvdigital transmission contract could have an adverse effect on our results

   we currently provide transmission services for digital radio broadcasts in
the united kingdom in 1995 the bbc launched over our transmission network
its initial national digital radio service and this service is now broadcast
to approximately 65 of the uk population a license for an independent
national digital radio network was awarded to the digital one consortium
during 1998 we are providing accommodation and access to towers and antennas
at 30 transmission sites for digital one services in addition local digital
radio licenses have been awarded since 1999 and on july 14 2000 we were
awarded a 12 year contract with switchdigital london limited to provide
their london local digital radio network service since that time ccuk has
been awarded two additional 12 year contracts by other switchdigital
consortia covering two areas of scotland site sharing for other digital
radio multiplexes provides additional revenues at 20 transmission sites

   site rental

   the bbc transmission network provides a valuable initial portfolio for the
creation of wireless communications networks as of december 31 2001
approximately 209 companies rented antenna space on ccuks 3087 towers these
site rental agreements have normally been for three to twelve years and are
generally subject to rent reviews every three years site sharing customers
are generally charged annually in advance according to ratecards that are
based on the antenna size and position on the tower our largest site rental
customer in the united kingdom is ntl under the sitesharing agreement and the
digital broadcasting site sharing agreement these agreements generated
approximately pounds125 million 182 million of site rental revenue for
the year ended december 31 2001

   as in the united states we provide a range of site maintenance services in
the united kingdom in order to support and enhance our site rental business
we complement our uk transmission experience with our site management
experience in the united states to provide customers with an enhanced package
of service and technical support

   other than ntl ccuks largest by revenue site rental customers consist
mainly of wireless carriers such as bt cellnet an mmo2 company one 2 one
orange and vodafone revenues from these nonbbc sources continue to become an
increasing portion of ccuks total uk revenue base we believe that the
demand for site rental from communication service providers will increase in
line with the expected growth of these communication services along with the
deployment of new technologies such as 3g in the united kingdom as
demonstrated by our multisite rental commitment contracts with hutchison 3g
and bt cellnet

   we have master lease agreements with all of the major uk
telecommunications site users including british telecom cable  wireless
communications bt cellnet one 2 one orange and vodafone these agreements
typically specify the terms and conditions including pricing and volume
discount plans under which these customers have access to all sites within
our uk portfolio customers make orders for specific sites using the
standard terms included in the master lease agreements

   network services

   ccuk provides broadcast and telecommunications engineering services to
various customers in the united kingdom we have engineering and technical
staff of the caliber and experience necessary not only to meet the
requirements of our current customer base but also to meet the challenges of
developing digital technology within the united kingdom ccuk has worked with
several telecommunications operators on design and build projects as they
rollout their networks with the expertise of our engineers and technical
staff we are a provider of complete systems to the wireless communications
and broadcast industries

   network design and site selection we have extensive experience in network

benefit of our sophisticated network design and site selection services

   in december 1999 ccuk and one 2 one entered into an agreement under which
ccuk would establish a turnkey mobile network for one 2 one in northern
ireland in april 2001 ccuk launched the network covering 947 of the
population of northern ireland ccuk provides cell planning acquisition
design build operation and maintenance services related to the network the
agreement with one 2 one is for an initial term of 11 years we currently own
and operate approximately 200 tower sites in northern ireland and one 2 one
is a tenant on substantially all of these sites as part of the network

   in june 2000 ccuk was awarded a contract for the first phase of a three
phase network rollout of europes first planned 3g network on the isle of man
in march 2001 ccuk was awarded a further contract with manx telecom for the
second and third phases the network comprised of approximately 28 sites was
built by nec and siemens for manx telecom a wholly owned subsidiary of mmo2
plc and was completed in september 2001 ccuk provided turnkey project
management installation and commissioning of the 3g radio access network
including site planning design build and radio frequency planning service
on the network was launched in december 2001

   site acquisition as in the united states in the united kingdom we are
involved in site acquisition services for our own purposes and for third
parties we recognize that the site acquisition phase often carries the
highest risk for a project to ensure the greatest possible likelihood of
success and timely acquisition we combine a desktop survey of potential
barriers to development with a physical site search with relevant analyses
assessments and where necessary surveys we seek to utilize our experience
in site acquisition and colocation when meeting with local planning
authorities

   site development and antenna installation we use a combination of external
and internal resources for site construction our engineers are experienced in
both construction techniques and project management ensuring

an efficient and simple construction phase selected civil contractors are
managed by ccuk staff for the ground works phase specialist erection
companies with whom we have a long association are used for tower
installation final antenna installation is project managed by our own teams

   significant contracts

   ccuks principal analog broadcast transmission contract is the bbc analog
transmission contract ccuk also has entered into two digital television
transmission contracts the bbc digital transmission contract and the
itvdigital formerly ondigital digital transmission contract under the site
sharing agreement ccuk also gives ntl access to facilities to provide
broadcast transmission to nonccuk customers ccuk also has longterm service
agreements with broadcast customers such as virgin radio talksport and
switchdigital in addition ccuk has several agreements with telecommunication
providers including leases site management contracts and independent
contractor agreements the agreements with hutchison 3g and bt cellnet
announced in february 2001 contain additional lease commitments for a minimum
of 5500 ccuk sites ccuk has also entered into contracts to design and build
infrastructure for customers such as bt cellnet one 2 one orange and
vodafone including the turnkey network contract for one 2 one in northern
ireland

   bbc analog transmission contract ccuk entered into a 10year transmission
contract with the bbc for the provision of terrestrial analog television and
analog and digital radio transmission services in the united kingdom at the
time the bbc home service transmission business was acquired the bbc analog
transmission contract provides for charges of approximately pounds465
million 676 million to be payable by the bbc to ccuk each year through the
termination date adjusted annually at the inflation rate less 1 in
addition for the duration of the contract an annual payment of
pounds300000 approximately 436000 is payable by the bbc for additional
broadcastrelated services at the bbcs request since october 1997 the
number of television broadcast hours has been increased to 24 hours per day
for the bbcs two national television services which has added over
pounds500000 approximately 727000 annually to the payments made by the
bbc to us on july 16 1999 the bbc and ccuk amended the transmission
contract to allow ccuk to provide certain liaison services to the bbc

   the bbc analog transmission contract also provides for ccuk to be liable to
the bbc for service credits ie rebates of its charges in the event that
certain standards of service are not attained as a result of what the contract
characterizes as accountable faults or the failure to meet certain response
times in relation to making repairs at certain key sites we believe that
ccuk is wellequipped to meet the bbcs service requirements by reason of the
collective experience its existing management gained while working with the
bbc ccuk is subject to periodic performance reviews and to date has incurred
no service credit penalties

   the initial term of the bbc analog transmission contract ends on march 31
2007 thereafter the bbc analog transmission contract may be terminated with
12 months prior notice by either of the parties expiring on march 31 in any
contract year from and including march 31 2007 it may also be terminated
earlier

    by mutual agreement between ccuk and the bbc

    by one party upon the bankruptcy or insolvency of the other party within
     the meaning of section 123 of the insolvency act 1986

    upon certain force majeure events with respect to the contract as a
     whole or with respect to any site in which case the termination will
     relate to that site only

    by the nondefaulting party upon a material breach by the other party
     and

    upon the occurrence of certain change of control events as defined in
     the bbc analog transmission contract

   it is contemplated that the bbc analog transmission contract will be
amended and extended in some manner however there can be no assurances that
any such modifications or extensions will come to pass

   bbc commitment agreement on february 28 1997 in connection with the
acquisition of the bbc home service transmission business the bbc the
company telediffusion de france international sa tdf and france telecom
tdfs parent company entered into a commitment agreement whereby we and tdf
agreed to maintain various minimum ownership interests in ccuk for periods
ranging from three to five years commencing february 28 1997 in july 1998
the bbc consented to the reduction of the ownership interest of tdf in ccuk to
20 in addition on july 5 2000 with the bbcs consent tdf divested its
remaining interest in ccuk and relinquished all of its governance rights in
ccuk as a result of recommendations by the department of trade and industry
in the united kingdom to the office of fair trading that as a condition to
not referring a proposed 25 equity investment in ntl by france telecom to the
competition commission tdf should undertake to dispose of its shareholding in
ccuk and the company concurrently with the disposition by tdf of its
remaining interest in ccuk ccuk became a wholly owned subsidiary of ours

   itvdigital digital transmission contract in 1997 the independent
television commission awarded itvdigital formerly ondigital three of the
five available commercial digital terrestrial television multiplexes for new
program services we bid for and won the 12year contract from itvdigital to
build and operate its digital television transmission network the contract
provides for approximately pounds190 million 276 million of revenue per
year from 2001 to 2008 with lesser amounts payable before and after these
years and with service credits repayable for performance below agreed
thresholds additional revenues are also being paid in relation to multiplex
frequency equalization projects initiated by ccuk in 2000 on march 27 2002
a uk court approved an application by itvdigital to be placed into
administration a proceeding similar to a chapter 11 bankruptcy proceeding in
the united states designed to protect the applicant from the claims of its
creditors while it reorganizes its business there can be no assurances as to
the outcome of this action or its effect on us our primary concern will be
any modification to our itvdigital transmission contract resulting from these
administration proceedings we contemplate that itvdigital or its successor
will continue to honor its commitments under the transmission contract in
order to continue providing programming and services to its subscribers
however any decisions regarding the continuation of the transmission contract
or payments by itvdigital will involve the administrators itvdigital
accounted for approximately 34 of our revenues for the twelvemonth period
ended december 31 2001 the loss of itvdigital as a customer or the
modification of the itvdigital transmission contract could have an adverse
effect on our results of operations see businessrisk factorsa
substantial portion of our revenues is derived from a small number of
customers including the bbc ntl itvdigital and verizon

   bbc digital transmission contract in 1998 we bid for and won the 12year
contract from the bbc to build and operate its digital terrestrial television
transmission network the bbc has committed to the full digital terrestrial
television rollout contemplated by the contract providing for approximately
pounds105 million 153 million of revenue per year during the 12year
period with service credits repayable for performance below agreed
thresholds there is a termination provision during the threemonth period
following the fifth anniversary of our commencement of digital terrestrial
transmission services for the bbc exercisable by the bbc but only if the
bbcs board of governors determines in its sole discretion that digital
television in the united kingdom does not have sufficient viewership to
justify continued digital television broadcasts under this provision the bbc
will pay us a termination fee in cash that substantially recovers our capital
investment in the network and any residual ongoing operating costs and
liabilities like the bbc analog transmission contract the contract is
terminable upon the occurrence of certain change of control events additional
revenues are also being paid in relation to multiplex frequency equalization
projects initiated by ccuk in 2000

   bt digital distribution contract under the bbc digital transmission
contract and the itvdigital digital transmission contract in addition to
providing digital terrestrial transmission services ccuk has agreed to
provide for the distribution of the bbcs and itvdigitals broadcast signals
from their respective television studios to ccuks transmission network
consequently in may 1998 ccuk entered into a 12year distribution contract
with british telecommunications plc with provisions for extending the term
in which british telecom has agreed to provide fully duplicated fiberbased
digital distribution services with penalties for late delivery and service
credits for failure to deliver 9999 availability

   sitesharing agreement in order to optimize service coverage for television
and radio services and to enable viewers to receive all analog uhf television
services using one receiving antenna the bbc as the predecessor to ccuk and
ntl made arrangements to share certain broadcast sites this arrangement was
introduced in the 1960s when uhf television broadcasting began in the united
kingdom in addition to service coverage advantages the arrangement also
minimizes costs and avoids the difficulties of obtaining additional sites

   on september 10 1991 the bbc and ntl entered into the sitesharing
agreement which set out the commercial site sharing terms under which the
parties were entitled to share each others sites for any television and radio
services

   under the sitesharing agreement the party that is the owner lessee or
licensee of each site is defined as the station owner the other party the
sharer is entitled to request a license to use certain facilities at that
site the sitesharing agreement and each site license provide for the station
owner to be paid a commercial license fee in accordance with the sitesharing
agreement ratecard and for the sharer to be responsible in normal
circumstances for the costs of accommodation and equipment used exclusively by
it the sitesharing agreement may be terminated with five years prior notice
on december 31 2005 or on any tenth anniversary of that date as no notice was
served in 2000 the next termination date is december 31 2015 it may also be
terminated

    following a material breach by either party that if remediable is not
     remedied within 30 days of notice of such breach by the nonbreaching
     party

    on the bankruptcy or insolvency of either party and

    if either party ceases to carry on a broadcast transmission business or
     function

   similar site sharing arrangements have been entered into between ntl and us
for the buildout of digital transmission sites and equipment including a
supplementary ratecard related to site sharing fees for new digital facilities
and revised operating and maintenance procedures related to digital equipment

   british telecom agreement in november 2000 ccuk entered into an agreement
with british telecom to lease space on as many as 4000 british telecom
exchange sites throughout the united kingdom we spent approximately 991
million in 2001 developing the british telecom site portfolio for the
deployment of wireless services including 2g and 3g services we expect to
invest an aggregate of approximately 325 million developing the british
telecom site portfolio we intend to integrate the new sites into our existing
portfolio of sites in the united kingdom to provide a network that will offer
operators coverage of large population areas together with british telecom we
will also make available our technical expertise to help operators plan
construct operate and maintain their wireless networks as of december 31
2001 we had developed 326 sites under this agreement we are currently in
discussions with british telecom regarding certain amendments to the agreement
including the deferral of certain payments that would otherwise be owed by us
to them in 2002 there can be no assurances as to the outcome of these
discussions in june 2001 ccuk signed a management services agreement to
manage the preexisting british telecom site sharing customers on the sites
subject to this agreement

   hutchison 3g agreement in february 2001 ccuk signed a definitive agreement
with hutchison 3g uk limited whereby hutchison 3g will lease space on a minimum

through 2004 throughout the united kingdom we are currently in discussions
with hutchison 3g regarding several potential amendments to this agreement
including one such amendment which may result in the deferral of hutchison 3gs
take or pay commitment for a period of up to six months ccuk is also currently
reviewing its standard terms of business and site share process including
establishing a definitive staged payment program as work on sites reaches
certain milestones this exercise is

year for each of 2001 2002 and 2003 bt cellnet did not satisfy the minimum
take up requirements in 2001 we are currently in discussions with bt cellnet
and mmo2 regarding certain terms of the agreement which may result in the
deferral of bt cellnets take or pay commitments there can be no assurances
as to the outcome of these discussions

   third generation technology

   during april 2000 the united kingdom auctioned five licenses relating to
3g mobile communications with the largest amount of spectrum being reserved
for an insurgent carrier vodafone british telecom via bt3g limited one 2
one orange and hutchison 3g uk limited via tiw umts uk ltd acquired 3g
licenses through these auctions

   in anticipation of the deployment of 3g services in the united kingdom
ccuk has prepared models for the rollout and operation of 3g networks in the
united kingdom we contemplate working with the 3g license holders in order to
provide the outsourcing of network operations and management and the site
sharing of network towers equipment and other communications infrastructure
as a solution to many of the commercial and technical challenges and costs
which the 3g license holders will face

   in first quarter 2001 ccuk executed agreements with certain of the 3g
license holders in the uk hutchison 3g uk limited and bt cellnet pursuant
to which such license holders will lease space on certain ccuk sites which are
expected to be used in connection with such companies 3g network rollout see

   there can be no assurances that 3g or other new wireless technologies will
be introduced or deployed as rapidly or in the manner previously or presently
projected by the wireless industry the deployment of 3g has already been
delayed as to prior projections in addition demand and customer adoption
rates of 3g and other technologies may be lower or slower than anticipated for
numerous reasons as a result growth opportunities and demand for site rental
as a result of such technologies may not be realized at the times or to the
extent previously or presently anticipated

   competition

   ntl is ccuks primary competitor in the terrestrial broadcast transmission
market in the united kingdom ntl provides analog transmission services to
itv channels 4 and 5 and s4c digital television networks a number of local
analog commercial radio stations and digital one the national digital radio
license holder ntl retains partial ownership of both the s4c digital
television multiplex and digital one the national independent digital radio
licensee ntl has also been awarded the transmission contract for two of the
six digital terrestrial television multiplexes ccuk has been awarded
transmission contracts for the other four multiplexes

   although ccuk and ntl are broadcast competitors they have reciprocal
rights to the use of each others sites for broadcast transmission usage in
order to enable each of them to achieve the necessary countrywide coverage
this relationship is formalized by the sitesharing agreement entered into in
1991 the time at which ntl was privatized see businessthe companyuk
operationssignificant contractssitesharing agreement

   ntl also offers site rental on approximately 1500 of its sites some of
which are managed on behalf of third parties like ccuk ntl offers a broad
range of siterelated services to its customers including installation and
maintenance

   four uk mobile operators own site infrastructure and lease space to other
users their openness to sharing with direct competitors varies by operator
bt cellnet and vodafone have agreed to cut site costs by jointly developing
and acquiring sites in the scottish highlands british telecom and cable 
wireless communications are both major site sharing customers but also compete
by leasing their own sites to third parties

   ccuk faces competition from a large number of companies in the provision of
network services the companies include ntl specialty consultants and
equipment manufacturers such as nortel and ericsson

regulatory matters

 united states

   federal regulations

   both the fcc and faa regulate towers used for wireless communications
transmitters and receivers such regulations control the siting and marking of
towers and may depending on the characteristics of particular towers require
the registration of tower facilities and the issuance of determinations of no
hazard wireless communications devices operating on towers are separately
regulated and independently licensed based upon the particular frequency used
in addition the fcc and the faa have developed standards to consider
proposals for new or modified tower and antenna structures based upon the
height and location including proximity to airports of proposed tower and
antenna structures proposals to construct or to modify existing tower and
antenna structures above certain heights are reviewed by the faa to ensure the
structure will not present a hazard to aviation which determination may be
conditioned upon compliance with lighting and marking requirements the fcc
requires its licensees to operate communications devices only on towers that
comply with faa rules and are registered with the fcc if required by its
regulations where tower lighting is required by faa regulation tower owners
bear the responsibility of notifying the faa of any tower lighting outage the
company generally indemnifies its customers against any failure to comply with
applicable regulatory standards failure to comply with the applicable
requirements may lead to civil penalties

    zoning restrictions and

    restrictive covenants imposed by community developers

   these regulations vary greatly but typically require us to obtain approval
from local officials or community standards organizations prior to tower
construction local zoning authorities generally have been hostile to
construction of new transmission towers in their communities because of the
height and visibility of the towers

   we hold through certain of our subsidiaries certain licenses for radio
transmission facilities granted by the fcc including licenses for common
carrier microwave and commercial mobile radio services including specialized

     the retail price index over the previous calendar year the current
     price control condition applies until march 31 2006

    a change of control provision which requires notification of
     acquisitions of interest in ccuk of more than 20 by a public
     telecommunications operator or any channel 3 or channel 5 licensee
     which acquisitions entitle the secretary of state to revoke the license

    a site sharing requirement requiring ccuk to provide space on its towers
     to analog and digital broadcast transmission operators and including a
     power for the director general of telecommunications oftel as the
     regulator to determine prices if there is failure between the site
     owner and the prospective site sharer to agree to a price

    a fair trading provision enabling oftel to act against anticompetitive
     behavior by the licensee

    a prohibition on undue preference or discrimination in the provision of
     the services it is required to provide third parties under the

   the uk secretary of state has designated the transmission license a
public telecommunications operator license in order to reserve to himself
certain emergency powers for the protection of national security this
designation is however limited to this objective ccuk does not have a full
uk public telecommunications license and does not require one for its
current activities the department of trade and industry has nevertheless
indicated that it would be willing to issue ccuk such a license as a result
ccuk would gain wider powers to provide services to nonlicense holding third
parties including public switched voice telephony and satellite uplink and
would grant ccuk powers to build out its network over public property so
called code powers

   general telecom license the general telecom license is a general license
to run telecommunications systems and authorizes ccuk to run all the necessary
telecommunications systems to convey messages to its transmitter sites eg
via leased circuits or using its own microwave links the license does not
cover the provision of public switched telephony networks which would require
a public telecommunications license as described above

   satellite license the satellite license is a license to run
telecommunications systems for the provision of satellite telecommunication
services and allows the conveyance via satellite of messages including data
and radio broadcasting the license excludes television broadcasting direct to
the home via satellite although distribution via satellite of television
broadcasting services which are to be transmitted terrestrially is permitted

   licenses under the wireless telegraphy acts 1949 1968 and 1998

   ccuk has a number of licenses under the wireless telegraphy acts 1949 1968

1998 have to be renewed annually with the payment of a significant fee the
bbc virgin radio and talk radio have each contracted to pay their portion of
these fees itvdigital is obligated under the itvdigital digital transmission
contract to pay most of their portion of these fees

telephony services but does not include tower infrastructure accordingly
ccal as a tower owner and operator does not require a carrier license
similarly because ccal does not own any transmitters or spectrum it does not
currently require any apparatus or spectrum licenses issued under the federal
radiocommunications act 1992

                                      20

   carriers have a statutory obligation to provide other carriers with access
to tower facilities and sites and if there is a dispute including as to
pricing the matter may be referred to the australian competition and
consumer commission for resolution as a noncarrier ccal is not currently
subject to this regime and negotiates site access on a commercial basis

   while the federal telecommunications act 1997 grants certain exemptions
from planning laws for the installation of low impact facilities towers are
expressly excluded from the definition of low impact facilities
accordingly in connection with the construction of new tower facilities ccal
is subject to state and local planning laws which vary on a site by site
basis for a limited number of sites ccal is also required to install
aircraft warning lighting in compliance with federal aviation regulations

   local regulations

   in australia there are various local state and territory laws and
regulations which relate to among other things

    town planning and zoning restrictions

    standards applicable to the design and construction of structures and
     facilities

    approval for the construction or alteration of a structure or facility

    the protection of the environment and

    city and other local government ordinances

   as in the united states these laws vary greatly but typically require
tower owners to obtain approval from government bodies prior to tower
construction and for ongoing compliance with environmental laws

environmental matters

   our operations are subject to foreign federal state and local laws and
regulations relating to the management use storage disposal emission and
remediation of and exposure to hazardous and nonhazardous substances
materials and wastes as an owner and operator of real property we are
subject to certain environmental laws that impose strict jointandseveral
liability for the cleanup of onsite or offsite contamination relating to
existing or historical operations and we could also be subject to personal
injury or property damage claims relating to such contamination we are
potentially subject to environmental and cleanup liabilities in the united
states the united kingdom and australia

   as licensees we are also subject to regulations and guidelines that impose
a variety of operational requirements relating to radio frequency emissions
as employers we are subject to osha and similar guidelines regarding employee
protection from rf exposure the potential connection between radio frequency
emissions and certain negative health effects including some forms of cancer
has been the subject of substantial study by the scientific community in
recent years to date the results of these studies have been inconclusive

   we have compliance programs and monitoring projects to help assure that we
are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws
nevertheless there can be no assurance that the costs of compliance with
existing or future environmental laws will not have a material adverse effect
on our business results of operations or financial condition

risk factors

   you should carefully consider the risks described below as well as the
other information contained in this document when evaluating your investment
in our securities

substantial level of indebtednessour substantial level of indebtedness could
adversely affect our ability to react to changes in our business we may also
be limited in our ability to use debt to fund future capital needs

   we have a substantial amount of indebtedness the following chart sets
forth certain important credit information and is presented as of december 31
2001 dollars in thousands

      stockholders equity  2364648
      debt and redeemable preferred stock to equity ratio                 182x


   in addition our earnings for the twelve months ended december 31 2001
were insufficient to cover fixed charges by 3510 million

   as a result of our substantial indebtedness

    we could be more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry
     conditions

    we may find it more difficult to obtain additional financing to fund
     future working capital capital expenditures and other general corporate
     requirements

    we will be required to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow
     from operations to the payment of principal and interest on our debt
     reducing the available cash flow to fund other projects

    we may have limited flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes
     in our business and in the industry and

    we will have a competitive disadvantage relative to other companies in
     our industry with less debt

   we cannot guarantee that we will be able to generate enough cash flow from
operations or that we will be able to obtain enough capital to service our
debt pay our obligations under our convertible preferred stock or fund our
planned capital expenditures in addition we may need to refinance some or
all of our indebtedness on or before maturity we cannot guarantee however
that we will be able to refinance our indebtedness on commercially reasonable
terms or at all

ability to service debtto service our indebtedness we will require a
significant amount of cash from our subsidiaries an inability to access our
subsidiaries cash flow may lead to an acceleration of our indebtedness
including our notes currently the instruments governing our subsidiaries
indebtedness do not allow sufficient funds to be distributed to ccic to
service its indebtedness

   if ccic is unable to refinance its subsidiary debt or renegotiate the terms
of such debt ccic may not be able to meet its debt service requirements
including interest payments on our notes in the future our 9 senior notes
our 9 12 senior notes our 10 34 senior notes and our 9 38 senior notes
require annual cash interest payments of approximately 162 million 119
million 538 million and 422 million respectively prior to november 15
2002 may 15 2004 and august 1 2004 the interest expense on our 10 58
discount notes our 10 38 discount notes and our 11 14 discount notes
respectively will be comprised solely of the amortization of original issue
discount thereafter the 10 58 discount notes the 10 38 discount notes
and the 11 14 discount notes will require annual cash interest payments of
approximately 267 million 519 million and 293 million respectively
prior to december 15 2003 we do not expect to pay cash dividends on our
exchangeable preferred stock or if issued cash interest on the exchange
debentures thereafter assuming all

                                      23

or if issued the exchange debentures will require annual cash dividend or
interest payments of approximately 478 million annual cash interest

addition our various credit facilities will require periodic interest
payments on amounts borrowed thereunder

our business depends on the demand for wireless communications and towerswe
will be adversely affected by any slowdown in the growth of or reduction in
demand for wireless communications

   demand for our site rentals depends on demand for communication sites from
wireless carriers which in turn depends on the demand for wireless
services the demand for our sites depends on many factors which we cannot
control including

    the level of demand for wireless services generally

    the financial condition and access to capital of wireless carriers

    the strategy of carriers relating to owning or leasing communication
     sites

    the availability of equipment to wireless carriers

    changes in telecommunications regulations and

    general economic conditions

   a slowdown in the growth of or reduction in demand in a particular
wireless segment could adversely affect the demand for communication sites
moreover wireless carriers often operate with substantial indebtedness and
financial problems for our customers could result in accounts receivable going
uncollected the loss of a customer and associated lease revenue or a
reduced ability of these customers to finance expansion activities a slowdown
in the deployment of equipment for new wireless technology the consolidation
of wireless carriers or the sharing of networks by wireless carriers could
also adversely affect the demand for our sites finally advances in
technology such as the development of new satellite and antenna systems
could reduce the need for landbased or terrestrial transmission networks
in recent years all of the above factors have occurred to some extent with an
adverse effect on our business and such factors are likely to persist in the
future the occurrence of any of these factors could have a material adverse
effect on our financial condition and results of operations

continuation of the current economic and telecommunications industry
slowdownthis slowdown could materially and adversely affect our business
including reducing demand for our towers and services and the business of
our customers

   the significant general slowdown in the us and certain international
economies particularly in the wireless and telecommunications industries has
negatively affected the factors described in the immediately preceding risk
factor influencing demand for tower space and tower related services this
slowdown could reduce consumer demand for wireless services or negatively
impact the debt and equity markets thereby causing carriers to delay or
abandon implementation of new systems and technologies including 3g and other
wireless broadband services

   we believe that the current economic slowdown particularly in the wireless
and telecommunications industries has already harmed and may continue to
harm the financial condition of some wireless service providers certain of
which including customers of ours have filed or may file for bankruptcy

failure to properly manage our growthif we are unable to successfully
integrate acquired operations or manage our existing operations as we grow
our business will be adversely affected and we may not be able to continue
our current business strategy

   we cannot guarantee that we will be able to successfully integrate acquired
businesses and assets into our business or implement our growth plans without
delay if we fail to do so it could have a material adverse effect

                                      24
page

on our financial condition and results of operations we have grown
significantly over the past three years and such growth continues to be an
important part of our business plan the addition of over 13000 towers and
approximately 30000 tenants to our operations over the past three years has
and will continue to increase our current business considerably and adds
significant operational complexities further we will be integrating the
additional sites relating to the british telecom agreement into our
portfolios see businessthe companyuk operationssignificant
contractsbritish telecom agreement successful integration of these
transactions and assets will depend primarily on our ability to manage these
combined operations our net loss increased to 3662 million for the twelve
months ended december 31 2001 from 2048 million for the twelve months ended
december 31 2000 an increase of 788 as a result of our expanded business
operations and the financing thereof including a 376 increase in
depreciation and amortization and a 233 increase in interest expense as
compared to the twelve months ended december 31 2000 we expect that such net
losses at least in the near term will continue to exceed those of comparable
prioryear periods as a result of our growth and the financing thereof

   implementation of any future acquisitions may impose significant strains on
our management operating systems and financial resources if we fail to
manage our growth or encounter unexpected difficulties during expansion it
could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of
operations the pursuit and integration of certain acquisitions and joint
venture opportunities may require substantial attention from our senior
management which will limit the amount of time they would otherwise be able
to devote to our existing operations

a substantial portion of our revenues is derived from a small number of
customers including the bbc ntl itvdigital and verizonthe loss or
consolidation of any of our limited number of customers could materially
decrease revenues

   approximately 616 or our revenues are derived from 10 customers the loss
of any one of our large customers as a result of bankruptcy merger
consolidation with others customers of ours or otherwise could materially
decrease our revenues and have other adverse effects on our business

   in addition a substantial portion of our revenues are received from a few
major wireless carriers particularly carriers that have transferred their
tower assets to us we cannot guarantee that the lease or management service
agreements with such carriers will not be terminated or that these carriers
will renew such agreements

   if we were to lose our contracts with the bbc or itvdigital or our site
sharing agreement with ntl we would likely lose a substantial portion of our
revenues the bbc accounted for approximately 104 of our revenues for the
twelvemonth period ended december 31 2001 further itvdigital and ntl have
recently been experiencing some financial difficulties and there can be no
assurances that we will not experience adverse effects relating to the
financial difficulties of either such company on march 27 2002 a uk court
approved an application by itvdigital to be placed into administration a
proceeding similar to a chapter 11 bankruptcy proceeding in the united
states designed to protect the applicant from the claims of its creditors
while it reorganizes its business there can be no assurances as to the
outcome of this action or its effect on us our primary concern will be any
modification to our itvdigital transmission contract resulting from these
administration proceedings itvdigital accounted for approximately 307
million or 34 of our revenues for the twelvemonth period ended december
31 2001 the loss of itvdigital as a customer or the modification of the
itvdigital transmission contract could have an adverse effect on our results
of operations

   our broadcast business is substantially dependent on our contracts with the
bbc we cannot guarantee that the bbc will renew our contracts or that they
will not attempt to negotiate terms that are not as favorable to us as those
in place now if we were to lose these bbc contracts our business results of
operations and financial condition would be materially adversely affected the
initial term of our analog transmission contract with the bbc will expire on
march 31 2007 and our digital transmission contract with the bbc expires on
october 31

2010 in addition the bbc can terminate our digital transmission contract
with them after october 31 2003 if the bbcs board of governors does not
believe that digital television in the united kingdom has enough viewers

   a substantial portion of our uk broadcast transmission operations is
conducted using sites owned by ntl our principal broadcast competitor in the
united kingdom ntl also utilizes our sites for their broadcast operations
this site sharing arrangement with ntl may be terminated on december 31 2015
or any 10year anniversary of that date with five years prior notice by
either us or ntl and may be terminated sooner if there is a continuing breach
of the agreement we cannot guarantee that this agreement will not be
terminated which could have a material adverse effect on our business
results of operations and financial condition

as a holding company we require dividends from subsidiaries to meet cash
requirements or pay dividendsif our subsidiaries are unable to dividend cash
to us when we need it we may be unable to pay dividends or satisfy our
obligations including interest and principal payments under our debt
instruments

   crown castle international corp or ccic is a holding company with no
business operations of its own ccics only significant asset is the
outstanding capital stock of its subsidiaries ccic conducts all of its
business operations through its subsidiaries accordingly ccics only source
of cash to pay dividends or make other distributions on its capital stock or
to pay interest and principal on its outstanding indebtedness is distributions
relating to its ownership interest in its subsidiaries from the net earnings
and cash flow generated by such subsidiaries or from proceeds of debt or
equity offerings we currently expect that the earnings and cash flow of
ccics subsidiaries will be retained and used by such subsidiaries in their
operations including the service of their respective debt obligations even
if we did determine to make a distribution in respect of the capital stock of
ccics subsidiaries there can be no assurance that ccics subsidiaries will
generate sufficient cash flow to pay or distribute such a dividend or funds
or that applicable state law and contractual restrictions including negative
covenants contained in the debt instruments of such subsidiaries would permit
such dividends distributions or payments furthermore the terms of our
credit facilities place restrictions on our principal subsidiaries ability to
pay dividends or to make distributions and in any event such dividends or
distributions may only be paid if no default has occurred under the applicable
instrument moreover ccics subsidiaries are permitted under the terms of
their existing debt instruments to incur additional indebtedness that may
restrict or prohibit the making of distributions the payment of dividends or
the making of loans by such subsidiaries to ccic see businessrisk
factorssubstantial level of indebtedness and businessrisk factors
ability to service debt

restrictive debt covenantsthe terms of our debt instruments limit our
ability to take a number of actions that our management might otherwise
believe to be in our best interests in addition if we fail to comply with
our covenants our debt could be accelerated

   currently we have debt instruments in place that restrict our ability to
incur more indebtedness pay dividends create liens sell assets and engage
in certain mergers and acquisitions our subsidiaries under their debt
instruments are also required to maintain specific financial ratios our
ability to comply with the restrictions of these instruments and to satisfy
our debt obligations will depend on our future operating performance if we
fail to comply with the debt restrictions we will be in default under those
instruments which in some cases would cause the maturity of substantially all
of our longterm indebtedness to be accelerated

we operate our business in an increasingly competitive industry and some of
our competitors have significantly more resourcesas a result of this
competition we may find it more difficult to achieve favorable lease rates on
our towers

   we face competition for site rental customers from various sources
including

    other large independent tower owners

    wireless carriers that own and operate their own towers and lease
     antenna space to other carriers

    site development companies that acquire antenna space on existing towers
     for wireless carriers and manage new tower construction

                                      26
page

    traditional local independent tower operators and

    alternative facilities such as billboards weather balloons utility
     poles and rooftops

   wireless carriers that own and operate their own tower portfolios generally
are substantially larger and have greater financial resources than we have
further the weak financial status of certain of our competitors could lead to
increased competition in certain areas competition for tenants on towers
could adversely affect lease rates and service income

new technologies could make our tower antenna leasing services less desirable
to potential tenants and result in decreasing revenuessuch new technologies
could decrease demand for tower leases and negatively impact our revenues

   the development and implementation of signal combining technologies dual
band technologies which permit one antenna to service two different
transmission frequencies and thereby two customers may reduce the need for
towerbased broadcast transmission and hence demand for our antenna space

   mobile satellite systems and other new technologies could compete with
landbased wireless communications systems thereby reducing the demand for
tower lease space and other services we provide the fcc has granted license
applications for several lowearth orbiting satellite systems that are
intended to provide mobile voice or data services the growth in delivery of
video services by direct broadcast satellites could also adversely affect
demand for our antenna space

   other technologies which may be developed and emerge could serve as
substitutes and alternatives to leasing which might otherwise be anticipated
or expected on our sites and towers had such technologies not existed any
reduction in tower leasing demand resulting from dual band satellite or other
technologies could negatively impact our revenues or otherwise have a material
adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations

agreements among our customers may act as alternatives to leasing sites from
usthe proliferation of such agreements could have a material adverse effect
on our revenues and operations

   wireless service providers frequently enter into agreements with
competitors allowing them to utilize one anothers wireless communications
facilities to accommodate customers who are out of range of their home
providers services in addition wireless service providers have also entered
into agreements allowing two or more carriers to share a single wireless
network such agreements may be viewed by wireless service providers as a
superior alternative to leasing space for their own antennas on our
communication sites the proliferation of these roaming and network sharing
agreements could have a material adverse effect on our business financial
condition or results of operations

we may not be able to construct or acquire new towers at the pace and in the
locations that we desireif we are unable to do so we may not be able to
satisfy our current agreements to build new towers and we may have difficulty
finding tenants to lease space on our new towers

   our growth strategy depends in part on our ability to construct and operate
towers in conjunction with expansion by wireless carriers if we are unable to
build new towers when wireless carriers require them or we are unable to
build new towers where we believe the best opportunity to add tenants exists
we could fail to meet certain contractual obligations or we could lose
opportunities to lease space on our towers

   our ability to construct these new towers could be affected by a number of
factors beyond our control including

    zoning and local permitting requirements and national regulatory
     approvals

    availability of construction equipment and skilled construction
     personnel and

    bad weather conditions

                                      27
page

   in addition as the concern over tower proliferation has grown in recent
years certain communities have placed restrictions on new tower construction
or have delayed granting permits required for construction you should
consider that

    the barriers to new construction may prevent us from building towers
     where we want

    we may not be able to complete the number of towers planned for
     construction in accordance with the requirements of our customers and

    we cannot guarantee that there will be a significant need for the
     construction of new towers once the wireless carriers complete their
     tower networks

   all of the above factors could affect both our domestic and international
operations in addition competition laws could prevent us from acquiring or
constructing towers or tower networks in certain geographical areas

variability in demand for network services may reduce the predictability of
our resultsour network services business has historically experienced
significant volatility in demand as a result the operating results of our
network services business for any particular period may vary significantly and
should not be considered as necessarily being indicative of longerterm
results

   demand for our network services fluctuates from period to period and within
periods these fluctuations are caused by a number of factors including

    the timing of customers capital expenditures

    annual budgetary considerations of customers

    the rate and volume of wireless carriers tower buildouts

    the availability of equipment to wireless carriers

    timing of existing customer contracts and

    general economic conditions

   while demand for our network services fluctuates we must incur certain
costs such as maintaining a staff of network services employees in
anticipation of future contracts even when there may be no current business
furthermore as wireless carriers complete their buildouts the need for the
construction of new towers and the demand for our network services could
decrease significantly and could result in fluctuations and possibly
significant declines in our operating performance

we anticipate significant capital expenditures and may need additional
financing which may not be availableif we are unable to raise capital in the
future when needed we may not be able to fund our operations and future
growth

   over time we will continue to require significant capital expenditures for
the construction and strategic acquisition of sites we have agreed to lease
space on and develop as many as 4000 british telecom exchange sites
throughout the united kingdom we expect to invest an aggregate of
approximately 325 million developing the british telecom site portfolio see
businessthe companyuk operationssignificant contractsbritish
telecom agreement under our buildtosuit agreements with certain wireless
carriers we are required to construct certain towers and incur capital
expenditures our partners in our two joint ventures with verizon
communications will have the right after january 31 2003 in the case of the
gte jv and after march 31 2002 in the case of the bell atlantic jv to
dissolve those joint ventures and require us to purchase for cash in the
case of the gte jv and for cash or common stock at our option in the case
of the bell atlantic jv their interests in the joint ventures such action
may negatively impact our liquidity or cause dilution of our common stock see
businessthe companyus operations in addition some of the other
opportunities that we are currently investigating could require significant
additional capital

                                      28

   we had cash cash equivalents and marketable securities of 1006 million
at december 31 2001 we also had approximately 1172 million in outstanding
borrowings under our credit facilities at that date the remaining borrowing
availability of approximately 589 million under the credit facilities was
undrawn our ability to borrow under the credit facilities is limited by the
financial covenants contained in those agreements including covenants
regarding the ratio of total debt to ebitda and interest and fixed charge
coverage ratios relating to us and our subsidiaries under the terms of the
credit facilities we could draw the available 589 million in additional
borrowings as of december 31 2001 while remaining in compliance with these
covenants

   we may need additional sources of debt or equity capital in the future
additional financing may not be available or may be restricted by the terms of
our credit facilities and the terms of our other outstanding indebtedness
additional sales of equity securities will dilute our existing stockholders
if we are unable to raise capital when our needs arise we may not be able to
fund our operations and future growth

we generally lease or sublease the land under our towers and may not be able
to maintain these leasesif we fail to protect our rights against persons
claiming superior rights in our sites our business may be adversely affected

   our real property interests relating to our sites consist primarily of fee
interests leasehold and subleasehold interests easements licenses and
rightsofway a loss of these interests including losses arising from the
bankruptcy of one or more of our lessors or from the default by one or more of
our lessors under their mortgage financing could interfere with our ability
to conduct our business and generate revenues for various reasons we may not
always have the ability to access analyze and verify all information
regarding titles and other issues prior to completing an acquisition of sites
further we may not be able to renew ground leases on commercially viable
terms our inability to protect our rights to the land under our towers could
have a material adverse affect on our business financial condition and
results of operations

extensive regulations which could change at any time and with which we could
fail to comply regulate our businessif we fail to comply with applicable
regulations we could be fined or even lose our right to conduct some of our
business

   a variety of foreign federal state and local regulations apply to our
business failure to comply with applicable requirements may lead to civil
penalties or require us to assume costly indemnification obligations or breach
contractual provisions we cannot guarantee that existing regulatory policies
will not adversely affect the timing or cost of new tower construction or that
additional regulations will not be adopted which increase delays or result in
additional costs these factors could have a material adverse effect on our
financial condition and results of operations

   since we signed our analog transmission contract with the bbc the bbc has
increased its service requirements to include 24hour broadcasting on our
transmission network for the bbcs two national television services and a
requirement for us to add a number of additional analog stations and service
enhancements to existing analog stations the bbc has agreed to pay additional
charges to us for these service enhancements these additional charges
required a revision amendment to that part of ccuks transmission
telecommunications license dealing with price regulation of analog
broadcasting services to the bbc the bbc and oftel the relevant regulatory
authority in the united kingdom have agreed to modify the license regulatory
provisions to take into account these agreed additional payments

emissions from our antennas may create health riskswe could suffer from
future claims if the radio frequency emissions from equipment on our towers is
demonstrated to cause negative health effects

   the fcc and other government agencies impose requirements and other
guidelines on its licensees relating to radio frequency emissions the
potential connection between radio frequency emissions and certain negative
health effects including some forms of cancer has been the subject of
substantial study by the scientific community in recent years to date the
results of these studies have been inconclusive we cannot guarantee that
claims relating to radio frequency emissions will not arise in the future

                                      29
page

   public perception of possible health risks associated with cellular and
other wireless communications could slow the growth of wireless companies
which could in turn slow our growth in particular negative public perception
of and regulations regarding these perceived health risks could slow the
market acceptance of wireless communications services

   our exposure to the potential risk of harm due to radio frequency emissions
may increase as the number of rooftop sites in our portfolios including the
sites we acquire on rooftops of british telecom exchange sites pursuant to our

operationssignificant contractsbritish telecom agreement rooftop sites
may tend to be more accessible to a wider range of personnel including
personnel with little or no knowledge of wireless communications equipment
than tower sites increasing the number of persons who may be potentially
exposed to emissions emanating from equipment located on such rooftops

   if a connection between radio emissions and possible negative health
effects were established our operations costs and revenues would be
materially and adversely affected we do not maintain any significant
insurance with respect to these matters

our international operations expose us to changes in foreign currency exchange
ratesif we fail to properly match or hedge the currencies in which we
conduct business we could suffer losses as a result of changes in currency
exchange rates

   we conduct business in countries outside the united states which exposes
us to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates for the twelve months
ended december 31 2001 approximately 287 of our consolidated revenues
originated outside the united states all of which were denominated in
currencies other than us dollars principally british pounds sterling and
australian dollars we have not historically engaged in significant hedging
activities relating to our nonus dollar operations and we could suffer
future losses as a result of changes in currency exchange rates

we are heavily dependent on our senior managementif we lose members of our
senior management we may not be able to find appropriate replacements on a
timely basis and our business could be adversely affected

   our existing operations and continued future development depend to a
significant extent upon the performance and active participation of certain
key individuals as employees including our chief executive officer we cannot
guarantee that we will be successful in retaining the services of these or
other key personnel most of our executives including our chief executive
officer have not signed noncompetition agreements if we were to lose any of
these individuals we may not be able to find appropriate replacements on a
timely basis and our financial condition and results of operations could be
materially adversely affected

antitakeover provisions in our certificate of incorporation could have
effects that conflict with the interests of our stockholderscertain
provisions of our certificate of incorporation bylaws and operative
agreements could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control
of us even if such a change in control would be beneficial to you

   we have a number of antitakeover devices in place that will hinder
takeover attempts and could reduce the market value of our common stock our
antitakeover provisions include

    a staggered board of directors

    a shareholder rights agreement

    the authority of the board of directors to issue preferred stock without
     approval of the holders of common stock and

    advance notice requirements for director nominations and actions to be
     taken at annual meetings

                                      30

   in addition our bylaws permit special meetings of the stockholders to be
called only upon the request of a majority of the board of directors and deny
stockholders the ability to call such meetings further our bbc contracts may
be terminated upon the occurrence of certain change of control events
described in such contracts such provisions as well as the provisions of
section 203 of the delaware general corporation law could impede a merger
consolidation takeover or other business combination or discourage a
potential acquiror from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to
obtain control of us

shares eligible for future salesales of a substantial number of shares of
common stock could adversely affect the market price of the common stock

   future sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock could
adversely affect the market price of our common stock as of march 15 2002
we had 219842529 shares of common stock outstanding in addition we have
reserved 32435557 shares of common stock for issuance under our various
stock option plans 1639990 shares of common stock upon exercise of
outstanding warrants and 18357114 shares of common stock for the conversion
of our outstanding convertible preferred stock

   a small number of shareholders owns a significant percentage of our
outstanding common stock if any one of these shareholders or any group of
our shareholders sells a large quantity of shares of our common stock or the
public market perceives that existing shareholders might sell shares of common
stock the market price of our common stock could significantly decline

   pursuant to a disposition agreement which we entered into with france
telecom on july 5 2000 france telecom sold its remaining interest in us
approximately 177 million shares of common stock to salomon brothers
international limited or sbil which agreed to hold such shares for a lock
up period which expired on june 8 2001 after such date sbil is entitled to
sell these shares and after june 8 2002 we will have the right to require
sbil to sell any such remaining shares the sale of all or a portion of these
shares held by sbil could adversely affect the market price of our common
stock

   the holders of our 8 14 convertible preferred stock and our 625
convertible preferred stock are entitled to receive cumulative dividends at
the rate of 8 14 per annum and 625 per annum respectively payable on a
quarterly basis we have the option to pay the dividends on such series of
preferred stock in cash or in shares of our common stock we have historically
paid such dividends with shares of our common stock and we expect to continue
to do so the number of shares of our common stock required to be issued to
pay such dividends is dependent upon the current market value of our common
stock at the time such dividend is required to be paid for the years ended
december 31 2000 and 2001 dividends on our 8 14 convertible preferred
stock were paid with 579000 and 1400000 shares of common stock
respectively and dividends on our 625 convertible preferred stock were paid
with 281968 and 1781764 shares of common stock respectively the shares of
common stock issued to pay such dividends will continue to have a dilutive
effect upon the shares of our common stock otherwise outstanding and further
declines in the fair market value of our common stock will increase the
effective dilution

disputes with customers and suppliers have recently increasedsuch disputes
could lead to increased tensions damaged relationships or litigation which
could result in the loss of a key customer or supplier

   we have recently experienced a rise in the number of conflicts or disputes
between ourselves and some of our customers and service providers most of
these disputes relate to the interpretation of terms in our contracts while
we seek to resolve such conflicts amicably and have generally resolved
customer and supplier disputes on commercially reasonable terms such disputes
could lead to increased tensions and damaged relationships between ourselves
and these entities some of whom are key customers or suppliers of ours in
addition if we are unable to resolve these differences amicably we may be
forced to litigate these disputes in order to enforce or defend our rights
there can be no assurances as to the outcome of these disputes damaged
relationships or litigation with our key customers or suppliers could lead to
decreased revenues including as a result of losing a customer or increased
costs which would have a material adverse effect on our business operations
or financial condition

   in the united states our interests in our tower sites are comprised of a
variety of ownership interests leases created by longterm lease agreements
private easements and easements licenses or rightsofway granted by
government entities in rural areas a tower site typically consists of a
three to fiveacre tract which supports towers equipment shelters and guy
wires to stabilize the structure less than 3000 square feet are required for
a selfsupporting tower structure of the kind typically used in metropolitan
areas our land leases generally have five or tenyear terms and frequently
contain one or more renewal options some land leases provide tradeout
arrangements whereby we allow the landlord to use tower space in lieu of
paying all or part of the land rent as of december 31 2001 we had
approximately 8500 land leases in the united states under the 2000 credit
facility our senior lenders have liens on a substantial number of our land
leases and other property interests in the united states

   in the united kingdom tower sites range from less than 400 square feet for
a small rural tv booster station to over 50 acres for a highpower radio
station as in the united states the site accommodates the towers equipment
buildings or shelters and where necessary guy wires to support the
structure land is either owned freehold which is usual for the larger sites
or is held on longterm leases that generally have terms of 21 years or more

our expectations regarding the future performance of our businesses and the
other nonhistorical statements in this discussion are forwardlooking
statements see cautionary statement for purposes of forwardlooking
statements this discussion should be read in conjunction with selected
financial data and the consolidated financial statements and related notes
included elsewhere in this document results of operations of the acquired
businesses and towers that are wholly and majority owned are included in our
consolidated financial statements for the periods subsequent to the respective
dates of acquisition as such our results of operations for the year ended
december 31 2001 are not comparable to the year ended december 31 2000 and
the results for the year ended december 31 2000 are not comparable to the
year ended december 31 1999

overview

   the continued growth of our business depends substantially on the condition
of the wireless communications and broadcast industries we believe that the
demand for communications sites will continue to

                                      36
page

grow and expect that due to increased competition wireless carriers will
continue to seek operating and capital efficiencies by 1 outsourcing certain
network services and the buildout and operation of new and existing
infrastructure and 2 planning to use a tower site as a common location or
colocating for the placement of their antennas and transmission equipment
alongside the equipment of other communications providers in addition we
believe that more wireless carriers will seek to sell their wireless
communications infrastructure to or establish joint ventures with
experienced infrastructure providers such as the company that have the
demonstrated ability to manage the assets

   further we believe that wireless carriers and broadcasters will continue
to seek to outsource the operation of their towers and may eventually
outsource their transmission networks including the transmission of their
signals management believes that our ability to manage towers and
transmission networks and our proven track record of providing services
addressing all aspects of signaling systems from the originating station to
the terminating receiver or endtoend services to the wireless
communications and broadcasting industries position our company to capture
such business

   the willingness of wireless carriers to utilize our infrastructure and
related services is affected by numerous factors including

   consumer demand for wireless services

   interest rates

   cost of capital

   availability of capital to wireless carriers

   tax policies

   willingness to colocate equipment

   local restrictions on the proliferation of towers

   cost of building towers

   technological changes affecting the number of communications sites needed
    to provide wireless communications services to a given geographic area
    and

   our ability to efficiently satisfy their service requirements

our revenues that are derived from the provision of transmission services to
the broadcasting industry will be affected by among other things

   the timing of the rollout of digital television broadcasts from tower
    mounted antenna systems or digital terrestrial television broadcasts
    principally in the united kingdom

   consumer demand for digital terrestrial broadcasting

   interest rates

   cost of capital

   zoning restrictions on towers and

   the cost of building towers

   as an important part of our business strategy we will seek to

  1 maximize utilization of our tower capacity

  2 utilize the expertise of us uk and australian personnel to capture
    global growth opportunities

  3 partner with wireless carriers to assume ownership of their existing
    towers and

  4 build new towers for wireless carriers

critical accounting policies

   the following is a discussion of the accounting policies that we believe
1 are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results
of operations and 2 require our most difficult subjective or complex
judgments often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of
matters that are inherently uncertain

   revenue recognition

   site rental and broadcast transmission revenues are recognized on a monthly
basis over the term of the relevant lease agreement or contract these
revenues are recognized on a straightline basis regardless of whether the
payments from the customer are received in equal monthly amounts some
agreements provide for rentfree periods at the beginning of the lease term
while others call for rent to be prepaid for some period if the payment terms
call for fixed escalations as in fixed dollar or fixed percentage increases
the effect of such increases is spread evenly over the term of the agreement
as a result of this accounting method a portion of the revenue recognized in
a given period represents cash collected in other periods for 2001 the non
cash portion of our site rental and broadcast transmission revenues amounted
to approximately 236 million

   network services revenues are generally recognized under 1 the completed
contract method or 2 the percentageofcompletion method under the
completed contract method revenues and costs for a particular project are
recognized in total at the completion date under the percentageofcompletion
method costs are recognized as incurred and revenues are recognized based on
the proportion of contract costs incurred compared to the estimated total
contract costs the completed contract method is used for projects that
require relatively short periods of time to complete primarily antenna
installations which generally require three months or less the percentage
ofcompletion method is used for projects that require longer periods to
complete

   when using the completed contract method of accounting for network services
revenues we must accurately determine the completion date for the project in
order to record the revenues and costs in the proper period for antenna
installations we consider the project complete when the customer can begin
transmitting its signal through the antenna when using the percentageof
completion method we must be able to accurately estimate the total costs we
expect to incur on a project in order to record the proper amount of revenues
for the period under both methods we must be able to estimate losses on
uncompleted contracts as such losses must be recognized as soon as they are
known we do not believe that our use of the completed contract method for
shortterm projects produces operating results that differ substantially from
the percentageofcompletion method

   allowance for doubtful accounts receivable

   as part of our normal accounting procedures we must evaluate our
outstanding accounts receivable to estimate whether they will be collected
this is a subjective process that involves making judgments about our
customers ability and willingness to pay these accounts an allowance for
doubtful accounts is recorded as an offset to accounts receivable in order to
present a net balance that we believe will be collected in estimating the
appropriate balance for this allowance we consider 1 specific reserves for
accounts we believe may prove to be uncollectible and 2 additional reserves
based on historical collections for the remainder of our accounts additions
to the allowance for doubtful accounts are charged to operating expenses and
deductions from the allowance are recorded when specific accounts receivable
are written off as uncollectible if our estimate of uncollectible accounts
should prove to be inaccurate at some future date the results of operations
for the period could be materially effected by any necessary correction to the
allowance for doubtful accounts

   valuation of longlived assets

   we review the carrying values of property and equipment and other long
lived assets including goodwill for impairment whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be

                                      38
page

recoverable if the sum of the estimated future cash flows undiscounted from
the asset is less than its carrying amount an impairment loss is recognized
measurement of an impairment loss is based on the fair value of the asset our
determination that an adverse event or change in circumstance has occurred
will generally involve 1 a deterioration in an assets financial performance
compared to historical results 2 a shortfall in an assets financial
performance compared to forecasted results or 3 a change in strategy
affecting the utility of the asset our measurement of the fair value of an
impaired asset will generally be based on an estimate of discounted future
cash flows

   on january 1 2002 we will adopt the new accounting standard for goodwill
and intangible assets see impact of recently issued accounting
standards in accordance with that new standard we will review goodwill for
impairment on an annual basis regardless of whether adverse events or changes
in circumstances have occurred

   deferred income taxes

   we record deferred income tax assets and liabilities on our balance sheet
related to events that impact our financial statements and tax returns in
different periods in order to compute these deferred tax balances we first
analyze the differences between the book basis and tax basis of our assets and
liabilities referred to as temporary differences these temporary
differences are then multiplied by current tax rates to arrive at the balances
for the deferred income tax assets and liabilities if deferred tax assets
exceed deferred tax liabilities we must estimate whether those net deferred
asset amounts will be realized in the future a valuation allowance is then
provided for the net deferred asset amounts that are not likely to be
realized

   the change in our net deferred income tax balances during a period results
in a deferred income tax provision or benefit in our statement of operations
if our expectations about the future tax consequences of past events should
prove to be inaccurate the balances of our deferred income tax assets and
liabilities could require significant adjustments in future periods such
adjustments could cause a material effect on our results of operations for the
period of the adjustment

results of operations

   our primary sources of revenues are from

  1 renting antenna space on towers and rooftops sites

  2 providing analog and digital broadcast transmission services and

  3 providing network services including the installation of antennas on
      our sites as well as third party sites

   site rental revenues in the us are received primarily from wireless
communications companies including those operating in the following
categories of wireless communications

   cellular

   personal communications services a digital service operating at a higher
    frequency range than cellular

   microwave

   paging

   specialized mobile radio a service operating in the frequency range used
    for twoway radio communication by public safety trucking companies and
    other dispatch service users and

   enhanced specialized mobile radio a service operating in the smr
    frequency range using enhanced technology

                                      39
page

site rental revenues are generally recognized on a monthly basis under lease
agreements which typically have original terms of five years with three or
four optional renewal periods of five years each

   broadcast transmission services revenues in the uk are received for both
analog and digital transmission services monthly analog transmission revenues
are principally received from the bbc under a contract with an initial 10year
term through march 31 2007 digital transmission services revenues from the
bbc and itvdigital formerly ondigital are recognized under contracts with
initial terms of 12 years through november 15 2010 monthly revenues from
these digital transmission contracts increase over time as the network rollout
progresses on march 27 2002 a uk court approved an application by
itvdigital to be placed into administration a proceeding similar to a
chapter 11 bankruptcy proceeding in the united states designed to protect the
applicant from the claims of its creditors while it reorganizes its business
there can be no assurances as to the outcome of this action or its effect on
us itvdigital accounted for approximately 307 million or 34 of our
revenues for the twelvemonth period ended december 31 2001 the loss of
itvdigital as a customer or the modification of the itvdigital transmission
contract could have an adverse effect on our results of operations see item
1 businessuk operationssignificant contracts

   site rental revenues in the uk are received from other broadcast
transmission service providers primarily ntl and wireless communications
companies including all four uk cellular operators bt cellnet vodafone
one 2 one and orange site rental revenues are generally recognized on a
monthly basis under lease agreements with original terms of three to 12 years
such lease agreements generally require annual payments in advance and
include rental rate adjustment provisions between one and three years from the
commencement of the lease site rental revenues are expected to become an
increasing portion of ccuks total uk revenue base and we believe that the
demand for site rental from communication service providers will increase in
line with the expected growth of these communication services in the united
kingdom

   network services revenues in the us consist of revenues from

  1 antenna installation

  2 site acquisition

  3 site development and construction

  4 network design and site selection and

  5 other services

network services revenues are received primarily from wireless communications
companies network services revenues in the us are recognized under service
contracts which provide for billings on either a fixed price basis or a time
and materials basis demand for our network services fluctuates from period to
period and within periods see item 1 businessrisk factorsvariability in
demand for network services may reduce the predictability of our results
consequently the operating results of our network services businesses for any
particular period may vary significantly and should not be considered as
indicative of longerterm results we also derive revenues from the ownership
and operation of microwave radio and specialized mobile radio networks in
puerto rico where we own radio wave spectrum in the 2000 mhz and 6000 mhz
range for microwave radio and the 800 mhz range for specialized mobile
radio these revenues are generally recognized under monthly management or
service agreements

   network services revenues in the uk consist of 1 network design and
site selection site acquisition site development and antenna installation
and 2 site management and other services network design and development and
related services are provided to

  1 a number of broadcasting and related organizations both in the united
      kingdom and other countries

  2 all four uk cellular operators and

  3 hutchison as part of their deployment of 3g sevices in the uk

these services are often subject to a competitive bid and a significant
proportion result from an operator coming onto an existing ccuk site revenues
from such services are recognized on either a fixed price or a time and
materials basis site management and other services consisting of both
network monitoring and equipment maintenance are carried out in the united
kingdom for a number of emergency service organizations ccuk receives
revenues for such services under contracts with original terms of between
three and five years such contracts provide fixed prices for network
monitoring and variable pricing dependent on the level of equipment
maintenance carried out in a given period

   costs of operations for site rental in the us primarily consist of

   land leases

   repairs and maintenance

   employee compensation and related benefits costs

   utilities

   insurance

   property taxes

   monitoring costs and

   in the case of our few managed sites rental payments

for any given tower such costs are relatively fixed over a monthly or an
annual time period as such operating costs for owned towers do not generally
increase significantly as additional customers are added however rental
expenses at certain managed sites increase as additional customer antennas are
added resulting in higher incremental revenues but lower incremental margins
than on owned towers

   costs of operations for broadcast transmission services in the uk consist
primarily of employee compensation and related benefits costs utilities
rental payments under the sitesharing agreement with ntl circuit costs and
repairs and maintenance on both transmission equipment and structures site
rental operating costs in the uk consist primarily of employee compensation
and related benefits costs utilities and repairs maintenance and leases of
land or rooftop sites with the exception of land and rooftop leases the
majority of such costs are relatively fixed in nature with increases in
revenue from new installations on existing sites generally being achieved
without a corresponding increase in costs generally leases of land and
rooftop sites have a revenue sharing component that averages 20 to 30 of
additional revenues added from subsequent tenants

   costs of operations for network services consist primarily of employee
compensation and related benefits costs subcontractor services consulting
fees and other onsite construction and materials costs we incur these
network services costs 1 to support our internal operations including
maintenance of our owned towers and 2 to maintain the employees necessary
to provide endtoend services to third parties regardless of the level of
such business at any time we believe that our experienced staff enables us to
provide the type of endtoend services that enhance our ability to attract
wireless service providers to our sites

   general and administrative expenses consist primarily of

   employee compensation training recruitment and related benefits costs

   advertising

   professional and consulting fees

   office rent and related expenses and

   travel costs

                                      41

   corporate development expenses represent costs incurred in connection with
acquisitions and development of new business initiatives these expenses
consist primarily of

   allocated compensation and external professional fees

the increases in site rental and broadcast transmission revenues reflect the
new tenant additions on our tower sites the increases in network services and
other revenues reflect continued demand for antenna installation from our
tenants along with increased third party service work

   costs of operations for 2001 were 4672 million an increase of 1526
million from 2000 this increase was primarily attributable to

from 436 for 2000 because of higher margins attributable to incremental
revenues from the crown atlantic ccal and ccusa operations costs of
operations for network services and other as a percentage of network services
and other revenues increased to 707 for 2001 from 592 for 2000 because of
lower margins from the ccusa ccuk and crown atlantic operations network
services revenues for 2001 included a greater proportion of third party
service work than in 2000 and third party services typically produce lower
margins than tenant antenna installation services

   general and administrative expenses for 2001 were 1025 million an

the increases in general and administrative expenses resulted primarily from
higher staffing levels to support the growth of our business general and
administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues decreased for 2001 to
114 from 118 for 2000 because of lower overhead costs as a percentage of
revenues for ccusa ccal and crown atlantic

connection with a restructuring of our business announced in july 2001 such
charges related to employee severance payments and costs of office closures
in addition we announced in march 2002 that we plan to record a nonrecurring
restructuring charge estimated to be between approximately 70 million and
130 million with respect to staff redundancies and the disposition of
certain service lines in connection with our uk operations we expect the
charge to be reflected in our results of operations for 2002 see 
restructuring charges and asset writedown charges

   for 2001 we recorded asset writedown charges of 249 million in
connection with the restructuring of our business announced in july 2001 such

down of such abandoned projects the total amount of construction in process
being reviewed is approximately 38 million see restructuring charges and
asset writedown charges

   for 2001 we recorded noncash general and administrative compensation
charges of 61 million related to the issuance of stock and stock options to
certain employees and executives compared to 31 million for 2000 see 
compensation charges related to stock option grants and acquisitions

   depreciation and amortization for 2001 was 3285 million an increase of

      the property and equipment goodwill and other intangible assets
      related to the ccusa operations

  1 the investment of the net proceeds from our recent offerings see 
      liquidity and capital resources offset by

  2 costs incurred in connection with unsuccessful acquisition attempts and

  3 our share of losses incurred by unconsolidated affiliates

   interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs for 2001 was
2974 million an increase of 562 million or 233 from 2000 this

and crown atlantic and interest on the 10 34 senior notes and the 9 38
senior notessee liquidity and capital resources

   the provision for income taxes of 165 million for 2001 consists primarily
of a noncash deferred tax liability recognized by ccuk ccuks deferred tax
liability resulted from an excess of basis differences for its property and
equipment over its available tax net operating losses

liquidity and capital resources

   our business strategy contemplates substantial capital expenditures in
connection with the expansion of our tower portfolios by pursuing buildto
suit opportunities in the markets in which we currently operate

   since its inception ccic has generally funded its activities other than
acquisitions and investments through excess proceeds from contributions of
equity capital and cash provided by operations ccic has financed acquisitions
and investments with the proceeds from equity contributions borrowings under
our senior credit facilities and issuances of debt securities since its
inception ccuk has generally funded its activities other than the
acquisition of the bbc home service transmission business through cash
provided by operations and borrowings under ccuks credit facility ccuk
financed the acquisition of the bbc home service transmission business with
the proceeds from equity contributions and the issuance of the ccuk bonds

   for the years ended december 31 1999 2000 and 2001 our net cash provided
by operating activities was 926 million 1655 million and 1319 million
respectively for the years ended december 31 1999 2000 and 2001 our net
cash provided by financing activities was 16704 million 17071 million
and 11093 million respectively our primary financingrelated activities
in 2001 included the following

   january 2001 offering

   in january 2001 we sold 13445200 shares of our common stock in an
underwritten public offering the shares were sold to the public at a price of
2625 per share and we received proceeds of 3429 million after
underwriting discounts of 101 million the proceeds from this offering will
be used for general corporate purposes

   crown atlantic credit facility

   in march 2001 the crown atlantic credit facility was amended to increase
the available borrowings to 3450 million under the amended facility the
amount of available borrowings will begin to decrease on march 31 2003

   may 2001 debt offering

   on may 10 2001 we issued 4500 million aggregate principal amount of our
9 38 senior notes for proceeds of 4410 million after underwriting
discounts of 90 million the proceeds from the sale of these securities
will be used to fund the initial interest payments on the 9 38 senior notes
and for general corporate purposes

   capital expenditures were 6831 million for the year ended december 31
2001 of which 38 million were for ccic 3638 million were for ccusa
942 million were for crown atlantic 2190 million were for ccuk and 23
million were for ccal we anticipate that we will build through the end of
2002 approximately 450 to 550 towers in the united states at a cost of
approximately 135 million and approximately 450 to 550 towers in the united
kingdom at a cost of approximately 50 million in addition we are obligated
to pay a site access fee to british telecom in the amount of pounds1000
million 1454 million we are currently in discussions regarding the
deferral of a portion of this payment but there can be no assurance as to the
outcome of these discussions we also expect to spend approximately 125
million in the united states for tower improvements including enhancements to
the structural capacity of our domestic towers in order to support the
anticipated leasing

   in april 2001 we entered into a share purchase agreement for the
acquisition of 49 of the outstanding capital stock of raiway spa
raiway raiway is a subsidiary of rai radio televisione italiana spa
rai the italian stateowned television and radio broadcaster raiway
manages over 2300 broadcast transmission sites across italy the cost of our
investment in raiway amounted to approximately 3838 million in cash and
such amount was deposited into a eurodenominated escrow account upon
execution of the share purchase agreement the transaction was subject to
approval by the italian regulatory authorities and in october 2001 we were
notified that the italian minister of communication had declined to approve
the transaction pursuant to the terms of the agreement the escrow deposit
was returned to us in november 2001

   we expect that the execution of our new tower build or buildtosuit
program will have a material impact on our liquidity we expect that once
integrated these new towers will have a positive impact on liquidity but
will require some period of time to offset the initial adverse impact on
liquidity in addition we believe that as new towers become operational and
we begin to add tenants they should result in a longterm increase in
liquidity

   to fund the execution of our business strategy including the construction
of new towers we expect to use the net proceeds of our recent offerings and
cash provided by operations we do not currently expect to utilize further
borrowings available under our us and uk credit facilities in any
significant amounts we will have additional cash needs to fund our operations
in the future we may also have additional cash needs in the future if
additional tower acquisitions or buildtosuit opportunities arise if we do
not otherwise have cash available or borrowings under our credit facilities
have otherwise been utilized when our cash need arises we would be forced to
seek additional debt or equity financing or to forego the opportunity in the
event we determine to seek additional debt or equity financing there can be
no assurance that any such financing will be available on commercially
acceptable terms or at all or permitted by the terms of our existing
indebtedness

   as of december 31 2001 we had consolidated cash and cash equivalents of
8046 million including 59 million at ccusa 1690 million at ccuk 131
million at crown atlantic 150 million at ccal 3895 million in an
unrestricted investment subsidiary and 2121 million at ccic and a restricted

unused borrowing availability under its credit facility of approximately
pounds300 million 436 million as of march 15 2002 our restricted
us and australian subsidiaries had approximately 5000 million of unused
borrowing availability under the 2000 credit facility our various credit
facilities require our subsidiaries to maintain certain financial covenants
and place restrictions on the ability of our subsidiaries to among other
things incur debt and liens pay dividends make capital expenditures
undertake transactions with affiliates and make investments these facilities
also limit the ability of the borrowing subsidiaries to pay dividends to ccic

   the primary factors that determine our subsidiaries ability to comply with
their debt covenants are 1 their current financial performance based on
earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization or ebitda
2 their levels of indebtedness and 3 their debt service requirements
since we do not currently expect that our subsidiaries will need to utilize
significant additional borrowings under their credit facilities the primary
risk of a debt covenant violation would result from a deterioration of a
subsidiarys ebitda performance in addition certain of the credit facilities
will require that ebitda increase in future years as covenant calculations
become more restrictive should a covenant violation occur in the future as a
result of a shortfall in ebitda performance or for any other reason we
might be required to make principal payments earlier than currently scheduled
and may not have access to additional borrowings under these facilities as
long as the covenant violation continues any such early principal payments
would have to be made from our existing cash balances

   if we are unable to refinance our subsidiary debt or renegotiate the terms
of such debt we may not be able to meet our debt service requirements
including interest payments on the notes in the future our 9 senior notes
our 9 12 senior notes our 10 34 senior notes and our 9 38 senior notes
require annual cash interest payments of approximately 162 million 119
million 538 million and 422 million respectively prior to november 15
2002 may 15 2004 and august 1 2004 the interest expense on our 10 58
discount notes our 10 38 discount notes and our 11 14 discount notes
respectively will be comprised solely of the amortization of original issue
discount thereafter the 10 58 discount notes the 10 38 discount notes
and the 11 14 discount notes will require annual cash interest payments of
approximately 267 million 519 million and 293 million respectively
prior to december 15 2003 we do not expect to pay cash dividends on our 12
34 exchangeable preferred stock or if issued cash interest on the exchange
debentures thereafter assuming all dividends or interest have been paidin
kind our exchangeable preferred stock or if issued the exchange debentures
will require annual cash dividend or interest payments of approximately 478
million annual cash interest payments on the ccuk bonds are pounds1125
million 164 million in addition our various credit facilities will
require periodic interest payments on amounts borrowed thereunder which
amounts could be substantial

   as a holding company ccic will require distributions or dividends from its
subsidiaries or will be forced to use capital raised in debt and equity
offerings to fund its debt obligations including interest payments on the
cashpay notes and eventually the 10 58 discount notes the 10 38 discount
notes and the 11 14 discount notes the terms of the indebtedness of our
subsidiaries significantly limit their ability to distribute cash to ccic as
a result we will be required to apply a portion of the net proceeds from the
recent debt offerings to fund interest payments on the cashpay notes if we
do not retain sufficient funds from the offerings or any future financing we
may not be able to make our interest payments on the cashpay notes

a interest payments on floating rate debt are estimated based on rates in
    effect during the first quarter of 2002
b we are currently in discussions regarding the deferral of a portion of
    this payment there can be no assurances as to the outcome of these
    discussions

   our joint venture agreements with bell atlantic mobile and gte both now
part of verizon communications provide that upon dissolution of either
venture verizon communications will receive 1 the shares of our common
stock contributed to the venture and 2 a payment equal to a percentage of
the fair market value at the dissolution date of the ventures other net
assets as of december 31 2001 such percentages would be approximately 241
for the bell atlantic mobile venture and 110 for the gte venture the 241
payment for the bell atlantic mobile venture could be paid either in cash or
shares of our common stock at our election the 110 payment for the gte
venture could only be paid in cash a dissolution of either venture may be
triggered 1 by verizon communications at any time following the third
anniversary of the formation of the applicable venture and 2 by us at any
time following the fourth anniversary of such ventures formation subject to
certain penalties if prior to the seventh anniversary our joint venture with
bell atlantic mobile was formed on march 31 1999 and our joint venture with
gte was formed on january 31 2000 see item 1 businessthe company
overview

   our ability to make scheduled payments of principal of or to pay interest
on our debt obligations and our ability to refinance any such debt
obligations will depend on our future performance which to a certain
extent is subject to general economic financial competitive legislative
regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control in addition our
ability to refinance any indebtedness in the future would depend in part on
our maintaining adequate credit ratings from the commercial rating agencies
such credit ratings are dependent on all the liquidity and performance factors
discussed above as well as general expectations that the rating agencies have
regarding the outlook for our business and our industry we anticipate that we
may need to refinance a substantial portion of our indebtedness on or prior to
its scheduled maturity there can be no assurance that we will be able to
effect any required refinancings of our indebtedness on commercially
reasonable terms or at all see item 1 businessrisk factors

restructuring charges and asset writedown charges

   in july 2001 we announced a restructuring of our business in order to
increase operational efficiency and better align costs with anticipated
revenues as part of the restructuring we reduced our global staff by
approximately 312 fulltime employees closed five offices in the united
states and closed our development offices in brazil and europe the actions
taken for the restructuring were substantially completed as of the end of
2001 in connection with the restructuring we recorded nonrecurring cash
charges of approximately 194 million during 2001 related to employee
severance payments and costs of office closures

   we have recorded asset writedown charges of 249 million during 2001 in
connection with the restructuring of our business announced in july 2001 such
noncash charges related to the writedown of certain inventories property
and equipment and other assets

   in march 2002 we announced that we plan to record a nonrecurring
restructuring charge estimated to be between approximately 70 million and
130 million with respect to staff redundancies and the disposition of
certain service lines in connection with our uk operations we expect the
charge to be reflected in our results of operations for 2002 we are also
undertaking a review of our construction in process which may result in
certain open projects being abandoned in 2002 a noncash charge will be
recorded in 2002 for the writedown of such abandoned projects the total
amount of construction in process being reviewed is approximately 38 million

compensation charges related to stock option grants and acquisitions

   we are recognizing noncash general and administrative compensation charges
related to certain stock options granted to employees and executives prior to
our ipo such charges amount to approximately 14 million per year and will
be recognized through the second quarter of 2003

   in july 2000 we issued 1 199473 shares of our common stock and 2
options to purchase 17577 shares of our common stock with an exercise price
of 01 per share in connection with an acquisition by ccuk such shares and
options were deemed to be compensation to the former shareholders of the
acquired company who remained employed by the company as a result ccuk
will recognize noncash general and administrative compensation charges of
approximately 84 million over five years

                                      52

   in september 2000 we issued 336600 shares of our common stock in
connection with an acquisition by ccusa of such shares 170710 were deemed
to be compensation to the former shareholders of the acquired company who
remained employed by the company as a result ccusa will recognize noncash
general and administrative compensation charges of approximately 59 million

impact of recently issued accounting standards

   in july 2001 the financial accounting standards board the fasb issued
statement of financial accounting standards no 141 business combinations
sfas 141 and statement of financial accounting standards no 142
goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 142 sfas 141 prohibits the use
of the poolingofinterests method of accounting for business combinations
and requires that the purchase method be used for all business combinations
after june 30 2001 sfas 141 also changes the manner in which acquired
intangible assets are identified and recognized apart from goodwill further
sfas 141 requires additional disclosures regarding the reasons for business
combinations the allocation of the purchase price to recognized assets and
liabilities and the recognition of goodwill and other intangible assets we
have used the purchase method of accounting since our inception so the
adoption of sfas 141 will not change our method of accounting for business
combinations we will adopt the other recognition and disclosure requirements
of sfas 141 for any future business combinations the transition provisions of
sfas 141 require that the carrying amounts for goodwill and other intangible
assets acquired in prior purchase method business combinations be reviewed and
reclassified in accordance with the new recognition rules such
reclassifications are to be made in conjunction with the adoption of sfas 142
we will apply these transition provisions of sfas 141 as of january 1 2002
and do not believe that they will have any effect on our consolidated
financial statements

   sfas 142 changes the accounting and disclosure requirements for acquired
goodwill and other intangible assets the most significant provision of sfas
142 is that goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives
will no longer be amortized but rather will be tested for impairment on an
annual basis this annual impairment test will involve 1 a step to identify
potential impairment at a reporting unit level based on fair values and 2 a
step to measure the amount of the impairment if any intangible assets with
finite useful lives will continue to be amortized over such lives and tested
for impairment in accordance with our existing policies sfas 142 requires
disclosures about goodwill and other intangible assets in the periods
subsequent to their acquisition including 1 changes in the carrying amount
of goodwill in total and by operating segment 2 the carrying amounts of
intangible assets subject to amortization and those which are not subject to
amortization 3 information about impairment losses recognized and 4 the
estimated amount of intangible asset amortization expense for the next five
years the provisions of sfas 142 are effective for fiscal years beginning
after december 15 2001 we will adopt the requirements of sfas 142 as of
january 1 2002 in addition the nonamortization provisions of sfas 142 are
to be immediately applied for goodwill and other intangible assets acquired in
business combinations subsequent to june 30 2001 sfas 142 requires that
transitional impairment tests be performed at its adoption and provides that
resulting impairment losses for goodwill and other intangible assets be
reported as the effect of a change in accounting principle we have not yet
completed our transitional impairment tests but based on preliminary results
of those tests do not currently believe that an impairment loss for goodwill
and other intangible assets will be recorded upon the adoption of sfas 142 we
expect that our depreciation and amortization expense will decrease by
approximately 621 million per year as a result of the adoption of sfas 142

   in october 2001 the fasb issued statement of financial accounting
standards no 144 accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived
assets sfas 144 sfas 144 supersedes statement of financial accounting
standards no 121 accounting for the impairment of longlived assets and for
longlived assets to be disposed of sfas 121 but retains many of its
fundamental provisions sfas 144 also clarifies certain measurement and

item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

   as a result of our international operating investing and financing
activities we are exposed to market risks which include changes in foreign
currency exchange rates and interest rates which may adversely affect our
results of operations and financial position in attempting to minimize the
risks andor costs associated with such activities we seek to manage exposure
to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates where
economically prudent to do so

   certain of the financial instruments we have used to obtain capital are
subject to market risks from fluctuations in market interest rates the
majority of our financial instruments however are longterm fixed interest
rate notes and debentures a fluctuation in market interest rates of one
percentage point in 2002 would impact our interest expense by approximately
102 million as of december 31 2001 we have approximately 11721 million
of floating rate indebtedness of which approximately 1500 million has been
effectively converted to fixed rate indebtedness through the use of interest
rate swap agreements

   the majority of our foreign currency transactions are denominated in the
british pound sterling or the australian dollar which are the functional
currencies of ccuk and ccal respectively as a result of ccuks and ccals
transactions being denominated and settled in such functional currencies the
risks associated with currency fluctuations are generally limited to foreign
currency translation adjustments we do not currently hedge against foreign
currency translation risks and believe that foreign currency exchange risk is
not significant to our operations

   as discussed in item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial
condition and results of operationsliquidity and capital resources we had
deposited approximately 3838 million in cash into a eurodenominated escrow
account in connection with the raiway transaction at the time of the deposit
the funds were exchanged at an average rate of euro 100  08984 since
approval of the transaction was not received from the italian regulatory
authorities the escrow deposit was returned to us in november 2001 as a
result we recognized a foreign exchange gain in the fourth quarter of 2001 of
approximately 03 million in our results of operations as other income
expense

     the additional demand for towers and wireless infrastructure created by
      new entrants into the wireless communications industry

     the privatization of staterun broadcast transmission networks and

     the introduction of wireless technologies including broadband data or
      3g technology

   our main businesses are leasing antenna space on wireless and broadcast
towers that can accommodate multiple tenants and operating analog and digital
broadcast transmission networks and wireless networks we also provide related
services to our customers including network design radio frequency
engineering site acquisition site development and construction antenna
installation and network management and maintenance we believe that our full
service capabilities are a key competitive advantage in forming strategic
partnerships to acquire large concentrations of towers or tower clusters and
in winning contracts for tower acquisitions management and construction along
with wireless and transmission network management

   our primary business in the united states is the leasing of antenna space
to wireless carriers we believe that by owning and managing large tower
clusters we are able to offer customers the ability to fulfill rapidly and
efficiently their network expansion plans across particular markets or
regions our acquisition strategy has been focused on adding tower clusters to
our tower portfolio as of december 31 2000 we had tower clusters in 34 of
the 50 largest us metropolitan areas and 68 of the 100 largest us
metropolitan areas

   our primary business in the united kingdom which is conducted through our
subsidiary crown castle uk holdings limited or ccuk is the operation of
television and radio broadcast transmission networks and the leasing of
antenna space to wireless carriers following our 1997 acquisition of the
bbcs broadcast and tower infrastructure we were awarded longterm contracts
to provide the bbc and other broadcasters analog and digital transmission
services we also lease antenna space to wireless operators in the united
kingdom on the towers we acquired from the bbc as well as on various towers
that we acquired from wireless carriers or that we have constructed we have
nationwide broadcast and wireless coverage in the united kingdom

construct approximately 1500 towers at an estimated aggregate cost of
approximately 330 million for lease to wireless carriers such as verizon
cingular nextel hutchison and bt cellnet the actual number of towers built
may vary depending on acquisition opportunities and potential buildtosuit
contracts from large wireless carriers

growth strategy

   our objective is to become the premier global owner and operator of tower
and transmission networks for wireless communications and broadcast companies
we believe our experience in expanding and marketing our tower clusters as
well as our experience in owning and operating analog and digital transmission
networks positions us to accomplish this objective the key elements of our
business strategy are to

     maximize utilization of our tower capacity we are seeking to take
      advantage of the substantial operating leverage of our site rental
      business by increasing the number of antenna leases on our owned and
      managed communications sites many of our towers have significant
      capacity available for additional antenna space rental and increased
      utilization of that tower capacity can be achieved at low incremental
      cost we believe there is substantial demand for such capacity both
      from existing carriers and broadcasters and from new carriers and
      broadcasters we also believe that the extra capacity on our tower
      portfolios will be highly desirable to new entrants into the wireless
      communications industry such carriers are able to launch service
      quickly and relatively inexpensively by designing the deployment of
      their networks based on our attractive existing tower portfolios
      further we intend to continue to selectively build and acquire
      additional towers to improve the coverage of our existing tower
      portfolios to further increase their attractiveness we intend to
      continue to use targeted sales and marketing techniques to increase
      utilization of and investment return on our existing newly constructed
      and acquired towers

     utilize the expertise of our us uk and australian personnel to
      capture global growth opportunities we are seeking to leverage the
      skills of our personnel in the united states the united kingdom and
      australia we believe that our ability to manage networks including
      the transmission of signals will be an important competitive advantage
      in our pursuit of global growth opportunities as evidenced by our
      transactions with the bbc one 2 one verizon communications
      bellsouth powertel and cable  wireless optus and our agreement to
      acquire and operate the tower network of vodafone australia with our
      wireless communications and broadcast transmission network design and
      radio frequency engineering expertise we are well positioned to 1
      partner with major wireless carriers to assume ownership of their
      existing towers 2 provide buildtosuit towers for wireless carriers
      and broadcasters 3 acquire existing broadcast transmission networks
      that are being privatized around the world 4 manage and operate
      wireless networks and 5 deploy new wireless technologies

     partner with wireless carriers to assume ownership of their existing
      towers in addition to our two joint ventures with verizon
      communications via its indirect subsidiaries bell atlantic mobile
      inc and gte wireless inc and the bellsouth and bellsouth dcs
      transactions we continue to seek partnership opportunities with other
      major wireless carriers to assume ownership of their existing towers
      directly or through joint ventures or to control their towers through
      contractual arrangements we believe the primary criteria of such
      carriers in selecting a company to own and operate their wireless
      communications infrastructure is the companys perceived capability to
      maintain the integrity of their networks including their transmission
      signals therefore we believe that those companies with a proven track
      record of providing endtoend services will be best positioned to
      successfully acquire access to such wireless communications
      infrastructure we believe that similar opportunities exist globally as
      the wireless communications industry further expands as evidenced by
      our acquisition and operation of the tower networks of cable  wireless
      optus and vodafone australia in australia and the turnkey deployment of
      one 2 ones wireless network in northern ireland

     build new towers for wireless carriers as wireless carriers continue
      to expand and fill in their service areas and to deploy new
      technologies they will require additional communications sites and
      will have to build new towers where multitenant towers are not
      available we are pursuing these buildtosuit opportunities to build
      new towers for wireless carriers leveraging on our ability to offer a
      wide range of related services

     acquire existing broadcast transmission networks in 1997 ccuk
      successfully acquired the privatized uk broadcast transmission
      network of the bbc in addition we have implemented the rollout of
      digital television transmission services throughout the united kingdom
      as a result of this experience we are well positioned to acquire other
      stateowned analog and digital broadcast transmission networks globally
      when opportunities arise these stateowned broadcast transmission
      networks typically enjoy premier sites giving an acquiror the ability
      to offer unused antenna capacity to new and existing radio and
      television broadcasters and wireless carriers as well as to install
      new technologies such as digital terrestrial transmission services in
      addition our experience in broadcast transmission services allows us
      to consider when attractive opportunities arise acquiring wireless
      transmission networks as well as associated wireless communications
      infrastructure we are currently pursuing certain international
      acquisition and privatization opportunities

 us operations

  overview

   our primary business in the united states is the leasing of antenna space
on multiple tenant towers to a variety of wireless carriers under longterm
lease contracts supporting our competitive position in the site rental
business we maintain inhouse expertise in and offer our customers
infrastructure and network support services that include network design and
site selection site acquisition site development and construction and
antenna installation

   we lease antenna space to our customers on our owned leased and managed
towers we generally receive fees for installing customers equipment and
antennas on a tower and also receive monthly rental payments from customers
payable under site rental leases that generally range in length from three to
five years our us customers include such companies as verizon cingular
powertel nextel sprint pcs att wireless motorola and skytel we also
provide tower space to private network operators and various federal and local
government agencies such as the fbi the irs the dea and the us postal
service

   at december 31 2000 we owned or managed 9872 sites including 107
rooftop sites in the united states and puerto rico these towers and rooftop
sites are located predominantly in the eastern midwestern and southwestern
united states along with puerto rico a substantial number of our towers were
acquired through transactions consummated within the past two years

   through the powertel acquisition which closed in june 1999 we control and
operate 672 towers these towers represent substantially all of powertels
owned towers in its 19 ghz wireless network in the southeastern and
midwestern united states approximately 90 of these towers are clustered in
seven southeastern states providing coverage of such metropolitan areas as
atlanta birmingham jacksonville memphis and louisville and a number of
major connecting highway corridors in the southeast these towers are
complementary to bellsouths 850 mhz tower portfolio in the southeast and have
minimal coverage overlap substantially all of these towers are over 100 feet
tall and can accommodate multiple tenants

   through the bellsouth and bellsouth dcs transactions which were
substantially completed in september 2000 we control and operate 2703
towers these towers represent 1 substantially all of the towers in
bellsouths 850 mhz wireless network in the southeastern and midwestern united
states providing coverage of 12 of the top 50 us metropolitan areas
including miami atlanta tampa nashville and indianapolis and 2
substantially all of the towers in bellsouth dcss 19 ghz wireless network in
north carolina south carolina east tennessee and parts of georgia a
substantial majority of these towers are over 100 feet tall and can
accommodate multiple tenants

   our joint venture with bell atlantic mobile an indirect subsidiary of
verizon communications controlled and operated 1921 towers as of december
31 2000 through our joint venture with gte wireless also an indirect
subsidiary of verizon communications we now control and operate 2843
towers including 497 towers which had been acquired by gte wireless from
ameritech corp these towers represent substantially all the towers now used
in the 850 mhz wireless network of verizon communications wireless business
in the eastern midwestern and southwestern united states and provide coverage
of 22 of the top 50 us metropolitan areas including new york chicago
houston washington dc philadelphia boston and phoenix a substantial
majority of these towers are over 100 feet tall and can accommodate multiple
tenants we currently own 5687 of the joint venture with bell atlantic
mobile and bell atlantic mobile owns the remaining 4313 we currently own
8198 of the joint venture with gte wireless and gte wireless owns the
remaining 1802 gte wireless has the right to contribute certain additional
towers to the joint venture on terms substantially similar to the formation
agreement including 1 currently owned towers not contributed pursuant to
the formation agreement or 2 towers subsequently acquired in cellular or pcs
markets east of the mississippi

   each of the joint ventures with verizon communications entered into master
buildtosuit agreements under which each joint venture will build and own up
to 500 additional towers to be built for the wireless

communications business of verizon communications which does business as
verizon wireless over a fiveyear period in addition following the building
of such 500 sites the bell atlantic mobile joint venture will have a right of
first refusal to construct up to the next 200 towers to be built for verizon
wireless the number of towers built under the gte wireless buildtosuit
agreement is reduced by the number of certain towers built under the buildto
suit agreement with the bell atlantic mobile joint venture and certain other
tower builds further we have entered into similar agreements with bellsouth
as part of the bellsouth transaction to construct at least 500 towers on
behalf of bellsouth in the region covered by that transaction over the five
year period following the initial closing of that transaction as of march 1
2001 we had built approximately 70 273 and 113 towers under each of the
buildtosuit agreements with the gte wireless joint venture the bell
atlantic mobile joint venture and bellsouth respectively

   we are seeking to enter into arrangements with other wireless carriers and
independent tower operators to acquire additional tower portfolios however
we believe that acquisitions from major carriers in the united states are
substantially complete

   we also seek to capitalize on our network design expertise to construct new
towers we plan to continue to build towers in areas where carriers signals
fail to transmit in their coverage area the areas commonly known as dead
zones are attractive tower locations when population density and perceived
demand are such that we believe the economics of constructing such towers are
justified we build towers that can accommodate multiple tenants the multiple
tenant design of these towers obviates the need for expensive and time
consuming modifications to upgrade undersized towers saving critical capital
and time for carriers facing timetomarket constraints the towers are also
designed to easily add additional customers and the equipment shelters are
built to accommodate another floor for new equipment and air conditioning
units when additional capacity is needed the tower site is zoned for multiple
carriers at the time the tower is constructed to allow new carriers to quickly
utilize the site in addition the towers equipment shelters and site
compounds are engineered to protect and maintain the structural integrity of
the site

  site rental

   in the united states we rent antenna space on our owned and managed towers
and rooftops to a variety of carriers operating cellular personal
communication services specialized mobile radio enhanced specialized mobile
radio paging and other networks

   tower site rental we lease space to our customers on our owned and managed
towers we generally receive fees for installing customers equipment and
antennas on a tower and also receive monthly rental payments from customers
payable under site leases in the united states the majority of our
outstanding customer leases and the new leases typically entered into by us
have original terms of five years with three or four optional renewal periods
of five years each and provide for annual price increases based on the
consumer price index the lease agreements relating to network acquisitions
generally have a base term of ten years with multiple renewal options each
typically ranging from five to ten years

   we also provide a range of site maintenance services in order to support
and enhance our site rental business we believe that by offering services
such as antenna base station and tower maintenance and security monitoring
we are able to offer quality services to retain our existing customers and
attract future customers to our communication sites we were the first site
management company in the united states selected by a major wireless
communications company to exclusively manage its tower network and market the
network to other carriers for multitenant use of their towers

   we have existing master lease agreements with most major wireless carriers
including att wireless cingular verizon nextel and sprint pcs which
provide certain terms including economic terms that govern new leases
entered into by such parties during the term of their master lease agreements
we believe that our strategic clusters of towers will cause the master lease
agreements to cover numerous towers as both incumbent and insurgent carriers
expand these master lease agreements typically have an initial lease term of
ten years with multiple renewal options each typically ranging from five to
ten years

                                       5
page

   we have significant site rental opportunities in connection with our larger
tower acquisition transactions as a result of the fact that such transactions
usually involve a master lease agreement of some type with the transferring
carrier and the opportunity to lease additional space with other carriers for
example in connection with each of the joint ventures with verizon
communications we entered into a master lease agreement under which its
domestic wireless businesses lease antenna space on the towers transferred to
the joint ventures as well as the towers built under the buildtosuit
agreements also in connection with the bellsouth and bellsouth dcs
transactions we are paid a monthly site maintenance fee from bellsouth for
its use or maintenance of space on the towers we control further in
connection with the powertel acquisition we entered into an agreement under
which the sellers rent space on the towers we acquired from them in each of
these transactions we are permitted to lease additional space on the towers
to third parties

  network services

   we design build and operate our own communication sites we have developed
an inhouse expertise in certain valueadded services that we offer to the
wireless communications and broadcasting industries because we are a provider
of total systems with endtoend design construction and operating
expertise we offer our customers the flexibility of choosing between the
provision of a full readytooperate network infrastructure or any of the

   network design and site selection we have extensive experience in network
design and engineering and site selection while we maintain sophisticated
network design services primarily to support the location and construction of
our multiple tenant towers we do from time to time provide network design and
site selection services to carriers and other customers on a consulting
contract basis our network design and site selection services provide our
customers with relevant information including recommendations regarding
location and height of towers appropriate types of antennas transmission
power and frequency selection and related fixed network considerations in
2000 we provided network design services primarily for our own portfolios and
also for certain customers including verizon att wireless sprint pcs and
nextel these customers were typically charged on a timeandmaterials basis

   site acquisition in the united states we are engaged in site acquisition
services for our own purposes and for third parties based on data generated
in the network design and site selection process a search ring generally
of a onemile radius is issued to the site acquisition department for
verification of possible land purchases or leases within the search ring
within each search ring geographic information systems specialists select the
most suitable sites based on demographics traffic patterns and signal
characteristics once a site is selected and the terms of an option to
purchase or lease the site are completed a survey is prepared and the
resulting site plan is created the plan is then submitted to the local
zoningplanning board for approval if the site is approved our construction
department takes over the process of constructing the site

   we have provided site acquisition services to numerous customers including
verizon cingular att wireless sprint pcs and nextel these customers
engage us for such site acquisition services on either a fixed price contract
or a timeandmaterials basis

   site development and construction and antenna installation we have
provided site development and construction and antenna installation services
to the us communications industry for over 19 years we have extensive
experience in the development and construction of tower sites and the
installation of antenna microwave dishes and electrical and
telecommunications lines our site development and construction services
include clearing sites laying foundations and electrical and
telecommunications lines and constructing equipment shelters and towers we
have designed and built and presently maintain tower sites for a number of our
wireless communications customers and also for a substantial part of our own
tower network we can provide costeffective and timely completion of
construction projects in part because our site development personnel are
crosstrained in all areas of site development construction and antenna
installation we generally set prices for each site development or
construction service separately customers are billed for these services on a
fixed price

   our construction management capabilities reflect our extensive experience
in the construction of networks and towers for example we were instrumental
in launching networks for sprint pcs nextel and aerial communications in the
pittsburgh metropolitan area in addition we supplied these carriers with all
of their project management and engineering services which included antenna
design and interference analyses

   in 2000 we provided site development and construction or antenna
installation services to a majority of our new tower site tenants in the
united states including verizon cingular att wireless sprint pcs and

   a team of national account managers maintains and enhances our close
relationships with our largest customers these managers work to develop new
tower construction site leasing services and site management opportunities
as well as to ensure that customers emerging needs are translated into new
products and services this group also manages major sales opportunities
including turnkey network deployments broadcast networks and backhaul
transmission services

   sales personnel in our regional offices develop and maintain close local
relationships with carriers that are expanding their networks entering new
markets bringing new technologies to market or requiring maintenance or add
on business all types of wireless carriers are targeted including broadcast
cellular paging personal communications services microwave and twoway
radio 911 government agencies and utility and transportation companies our
objective is to presell capacity on our new towers prior to construction and
to lease space on existing towers we seek to maintain good public and
community relations at a local level through efforts including community
events sponsorships and charitable work

   in addition to our fulltime sales and marketing staff a number of senior
managers spend a significant portion of their time on sales and marketing
activities these managers call on existing and prospective customers and also
seek greater visibility in the industry through speaking engagements and
articles in national publications furthermore many of these managers have
been recognized as industry experts are regularly quoted in articles are
called on to testify at local hearings and are asked to draft local zoning
ordinances

  competition

   in the united states we compete with other independent tower owners some
of which also provide site rental and network services wireless carriers
which own and operate their own tower networks service companies that provide
engineering and site acquisition services and other potential competitors
such as utilities outdoor advertisers and broadcasters some of which have
already entered the tower industry wireless carriers that own and operate
their own tower networks generally are substantially larger and have greater
financial resources than we have we believe that tower location capacity
price quality of service and density within a geographic market historically
have been and will continue to be the most significant competitive factors
affecting tower rental companies we also compete for acquisition and new
tower construction opportunities with wireless carriers site developers and
other independent tower operating companies we believe that competition for
tower site acquisitions will increase and that additional competitors will
enter the tower market some of which may have greater financial resources
than us

   the following is a list of the larger independent tower companies that we
compete with in the united states american tower corp spectrasite pinnacle
towers and sba communications

   we believe that the majority of our competitors in the site acquisition
business operate within local market areas exclusively while a small minority
of firms appear to offer their services nationally including sba
communications whalen  company and gearon  company a subsidiary of
american tower corp we offer our services nationwide and we believe we are
currently one of the largest providers of site development services to the
us and international markets the market includes participants from a
variety of market segments offering individual or a combination of competing
services the field of competitors includes site acquisition consultants
zoning consultants real estate firms rightofway consulting firms
construction companies tower ownersmanagers radio frequency engineering
consultants telecommunications equipment vendors which provide turnkey site
development services through multiple subcontractors and carriers internal
staff we believe that carriers base their decisions on site development
services on certain criteria including a companys experience track record
local reputation price and time for completion of a project we believe that
we compete favorably in these areas

 uk operations

  overview

   we own and operate through ccuk one of the worlds most established
television and radio transmission networks and are expanding our leasing of
antenna space on our towers to a variety of wireless carriers we provide
transmission services for four of the six digital terrestrial television
multiplexes in the uk two bbc analog television services six national bbc
radio services including the first digital audio broadcast service in the
united kingdom 44 local bbc radio stations and two national commercial radio
services through our network of transmitters which reach 994 of the uk
population these transmitters are located on approximately 1300 towers more
than half of which we own and the balance of which are licensed to us under a
sitesharing agreement with national transcommunications limited or ntl our
principal broadcast competitor in the united kingdom we have also secured
longterm contracts to provide digital television transmission services to the
bbc and ondigital see businessuk operationssignificant contracts in
december 1999 we entered into a contract to develop a new wireless carrier
network service for one 2 one in northern ireland in addition to providing
transmission services we also lease antenna space on our transmission
infrastructure and on our over 1500 communications towers in the united
kingdom to various communications service providers including one 2 one bt
cellnet orange and vodafone and provide telecommunications network
installation and maintenance services and engineering consulting services

   our core revenue generating activity in the united kingdom is the analog
and digital terrestrial transmission of radio and television programs
broadcast by the bbc ccuks transmission business which was formerly owned
by the bbc was privatized under the broadcasting act 1996 and sold to ccuk in
february 1997 at the time the bbc home service transmission business was
acquired ccuk entered into a 10year transmission contract with the bbc for
the provision of terrestrial analog television and analog and digital radio
transmission services in the united kingdom the digital contract was added in
1998 as described below for the 12 months ended december 31 2000
approximately 442 of ccuks consolidated revenues were derived from the
provision of services to the bbc

   at december 31 2000 we owned or managed 2330 sites including 51 rooftop
sites in the united kingdom the 51 revenue producing rooftop sites are
occupied by ccukowned transmitters from which we provide services to our
broadcast network contract customers but these sites are not otherwise
available for leasing to our customers our sites are located throughout
england wales scotland and northern ireland

   we expect to significantly expand our existing tower portfolios in the
united kingdom by building and acquiring additional towers we believe our
existing tower network encompasses many of the most desirable tower locations
in the united kingdom for wireless communications however due to the shorter
range over which communications signals carry especially newer technologies
such as personal communications networks as compared to broadcast signals
wireless communications providers require a denser portfolio of towers to
cover a given area therefore in order to increase the attractiveness of our
tower portfolios to wireless communications providers we will seek to build
or acquire new communications towers using our team of over 300 engineers
with stateoftheart network design and radio frequency engineering
expertise we locate sites and design towers that will be attractive to
multiple tenants we seek to leverage such expertise by entering into new
tower construction contracts with various carriers such as bt cellnet
dolphin vodafone energis highway one one 2 one orange and scottish
telecom thereby securing an anchor tenant for a site before incurring capital
expenditures for the site buildout

   on march 31 1999 ccuk completed the one 2 one transaction under which
ccuk acquired 821 towers these towers represent substantially all the towers

  transmission business

   analog for the 12 months ended december 31 2000 ccuk generated
approximately 363 of its revenues from the provision of analog broadcast
transmission services to the bbc under the bbc analog transmission contract
we provide terrestrial transmission services for the bbcs analog television
and radio programs and certain other related services including bbc digital
radio for an initial 10year term through march 31 2007 see businessuk
operationssignificant contracts for the 12 months ended december 31 2000
the bbc analog transmission contract generated revenues of approximately
pounds521 million 790 million for us

   in addition to the bbc analog transmission contract we have separate
contracts to provide maintenance and transmission services for two national
radio stations virgin radio and talk radio the virgin radio contract is for
a period of eight years expiring march 31 2001 extension terms are currently
being negotiated with virgin radio the talk radio contract commenced on
february 4 1995 and expires on december 31 2008

   we own all of the transmission equipment used for broadcasting the bbcs
uk radio and television programs whether located on one of ccuks sites or
on an ntl or other thirdparty site as of december 31 2000 ccuk had 3787
transmitters of which 2507 were for television broadcasting and 1280 were
for radio

   a few of our most powerful television transmitters together cover the
majority of the uk population the coverage achieved by the less powerful
transmitters is relatively low but is important to the bbcs ambition of
attaining universal coverage in the united kingdom this is illustrated by the
following analysis of the population coverage of our analog television
transmitters



                                                                       combined

      all    994


   all of our uk transmitters are capable of unmanned operation and are
maintained by mobile maintenance teams from 27 bases located across the united
kingdom access to the sites is strictly controlled for operational and
security reasons and buildings at 227 of the sites are protected by security
alarms connected to ccuks technical operations centre at warwick the site
sharing agreement provides us with reciprocal access rights to ntls broadcast
transmission sites on which we have equipment

                                      10
page

   certain of our transmitters that serve large populations or important
geographic areas have been designated as priority transmitters these
transmitters have duplicated equipment so that a single failure should not
result in total loss of service but will merely result in an outputpower
reduction that does not significantly degrade the service to most viewers and
listeners

   digital in 2000 we completed the rollout of the 80 station network
required under our contracts with the holders including the bbc of four of
the six licenses issued in the uk for digital terrestrial television
services dtt we are required as part of our dtt contracts to provide new
transmission and distribution infrastructure networks and multiplex equipment
for our dtt customers including site upgrades new transmitters and
associated systems of these sites 49 are owned by us and the remainder are
on ntl towers pursuant to a site sharing arrangement our costs to add new
transmitters and associated systems was approximately pounds1000 million
150 million

   we successfully began commercial operation of the digital terrestrial
television networks from an initial 22 transmission sites on november 15
1998 we completed the 80 transmission site upgrade in january 2000 this
launch and the subsequent upgrade marked the first stage of the project to
introduce the digital broadcast system that will eventually replace
conventional analog television services in the united kingdom initially in
january 2000 these first 80 sites achieved a national uk population
coverage in accordance with the revised definition of coverage by the
independent television commission of 56 of the uk population where service
from all six multiplexes overlap with an 81 coverage of the uk population
for the best individual multiplex we have accepted an invitation from the uk
television regulator the independent television commission to play a role in
planning further digital terrestrial television network extensions in
addition as of december 31 2000 the overlapping coverage for all six
multiplexes was improved from 56 to 61 of the national population as result
of frequency equalization projects which we initiated and consummated in
consultation with our customers and uk government regulators as a result of
these projects our digital contract revenues have increased by approximately
pounds700000 1047 million per year

   we currently provide transmission services for digital radio broadcasts in
the united kingdom in september 1995 the bbc launched over our transmission
network its initial national digital radio service and this service is now
broadcast to approximately 60 of the uk population a license for an
independent national digital radio network was awarded to the digital one
consortium during 1998 we are providing accommodation and access to masts
towers and antennas at 24 transmission sites to digital one in addition
local digital radio licenses were awarded during 1999 and on july 14 2000 we
were awarded a 12 year contract with switchdigital london limited to provide
their london local digital radio network service

  site rental

   the bbc transmission network provides a valuable initial portfolio for the
creation of wireless communications networks as of december 31 2000
approximately 245 companies rented antenna space on approximately 2090 of
ccuks 2330 towers and rooftops these site rental agreements have normally
been for three to 12 years and are generally subject to rent reviews every
three years site sharing customers are generally charged annually in advance
according to ratecards that are based on the antenna size and position on the
tower our largest site rental customer in the united kingdom is ntl under the
sitesharing agreement and the digital broadcasting site sharing agreement
these agreements generated approximately pounds109 million 165 million
of site rental revenue for the year ended december 31 2000

   as in the united states we provide a range of site maintenance services in
the united kingdom in order to support and enhance our site rental business
we complement our uk transmission experience with our site management
experience in the united states to provide customers with a topoftheline
package of service and technical support

   other than ntl ccuks largest by revenue site rental customers consist
mainly of wireless carriers such as bt cellnet one 2 one orange and
vodafone revenues from these nonbbc sources are becoming an

                                      11
page

increasing portion of ccuks total uk revenue base as the acquired bbc home
service transmission business is no longer constrained by governmental
restrictions on the bbcs commercial activities we believe that the demand
for site rental from communication service providers will increase in line
with the expected growth of these communication services along with the
deployment of new technologies such as 3g mobile communications in the
united kingdom as demonstrated by our recent multisite rental commitment
contracts with hutchison and bt cellnet

   we have master lease agreements with all of the major uk
telecommunications site users including british telecom cable  wireless
communications bt cellnet dolphin energis highway one one 2 one orange
scottish telecom and vodafone airtouch these agreements typically specify the
terms and conditions including pricing and volume discount plans under which
these customers have access to all sites within our uk portfolio customers
make orders for specific sites using the standard terms included in the master
lease agreements as of december 31 2000 there were approximately 866
applications in process for installations at existing sites under such
agreements

  network services

   ccuk provides broadcast and telecommunications engineering services to
various customers in the united kingdom we retained substantially all of the
bbc home service transmission business employees when we acquired that
business accordingly we have engineering and technical staff of the caliber
and experience necessary not only to meet the requirements of our current
customer base but also to meet the challenges of developing digital
technology within the united kingdom ccuk has worked with several
telecommunications operators on design and build projects as they rollout
their networks with the expertise of our engineers and technical staff we
are a provider of complete systems to the wireless communications and
broadcast industries

   network design and site selection we have extensive experience in network
design and engineering and site selection our uk customers therefore also
receive the benefit of our sophisticated network design and site selection
services

   in december 1999 ccuk and one 2 one entered into an agreement under which
ccuk will establish a turnkey mobile network for one 2 one in northern
ireland the majority of the network is expected to be completed by the end of
2001 ccuk will provide all cell planning acquisition design build
operation and maintenance services related to the network the agreement with
one 2 one is for an initial term of 11 years we currently own and operate
approximately 130 tower sites in northern ireland and we expect that one 2
one will be a tenant on substantially all of these sites as part of the
network

   in june 2000 ccuk was awarded a contract for the first phase of a three
phase network rollout of europes first planned 3g network on the isle of man
the network is being built by nec and siemens for manx telecom a whollyowned
subsidiary of british telecom ccuks role is to provide turnkey project
management installation and commissioning of the 3g radio access network
including site planning design and build in march 2001 ccuk was awarded a
further contract with manx telecom for the second and third phases with
additional responsibility for radio frequency planning as well as site
planning design build and installation the network will contain
approximately 30 sites and service is expected to be launched in july 2001

   site acquisition as in the united states in the united kingdom we are
involved in site acquisition services for our own purposes and for third
parties we recognize that the site acquisition phase often carries the
highest risk for a project to ensure the greatest possible likelihood of
success and timely acquisition we combine a desktop survey of potential
barriers to development with a physical site search with relevant analyses
assessments and where necessary surveys we seek to take advantage of our
experience in site acquisition and colocation when meeting with local
planning authorities

   site development and antenna installation we use a combination of external
and internal resources for site construction our engineers are experienced in
both construction techniques and construction management

                                      12

ensuring an efficient and simple construction phase selected civil
contractors are managed by ccuk staff for the ground works phase specialist
erection companies with whom we have a long association are used for tower
installation final antenna installation is undertaken by our own experienced
teams

  significant contracts

   ccuks principal analog broadcast transmission contract is the bbc analog
transmission contract ccuk also has entered into two digital television
transmission contracts the bbc digital transmission contract and the
ondigital digital transmission contract under the sitesharing agreement
ccuk also gives ntl access to facilities to provide broadcast transmission to
nonccuk customers ccuk also has longterm service agreements with broadcast
customers such as virgin radio talk radio and switchdigital in addition
ccuk has several agreements with telecommunication providers including
leases site management contracts and independent contractor agreements the
recently announced agreements with hutchison and bt cellnet contain additional
lease commitments for a minimum of 5500 ccuk sites ccuk has also entered
into contracts to design and build infrastructure for customers such as bt
cellnet one 2 one orange scottish telecom and vodafone airtouch including
the turnkey network contract for one 2 one in northern ireland

   bbc analog transmission contract ccuk entered into a 10year transmission
contract with the bbc for the provision of terrestrial analog television and
analog and digital radio transmission services in the united kingdom at the
time the bbc home service transmission business was acquired the bbc analog
transmission contract provides for charges of approximately pounds465
million 695 million to be payable by the bbc to ccuk for the year ended
march 31 1998 and each year thereafter through the termination date adjusted
annually at the inflation rate less 1 in addition for the duration of the
contract an annual payment of pounds300000 448650 is payable by the
bbc for additional broadcastrelated services at the bbcs request since
october 1997 the number of television broadcast hours has been increased to
24 hours per day for the bbcs two national television services which has
added over pounds500000 748000 annually to the payments made by the bbc
to us on july 16 1999 the bbc and ccuk amended the transmission contract to
allow ccuk to provide certain liaison services to the bbc

   the bbc analog transmission contract also provides for ccuk to be liable to
the bbc for service credits ie rebates of its charges in the event that
certain standards of service are not attained as a result of what the contract
characterizes as accountable faults or the failure to meet certain response
times in relation to making repairs at certain key sites we believe that
ccuk is wellequipped to meet the bbcs service requirements by reason of the
collective experience its existing management gained while working with the
bbc ccuk is subject to periodic performance reviews and to date has achieved
a 100 clean sheet performance incurring no service credit penalties

   the initial term of the bbc analog transmission contract ends on march 31
2007 thereafter the bbc analog transmission contract may be terminated with
12 months prior notice by either of the parties expiring on march 31 in any
contract year from and including march 31 2007 it may also be terminated
earlier

     by mutual agreement between ccuk and the bbc

     by one party upon the bankruptcy or insolvency of the other party
      within the meaning of section 123 of the insolvency act 1986

     upon certain force majeure events with respect to the contract as a
      whole or with respect to any site in which case the termination will
      relate to that site only

     by the nondefaulting party upon a material breach by the other party
      and

     upon the occurrence of certain change of control events as defined in
      the bbc analog transmission contract

ccuk for periods ranging from three to five years commencing february 28
1997

   in july 1998 the bbc consented to the reduction of tdfs ownership
interest in ccuk to 20 in addition on july 5 2000 with the bbcs consent
tdf divested its remaining interest in ccuk and relinquished all of its
governance rights in ccuk as a result of recommendations by the department of
trade and industry in the united kingdom to the office of fair trading that
as a condition to not referring a proposed 25 equity investment in ntl by
tdfs parent france telecom to the competition commission tdf should
undertake to dispose of its shareholding in ccuk and the company

   ondigital digital transmission contract in 1997 the independent
television commission awarded ondigital three of the five available commercial
digital terrestrial television multiplexes for new program services we bid
for and won the 12year contract from ondigital to build and operate its
digital television transmission network the contract provides for
approximately pounds200 million 299 million of revenue per year from
2001 to 2008 with lesser amounts payable before and after these years and
with service credits repayable for performance below agreed thresholds
additional revenues are also being paid in relation to multiplex frequency
equalization projects initiated by ccuk in 2000

   bbc digital transmission contract in 1998 we bid for and won the 12year

period with service credits repayable for performance below agreed
thresholds there is a termination provision during the threemonth period
following the fifth anniversary of our commencement of digital terrestrial
transmission services for the bbc exercisable by the bbc but only if the
bbcs board of governors determines in its sole discretion that digital
television in the united kingdom does not have sufficient viewership to
justify continued digital television broadcasts under this provision the bbc
will pay us a termination fee in cash that substantially recovers our capital
investment in the network and any residual ongoing operating costs and
liabilities like the bbc analog transmission contract the contract is
terminable upon the occurrence of certain change of control events additional
revenues are also being paid in relation to multiplex frequency equalization
projects initiated by ccuk in 2000

   bt digital distribution contract under the bbc digital transmission
contract and the ondigital digital transmission contract in addition to
providing digital terrestrial transmission services ccuk has agreed to
provide for the distribution of the bbcs and ondigitals broadcast signals

consequently in may 1998 ccuk entered into a 12year distribution contract
with british telecommunications plc with provisions for extending the term
in which british telecom has agreed to provide fully duplicated fiberbased
digital distribution services with penalties for late delivery and service
credits for failure to deliver 9999 availability

   sitesharing agreement in order to optimize service coverage for
television and radio services and to enable viewers to receive all analog uhf
television services using one receiving antenna the bbc as the predecessor
to ccuk and ntl made arrangements to share certain broadcast sites this
arrangement was introduced in the 1960s when uhf television broadcasting began
in the united kingdom in addition to service coverage advantages the
arrangement also minimizes costs and avoids the difficulties of obtaining
additional sites

   on september 10 1991 the bbc and ntl entered into the site sharing
agreement which set out the commercial site sharing terms under which the
parties were entitled to share each others sites for any television and radio
services

   under the sitesharing agreement the party that is the owner lessee or
licensee of each site is defined as the station owner the other party the
sharer is entitled to request a license to use certain facilities at

                                      14

that site the site sharing agreement and each site license provide for the
station owner to be paid a commercial license fee in accordance with the site
sharing agreement ratecard and for the sharer to be responsible in normal
circumstances for the costs of accommodation and equipment used exclusively
by it the site sharing agreement may be terminated with five years prior
notice on december 31 2005 or on any tenth anniversary of that date as no
notice was served in 2000 the next termination date is december 31 2015 it
may also be terminated

     following a material breach by either party that if remediable is not
      remedied within 30 days of notice of such breach by the nonbreaching
      party

     on the bankruptcy or insolvency of either party and

     if either party ceases to carry on a broadcast transmission business or
      function

  competition

   ntl is ccuks primary competition in the terrestrial broadcast transmission
market in the united kingdom ntl provides analog transmission services to
itv channels 4 and 5 and s4c digital television networks a number of local
analog commercial radio stations and digital one national radio ntl has also
been awarded the transmission contract for two of the six digital terrestrial
television multiplexes ccuk has been awarded service contracts for the other
four multiplexes since its creation in 1991 ntl has diversified from its
core television and radio broadcasting business to enter into the cable and
telecommunications sectors

   although ccuk and ntl are direct competitors they have reciprocal rights
to the use of each others sites for broadcast transmission usage in order to
enable each of them to achieve the necessary countrywide coverage this
relationship is formalized by the sitesharing agreement entered into in 1991
the time at which ntl was privatized

   ntl also offers site rental on approximately 1000 of its sites some of
which are managed on behalf of third parties like ccuk ntl offers a full
range of siterelated services to its customers including installation and
maintenance

   four uk mobile operators own site infrastructure and lease space to other
users their openness to sharing with direct competitors varies by operator
bt cellnet and vodafone have agreed to cut site costs by jointly developing
and acquiring sites in the scottish highlands british telecom and cable 
wireless communications are both major site sharing customers but also compete
by leasing their own sites to third parties british telecoms position in the
market is even larger when considered in combination with its interest in bt
cellnet

   ccuk faces competition from a large number of companies in the provision of
network services the companies include ntl spectrasite specialty
consultants and equipment manufacturers such as nortel and ericsson

regulatory matters

 united states

  federal regulations

   both the fcc and faa regulate towers used for wireless communications
transmitters and receivers such regulations control the siting and marking of
towers and may depending on the characteristics of particular towers require
the registration of tower facilities and the issuance of determinations of no
hazard wireless communications devices operating on towers are separately
regulated and independently licensed based upon the particular frequency used
in addition the fcc and the faa have developed standards to consider
proposals for new or modified antenna structures based upon the height and
location including proximity to airports of proposed antenna structures
proposals to construct or to modify existing antenna structures above certain
heights are reviewed by the faa to ensure the structure will not present a
hazard to aviation which determination may be conditioned upon compliance
with lighting and marking requirements the fcc will not license the operation
of communications devices on towers unless the tower complies with the faa
rules and is registered with the fcc if necessary tower owners may also bear
the responsibility of notifying the faa of any tower lighting outage the
company generally indemnifies its customers against any failure to comply with
applicable regulatory standards failure to comply with the applicable
requirements may lead to civil penalties

  local regulations

   local regulations include

     city and other local ordinances

     zoning restrictions and

     restrictive covenants imposed by community developers

   these regulations vary greatly but typically require tower owners to
obtain approval from local officials or community standards organizations
prior to tower construction local zoning authorities generally have been
hostile to construction of new transmission towers in their communities
because of the height and visibility of the towers

  other regulations

   we hold through certain of our subsidiaries licenses for radio
transmission facilities granted by the fcc including licenses for common
carrier microwave and commercial mobile radio services including specialized
mobile radio and paging facilities as well as private mobile radio services
including industrialbusiness radio

                                      18

facilities which are subject to additional regulation by the fcc we are
required to obtain the fccs approval prior to the transfer of control of any
of our fcc licenses

 united kingdom

   telecommunications systems and equipment used for the transmission of
signals over radio frequencies have to be licensed in the united kingdom
these licenses are issued on behalf of the british government by the secretary
of state for trade and industry under the telecommunications act 1984 and the
wireless telegraphy acts 1949 1968 and 1998 ccuk has a number of such
licenses under which it runs the telecommunications distribution and
transmission systems which are necessary for the provision of its transmission
services

  licenses under the telecommunications act 1984

   ccuk has the following three licenses under the telecommunications act
1984

   transmission license the transmission license is a renewable license to
run telecommunications systems for the transmission via wireless telegraphy a
type of data transmissions technique of broadcasting services this license
is for a period of at least 25 years from january 23 1997 and is ccuks
principal license its main provisions include

     a price control condition covering the provision of all analog radio
      and television transmission services to the bbc under the bbc analog
      transmission agreement establishing an initial price at approximately
      pounds44 million for regulated elements of the services provided by
      ccuk under the bbc analog transmission agreement in the year ended
      march 31 1997 with an increase cap which is 1 below the rate of
      increase in the retail price index over the previous calendar year the
      current price control condition applies until march 31 2006

     a change of control provision which requires notification of
      acquisitions of interest in ccuk of more than 20 by a public
      telecommunications operator or any channel 3 or channel 5 licensee
      which acquisitions entitle the secretary of state to revoke the
      license

     a site sharing requirement requiring ccuk to provide space on its
      towers to analog and digital broadcast transmission operators and
      including a power for the director general of telecommunications
      oftel as the regulator to determine prices if there is failure
      between the site owner and the prospective site sharer to agree to a
      price

     a fair trading provision enabling oftel to act against anticompetitive
      behavior by the licensee

     a prohibition on undue preference or discrimination in the provision of
      the services it is required to provide third parties under the
      transmission license

   a complaint made by classic fm and ntl in respect of certain charges
imposed previously by the bbc under the site sharing agreement for ntls use
of bbc radio antennas for its classic fm customer was the subject of judicial
review proceedings to ascertain the right of oftel to intervene and determine
the appropriate rate under the applicable rate mechanism in ccuks
transmission license ccuk was the applicant in those proceedings financial
provision was made in ccuks accounts in respect of the proceedings and the
dispute in general on june 22 2000 the matter was settled prior to any
judicial review taking place settlement was by written agreement and the
proceedings were abandoned the settlement was made within the financial
provision made in ccuks accounts in respect of the settlement

   ccuk is discussing with oftel certain amendments to ccuks
telecommunications act transmission license to ensure that the price control
condition accommodates the provision by ccuk of additional contractually
agreed upon services to the bbc in return for additional agreed upon payments
see businessrisk factorsextensive regulations which could change at any
time and which we could fail to comply with regulate our business

                                      19
page

   the secretary of state has designated the transmission license a public
telecommunications operator license in order to reserve to himself certain
emergency powers for the protection of national security this designation is
however limited to this objective ccuk does not have a full uk public
telecommunications license and does not require one for its current
activities the department of trade and industry has nevertheless indicated
that it would be willing to issue ccuk such a license as a result ccuk would
gain wider powers to provide services to nonlicense holding third parties
including public switched voice telephony and satellite uplink and would grant
ccuk powers to build out its network over public property socalled code
powers

   general telecom license the general telecom license is a general license
to run telecommunications systems and authorizes ccuk to run all the necessary
telecommunications systems to convey messages to its transmitter sites eg
via leased circuits or using its own microwave links the license does not
cover the provision of public switched telephony networks which would require
a public telecommunications license as described above

   satellite license the satellite license is a license to run
telecommunications systems for the provision of satellite telecommunication
services and allows the conveyance via satellite of messages including data
and radio broadcasting the license excludes television broadcasting direct to
the home via satellite although distribution via satellite of television
broadcasting services which are to be transmitted terrestrially is permitted

  licenses under the wireless telegraphy acts 1949 1968 and 1998

   ccuk has a number of licenses under the wireless telegraphy acts 1949 1968
and 1998 authorizing the use of radio equipment for the provision of certain
services over allocated radio frequencies including

     a broadcasting services license in relation to the transmission
      services provided to the bbc virgin radio and talk radio

     a fixed pointtopoint radio links license

     two bandwidth test and development licenses and

     digital terrestrial television test and development licenses

   all the existing licenses under the wireless telegraphy acts 1949 1968 and
1998 have to be renewed annually with the payment of a significant fee the
bbc virgin radio and talk radio have each contracted to pay their portion of
these fees ondigital is obligated under the ondigital digital transmission
contract to pay most of their portion of these fees

australia

  federal regulation

   carrier licenses and nominated carrier declarations issued under the
federal telecommunications act 1997 authorize the use of network units for the
supply of telecommunications services to the public the definition of
network units includes line links and base stations used for wireless
telephony services but does not include tower infrastructure accordingly
ccal as a tower owner and operator does not require a carrier license
similarly because ccal does not own any transmitters or spectrum it does not
currently require any apparatus or spectrum licenses issued under the federal
radiocommunications act 1992

   carriers have a statutory obligation to provide other carriers with access
to tower facilities and sites and if there is a dispute including as to
pricing the matter may be referred to the australian competition and
consumer commission for resolution as a noncarrier ccal is not currently
subject to this regime and negotiates site access on a commercial basis

   while the telecommunications act 1997 grants certain exemptions from
planning laws for the installation to low impact facilities towers are
expressly excluded from the definition of low impact facilities

                                      20
page

accordingly in connection with the construction of new tower facilities ccal
is subject to state and local planning laws which vary on a site by site
basis for a limited number of sites ccal is also required to install
aircraft warning lighting in compliance with federal aviation regulations

  local regulations

   in australia there are various local state and territory laws and
regulations which relate to among other things

     town planning and zoning restrictions

     standards applicable to the design and construction of structures and
      facilities

     approval for the construction or alteration of a structure or facility

     the protection of the environment and

     city and other local government ordinances

   as in the united states these laws vary greatly but typically require
tower owners to obtain approval from government bodies prior to tower
construction and for ongoing compliance with environmental laws

environmental matters

   our operations are subject to foreign federal state and local laws and
regulations relating to the management use storage disposal emission and
remediation of and exposure to hazardous and nonhazardous substances
materials and wastes as an owner and operator of real property we are
subject to certain environmental laws that impose strict jointandseveral
liability for the cleanup of onsite or offsite contamination relating to
existing or historical operations and we also could be subject to personal
injury or property damage claims relating to such contamination we are
potentially subject to environmental and cleanup liabilities in the united
states the united kingdom and australia

   we are also subject to regulations and guidelines that impose a variety of
operational requirements relating to radio frequency emissions the potential
connection between radio frequency emissions and certain negative health
effects including some forms of cancer has been the subject of substantial
study by the scientific community in recent years to date the results of
these studies have been inconclusive in addition to general observance of
industry guidelines and health and safety legislation requirements we have
also established detailed operating procedures designed to reduce employee
exposures to radio frequency emissions and are continually evaluating certain
of our towers and transmission equipment to determine whether radio frequency
emission reductions are economically possible and feasible

   we believe that we are in substantial compliance with all applicable
environmental laws nevertheless there can be no assurance that the costs of
compliance with existing or future environmental laws will not have a material
adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition

recent and agreed to transactions

   we have recently completed or entered into agreements for the transactions
described below completion of these transactions has and will continue to
result in a significant increase in the size of our operations and the number
of towers that we own and manage plus a need for capital we cannot guarantee
that we will consummate any of the agreed to transactions on the terms
currently contemplated or at all the descriptions of the terms of these
transactions set forth below are summaries and do not contain all of the terms
and conditions contained in the complete text of the relevant agreements

risk factors

   you should carefully consider the risks described below as well as the
other information contained in this document when evaluating your investment
in our securities

failure to properly manage our growthif we are unable to successfully
integrate acquired operations or manage our existing operations as we grow
our business will be adversely affected and we may not be able to continue
our current business strategy

   we cannot guarantee that we will be able to successfully integrate acquired
businesses and assets into our business or implement our growth plans without
delay if we fail to do so it could have a material adverse effect

                                      23
page

on our financial condition and results of operations we have grown
significantly over the past two years through acquisitions and such growth
continues to be an important part of our business plan the addition of over
10000 towers to our operations over the past two years has and will continue
to increase our current business considerably and adds significant operational
complexities successful integration of these transactions will depend
primarily on our ability to manage these combined operations and to integrate
new management and employees with and into our existing operations for the
twelve months ended december 31 2000 our net loss increased from 968
million to 2048 million an increase of 1116 as a result of our expanded
business operations and the financing thereof including an 835 increase in
depreciation and amortization and a 1176 increase in interest expense as
compared to the twelve months ended december 31 1999 we expect that such net
losses at least in the near term will continue to exceed those of comparable
prioryear periods as a result of our growth and the financing thereof

   implementation of our acquisition strategy may impose significant strains
on our management operating systems and financial resources we regularly
evaluate potential acquisition and joint venture opportunities and are
currently evaluating potential transactions that could involve substantial
expenditures possibly in the near term if we fail to manage our growth or
encounter unexpected difficulties during expansion it could have a material
adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations the
pursuit and integration of acquisitions and joint venture opportunities will
require substantial attention from our senior management which will limit the
amount of time they are able to devote to our existing operations

substantial level of indebtednessour substantial level of indebtedness could
adversely affect our ability to react to changes in our business we may also
be limited in our ability to use debt to fund future capital needs

   we have a substantial amount of indebtedness the following chart sets
forth certain important credit information and is presented as of december 31
2000 both on an actual basis as well as on a pro forma basis giving effect to
our common stock offering on january 17 2001 of 13445200 shares

   in addition our earnings for the twelve months ended december 31 2000
were insufficient to cover fixed charges by 2023 million

   as a result of our substantial indebtedness

     we could be more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry
      conditions

     we may find it more difficult to obtain additional financing to fund
      future working capital capital expenditures and other general
      corporate requirements

     we will be required to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow
      from operations to the payment of principal and interest on our debt
      reducing the available cash flow to fund other projects

     we may have limited flexibility in planning for or reacting to
      changes in our business and in the industry and

     we will have a competitive disadvantage relative to other companies
      with less debt in our industry

   we cannot guarantee that we will be able to generate enough cash flow from
operations or that we will be able to obtain enough capital to service our
debt pay our obligations under our convertible preferred stock or fund our
planned capital expenditures in addition we may need to refinance some or
all of our indebtedness on or before maturity we cannot guarantee however
that we will be able to refinance our indebtedness on commercially reasonable
terms or at all

as a holding company we require dividends from subsidiaries to meet cash
requirements or pay dividendsif our subsidiaries are unable to dividend cash
to us when we need it we may be unable to pay dividends or satisfy our
obligations including interest and principal payments under our debt
instruments

   crown castle international corp or ccic is a holding company with no
business operations of its own ccics only significant asset is the
outstanding capital stock of its subsidiaries ccic conducts all of its
business operations through its subsidiaries accordingly ccics only source
of cash to pay dividends or make other distributions on its capital stock or
to pay interest and principal on its outstanding indebtedness is distributions
relating to its ownership interest in its subsidiaries from the net earnings
and cash flow generated by such subsidiaries we currently expect that the
earnings and cash flow of ccics subsidiaries will be retained and used by
such subsidiaries in their operations including the service of their
respective debt obligations even if we did determine to make a distribution
in respect of the capital stock of ccics subsidiaries there can be no
assurance that ccics subsidiaries will generate sufficient cash flow to pay
or distribute such a dividend or funds or that applicable state law and
contractual restrictions including negative covenants contained in the debt
instruments of such subsidiaries would permit such dividends distributions
or payments furthermore the terms of our credit facilities place
restrictions on our principal subsidiaries ability to pay dividends or to
make distributions and in any event such dividends or distributions may only
be paid if no default has occurred under the applicable instrument moreover
ccics subsidiaries are permitted under the terms of their existing debt
instruments to incur additional indebtedness that may restrict or prohibit the
making of distributions the payment of dividends or the making of loans by
such subsidiaries to ccic see businessrisk factorssubstantial level of
indebtedness and businessrisk factorsability to service debt

ability to service debtto service our indebtedness we will require a
significant amount of cash from our subsidiaries an inability to access our
subsidiaries cash flow may lead to an acceleration of our indebtedness
including our notes currently the instruments governing our subsidiaries
indebtedness do not allow sufficient funds to be distributed to ccic to
service its indebtedness

   if ccic is unable to refinance its subsidiary debt or renegotiate the terms
of such debt ccic may not be able to meet its debt service requirements
including interest payments on our notes in the future our 9 senior notes
our 9 12 senior notes and our 10 34 senior notes require annual cash
interest payments of approximately 162 million 119 million and 538
million respectively prior to november 15 2002 may 15 2004 and august 1
2004 the interest expense on our 10 58 discount notes our 10 38 discount
notes and our 11 14 discount notes respectively will be comprised solely
of the amortization of original issue discount thereafter the 10 58
discount notes the 10 38 discount notes and the 11 14 discount notes will
require annual cash interest payments of approximately 267 million 519
million and 293 million respectively prior to december 15 2003 we do not
expect to pay cash dividends on our exchangeable preferred stock or if
issued cash interest on the exchange debentures thereafter assuming all
dividends or interest have been paidinkind our exchangeable preferred stock
or if issued the exchange debentures will require annual cash dividend or
interest payments of approximately 478 million annual cash interest
payments on the ccuk bonds are pounds1125 million 168 million in
addition our various credit facilities will require periodic interest
payments on amounts borrowed thereunder

restrictive debt covenantsthe terms of our debt instruments limit our
ability to take a number of actions that our management might otherwise
believe to be in our best interests in addition if we fail to comply with
our covenants our debt could be accelerated

   currently we have debt instruments in place that restrict our ability to
incur more indebtedness pay dividends create liens sell assets and engage
in certain mergers and acquisitions our subsidiaries under their debt
instruments are also required to maintain specific financial ratios our
ability to comply with the restrictions of these instruments and to satisfy
our debt obligations will depend on our future operating performance if we
fail to comply with the debt restrictions we will be in default under those
instruments which in some cases would cause the maturity of substantially all
of our longterm indebtedness to be accelerated

we require significant capital to fund our operations and make acquisitions
if we are unable to raise capital in the future we will be unable to achieve
our currently contemplated business strategy and may not be able to fund our
operations

   we will require substantial capital as we increase the number of towers we
own and manage by partnering with wireless carriers by pursuing opportunities
to build new towers or buildtosuit opportunities for wireless carriers and
by pursuing other tower acquisition opportunities we will also require
substantial capital to acquire existing transmission networks globally as
opportunities arise if we are unable to raise capital when our needs arise
we will be unable to pursue our current business strategy and may not be able
to fund our operations

   to fund the execution of our business strategy including the construction
of new towers that we have agreed to build we expect to use the remaining net
proceeds of our recent offerings and borrowings available under our credit
facilities we will have additional cash needs to fund our operations and
acquisitions in the future we may also have additional cash needs in the near
term if additional tower acquisitions or buildtosuit opportunities arise
some of the opportunities that we are currently pursuing could require
significant additional capital if we do not otherwise have cash available or
borrowings under our credit facilities have otherwise been utilized when our
cash need arises we would be forced to seek additional debt or equity
financing or to forego the opportunity in the event we determine to seek
additional debt or equity financing there can be no assurance that any such
financing will be available on commercially acceptable terms or at all or
permitted by the terms of our existing indebtedness

we may not be able to construct or acquire new towers at the pace and in the
locations that we desireif we are unable to do so we may not be able to
satisfy our current agreements to build new towers and we may have difficulty
finding tenants to lease space on our new towers

   our growth strategy depends in part on our ability to construct and operate
towers in conjunction with expansion by wireless carriers if we are unable to
build new towers when wireless carriers require them or we are unable to
build new towers where we believe the best opportunity to add tenants exists
we could fail to meet our contractual obligations under buildtosuit
agreements and we could lose opportunities to lease space on our towers

   during 2000 we completed construction of 1178 towers we currently have
plans to commence construction on approximately 1500 additional towers during
2001 our ability to construct these new towers could be affected by a number
of factors beyond our control including

     zoning and local permitting requirements and national regulatory
      approvals

     availability of construction equipment and skilled construction
      personnel and

     bad weather conditions

   in addition as the concern over tower proliferation has grown in recent
years certain communities have placed restrictions on new tower construction
or have delayed granting permits required for construction you should
consider that

     the barriers to new construction may prevent us from building towers
      where we want

     we may not be able to complete the number of towers planned for
      construction in accordance with the requirements of our customers and

     we cannot guarantee that there will be a significant need for the
      construction of new towers once the wireless carriers complete their
      tower networks

   all of the above factors could affect both our domestic and international
operations in addition competition laws could prevent us from acquiring or
constructing towers or tower networks in certain geographical areas

our business depends on the demand for wireless communicationswe will be
adversely affected by any slowdown in the growth of or reduction in demand
for wireless communications

   demand for our site rentals depends on demand for communication sites from
wireless carriers which in turn depends on the demand for wireless
services the demand for our sites depends on many factors which we cannot
control including

     the level of demand for wireless services generally

     the financial condition and access to capital of wireless carriers

     the strategy of carriers relating to owning or leasing communication
      sites

     changes in telecommunications regulations and

     general economic conditions

   a slowdown in the growth of or reduction in demand in a particular
wireless segment could adversely affect the demand for communication sites
moreover wireless carriers often operate with substantial indebtedness and
financial problems for our customers could result in accounts receivable going
uncollected the loss of a customer and associated lease revenue or a
reduced ability of these customers to finance expansion activities finally
advances in technology such as the development of new satellite and antenna
systems could reduce the need for landbased or terrestrial transmission
networks the occurrence of any of these factors could have a material adverse
effect on our financial condition and results of operations

variability in demand for network services may reduce the predictability of
our resultsour network services business has historically experienced
significant volatility in demand as a result the operating results of our
network services business for any particular period may vary significantly and
should not be considered as necessarily being indicative of longerterm
results

   demand for our network services fluctuates from period to period and within
periods these fluctuations are caused by a number of factors including

     the timing of customers capital expenditures

     annual budgetary considerations of customers

     the rate and volume of wireless carriers tower buildouts

     timing of existing customer contracts and

     general economic conditions

   while demand for our network services fluctuates we must incur certain
costs such as maintaining a staff of network services employees in
anticipation of future contracts even when there may be no current business
furthermore as wireless carriers complete their buildouts the need for the
construction of new towers and the demand for our network services could
decrease significantly and could result in fluctuations and possibly
significant declines in our operating performance

we operate our business in an increasingly competitive industry and many of
our competitors have significantly more resourcesas a result of this
competition we may find it more difficult to achieve favorable lease rates on
our towers and we may be forced to pay more for future tower acquisitions

   we face competition for site rental customers from various sources
including

     other large independent tower owners

     wireless carriers that own and operate their own towers and lease
      antenna space to other carriers

                                      27
page

     site development companies that acquire antenna space on existing
      towers for wireless carriers and manage new tower construction and

     traditional local independent tower operators

   wireless carriers that own and operate their own tower portfolios generally
are substantially larger and have greater financial resources than we have
competition for tenants on towers could adversely affect lease rates and
service income

   in addition competition for the acquisition of towers is intense and we
expect it to continue to grow we not only compete against other independent
tower owners and operators but also against wireless carriers broadcasters
and site developers as competition consolidates we may be faced with fewer
acquisition opportunities as well as higher acquisition prices while we
regularly explore acquisition opportunities we cannot guarantee that we will
be able to identify suitable towers to acquire in the future

a substantial portion of our revenues is dependent upon agreements with the
bbc ntl verizon cingular and powertel

   if we were to lose our contracts with the bbc or our site sharing agreement
with ntl we would likely lose a substantial portion of our revenues the bbc
accounted for approximately 148 of our revenues for the twelvemonth period
ended december 31 2000

   our broadcast business is substantially dependent on our contracts with the
bbc we cannot guarantee that the bbc will renew our contracts or that they
will not attempt to negotiate terms that are not as favorable to us as those
in place now if we were to lose these bbc contracts our business results of
operations and financial condition would be materially adversely affected the
initial term of our analog transmission contract with the bbc will expire on
march 31 2007 and our digital transmission contract with the bbc expires on
october 31 2010 in addition our digital transmission contract with the bbc
may be terminated by the bbc after five years if the bbcs board of governors
does not believe that digital television in the united kingdom has enough
viewers

   a substantial portion of our uk broadcast transmission operations is
conducted using sites owned by ntl our principal broadcast competitor in the
united kingdom ntl also utilizes our sites for their broadcast operations
this site sharing arrangement with ntl may be terminated on december 31 2015
or any 10year anniversary of that date with five years prior notice by
either us or ntl and may be terminated sooner if there is a continuing breach
of the agreement we cannot guarantee that this agreement will not be
terminated which could have a material adverse effect on our business
results of operations and financial condition

   in addition a substantial portion of our revenues are received from a few
major wireless carriers particularly carriers that have transferred their
tower assets to us we cannot guarantee that the lease or management service
agreements with such carriers will not be terminated or that these carriers
will renew such agreements

extensive regulations which could change at any time and with which we could
fail to comply regulate our businessif we fail to comply with applicable
regulations we could be fined or even lose our right to conduct some of our
business

   a variety of foreign federal state and local regulations apply to our
business failure to comply with applicable requirements may lead to civil
penalties or require us to assume costly indemnification obligations or breach
contractual provisions we cannot guarantee that existing regulatory policies
will not adversely affect the timing or cost of new tower construction or that
additional regulations will not be adopted which increase delays or result in
additional costs these factors could have a material adverse effect on our
financial condition and results of operations

                                      28

   since we signed our analog transmission contract with the bbc the bbc has
increased its service requirements to include 24hour broadcasting on our
transmission network for the bbcs two national television services and a
requirement for us to add a number of additional analog stations and service
enhancements to existing analog stations as of december 31 2000 the bbc has
agreed to increases of approximately pounds49 million approximately 73
million per year in the charges payable by the bbc to us for these service
enhancements these additional charges may require a revision amendment to
that part of ccuks transmission telecommunications license dealing with price
regulation of analog broadcasting services to the bbc we are in discussions
with the bbc and oftel the relevant regulatory authority in the united
kingdom regarding wording which will modify the license regulatory provisions
to take into account these agreed additional payments there can be no
assurances that such modification will be achieved as a result of these
discussions with oftel

if we fail to complete any or all of our previously agreedto transactions we
will not recognize all of the benefits of such transactions

   if one or more of our previously agreedto transactions is not fully
completed or is completed on significantly different terms than those
currently contemplated it could substantially affect the implementation of
our business strategy as a result our future site rental revenue would be
adversely affected the agreements relating to these agreedto transactions
contain many conditions that must be satisfied before we can consummate such
agreedto transactions in addition each of the agreements relating to these
agreedto transactions includes provisions that could result in our purchasing
or building fewer towers pursuant to such agreements

emissions from our antennas may create health riskswe could suffer from
future claims if the radio frequency emissions from equipment on our towers is
demonstrated to cause negative health effects

   the government imposes requirements and other guidelines on our towers
relating to radio frequency emissions the potential connection between radio
frequency emissions and certain negative health effects including some forms
of cancer has been the subject of substantial study by the scientific
community in recent years to date the results of these studies have been
inconclusive we cannot guarantee that claims relating to radio frequency
emissions will not arise in the future

our international operations expose us to changes in foreign currency exchange
ratesif we fail to properly match or hedge the currencies in which we
conduct business we could suffer losses as a result of changes in currency
exchange rates

   we conduct business in countries outside the united states which exposes
us to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates we also intend to
expand our international operations in the future for the twelve months ended
december 31 2000 approximately 346 of our consolidated revenues originated
outside the united states all of which were denominated in currencies other
than us dollars principally pounds sterling and australian dollars we have
not historically engaged in significant hedging activities relating to our
nonus dollar operations and we could suffer future losses as a result of
changes in currency exchange rates

we are heavily dependent on our senior managementif we lose members of our
senior management we may not be able to find appropriate replacements on a
timely basis and our business could be adversely affected

   our existing operations and continued future development depend to a
significant extent upon the performance and active participation of certain
key individuals as employees including our chief executive officer and our
president we cannot guarantee that we will be successful in retaining the
services of these or other key personnel none of our executives have signed
noncompetition agreements if we were to lose any of these individuals we may
not be able to find appropriate replacements on a timely basis and our
financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely
affected

effects that conflict with the interests of our stockholderscertain
provisions of our certificate of incorporation bylaws and operative

of us even if such a change in control would be beneficial to you

   we have a number of antitakeover devices in place that will hinder

overview

   the continued growth of our business depends substantially on the condition
of the wireless communications and broadcast industries we believe that the
demand for communications sites will continue to grow and expect that due to
increased competition wireless carriers will continue to seek operating and
capital efficiencies by 1 outsourcing certain network services and the
buildout and operation of new and existing

                                      34
page

infrastructure and 2 planning to use a tower site as a common location or
colocating for the placement of their antennas and transmission equipment
alongside the equipment of other communications providers in addition we
believe that more wireless carriers will seek to sell their wireless
communications infrastructure to or establish joint ventures with
experienced infrastructure providers such as the company that have the
ability to manage networks

   further we believe that wireless carriers and broadcasters will continue
to seek to outsource the operation of their towers and eventually their
transmission networks including the transmission of their signals management
believes that our ability to manage towers and transmission networks and our
proven track record of providing services addressing all aspects of signaling
systems from the originating station to the terminating receiver or endto
end services to the wireless communications and broadcasting industries
position our company to capture such business

   the willingness of wireless carriers to utilize our infrastructure and
related services is affected by numerous factors including

     consumer demand for wireless services

     interest rates

     cost of capital

     availability of capital to wireless carriers

     tax policies

     willingness to colocate equipment

     local restrictions on the proliferation of towers

     cost of building towers and

     technological changes affecting the number of communications sites
      needed to provide wireless communications services to a given
      geographic area

   our revenues that are derived from the provision of transmission services
to the broadcasting industry will be affected by

     the timing of the rollout of digital television broadcasts from tower
      mounted antenna systems or digital terrestrial television
      broadcasts in the united kingdom as well as in the united states and
      other countries around the world

     consumer demand for digital terrestrial broadcasting

     interest rates

     cost of capital

     zoning restrictions on towers and

     the cost of building towers

   as an important part of our business strategy we will seek

  1 to maximize utilization of our tower capacity

  2 to utilize the expertise of us uk and australian personnel to
      capture global growth opportunities

  3 to partner with wireless carriers to assume ownership of their existing
      towers

  4 to build new towers for wireless carriers and

  5 to acquire existing broadcast transmission networks globally as
      opportunities arise

                                      35

results of operations

   our primary sources of revenues are from

  1 renting antenna space on towers and rooftops sites

  2 providing analog and digital broadcast transmission services and

  3 providing network services

   site rental revenues in the us are received primarily from wireless
communications companies including those operating in the following
categories of wireless communications

     microwave

     cellular

     personal communications services a digital service operating at a
      higher frequency range than cellular

     paging

     specialized mobile radio a service operating in the frequency range
      used for twoway radio communication by public safety trucking
      companies and other dispatch service users and

     enhanced specialized mobile radio a service operating in the frequency
      range typically used for digital communications

site rental revenues are generally recognized on a monthly basis under lease
agreements which typically have original terms of five years with three or
four optional renewal periods of five years each

   broadcast transmission services revenues in the uk are received for both
analog and digital transmission services monthly analog transmission revenues
are principally received from the bbc under a contract with an initial 10year
term through march 31 2007 digital transmission services revenues from the
bbc and ondigital are recognized under contracts with initial terms of 12
years through november 15 2010 monthly revenues from these digital
transmission contracts increase over time as the network rollout progresses
see item 1 businessuk operationssignificant contracts

   site rental revenues in the uk are received from other broadcast
transmission service providers primarily ntl and wireless communications
companies including all four uk cellular operators bt cellnet vodafone
one 2 one and orange site rental revenues are generally recognized on a
monthly basis under lease agreements with original terms of three to 12 years
such lease agreements generally require annual payments in advance and
include rental rate adjustment provisions between one and three years from the
commencement of the lease site rental revenues are expected to become an
increasing portion of ccuks total uk revenue base and we believe that the
demand for site rental from communication service providers will increase in
line with the expected growth of these communication services in the united
kingdom

   network services revenues in the us consist of revenues from

  1 network design and site selection

  2 site acquisition

  3 site development and construction

  4 antenna installation and

  5 other services

network services revenues are received primarily from wireless communications
companies network services revenues in the us are recognized under service
contracts which provide for billings on either a fixed price

basis or a time and materials basis demand for our network services
fluctuates from period to period and within periods see item 1 business
risk factorsvariability in demand for network services may reduce the
predictability of our results consequently the operating results of our
network services businesses for any particular period may vary significantly
and should not be considered as indicative of longerterm results we also
derive revenues from the ownership and operation of microwave radio and
specialized mobile radio networks in puerto rico where we own radio wave
spectrum in the 2000 mhz and 6000 mhz range for microwave radio and the
800 mhz range for specialized mobile radio these revenues are generally
recognized under monthly management or service agreements

   network services revenues in the uk consist of 1 network design and
site selection site acquisition site development and antenna installation
and 2 site management and other services network design and development and
related services are provided to

  1 a number of broadcasting and related organizations both in the united
      kingdom and other countries

  2 all four uk cellular operators and

  3 a number of other wireless communications companies including dolphin
      and highway one

these services are usually subject to a competitive bid although a
significant proportion result from an operator coming onto an existing ccuk
site revenues from such services are recognized on either a fixed price or a
time and materials basis site management and other services consisting of
both network monitoring and equipment maintenance are carried out in the
united kingdom for a number of emergency service organizations ccuk receives
revenues for such services under contracts with original terms of between
three and five years such contracts provide fixed prices for network
monitoring and variable pricing dependent on the level of equipment
maintenance carried out in a given period

   costs of operations for site rental in the us primarily consist of

       land leases

       repairs and maintenance

       utilities

       insurance

       property taxes

       monitoring costs and

       in the case of managed sites rental payments

for any given tower such costs are relatively fixed over a monthly or an
annual time period as such operating costs for owned towers do not generally
increase significantly as additional customers are added however rental
expenses at certain managed towers increase as additional customer antennas
are added resulting in higher incremental revenues but lower incremental
margins than on owned towers

   costs of operations for broadcast transmission services in the uk consist
primarily of employee compensation and related benefits costs utilities
rental payments under the sitesharing agreement with ntl circuit costs and
repairs and maintenance on both transmission equipment and structures site
rental operating costs in the uk consist primarily of employee compensation
and related benefits costs utilities and repairs and maintenance the
majority of such costs are relatively fixed in nature with increases in
revenue from new installations on existing sites generally being achieved
without a corresponding increase in costs

   costs of operations for network services consist primarily of employee
compensation and related benefits costs subcontractor services consulting
fees and other onsite construction and materials costs we incur these
network services costs 1 to support our internal operations including
maintenance of our owned towers and 2 to maintain the employees necessary
to provide endtoend services to third parties regardless of the level of

                                      37
page

such business at any time we believe that our experienced staff enables us to
provide the type of endtoend services that enhance our ability to acquire
access to the infrastructure of wireless carriers and to attract significant
buildtosuit contracts

   general and administrative expenses consist primarily of

     employee compensation training recruitment and related benefits
      costs

     advertising

     professional and consulting fees

     office rent and related expenses and

     travel costs

    corporate development expenses represent costs incurred in connection with
 acquisitions and development of new business initiatives these expenses
 consist primarily of

     allocated compensation and external professional fees

     benefits and

liquidity and capital resources

   our business strategy contemplates substantial capital expenditures

  1 in connection with the expansion of our tower portfolios by partnering
      with wireless carriers to assume ownership or control of their existing
      towers by pursuing buildtosuit opportunities and by pursuing other
      tower acquisition opportunities and

  2 to acquire existing transmission networks globally as opportunities
      arise

   since its inception ccic has generally funded its activities other than
acquisitions and investments through excess proceeds from contributions of
equity capital and cash provided by operations ccic has financed acquisitions
and investments with the proceeds from equity contributions borrowings under
our senior credit facilities issuances of debt securities and the issuance of
promissory notes to sellers since its inception ccuk has generally funded
its activities other than the acquisition of the bbc home service
transmission business through cash provided by operations and borrowings
under ccuks credit facility ccuk financed the acquisition of the bbc home
service transmission business with the proceeds from equity contributions and
the issuance of the ccuk bonds

   for the years ended december 31 1998 1999 and 2000 our net cash provided
by operating activities was 450 million 926 million and 1655 million

borrowings will be determined based on the current financial performance as
defined of those subsidiaries assets in addition up to 250 million of

of credit on march 15 2000 we used 834 million in borrowings under the
2000 credit facility to repay outstanding borrowings and accrued interest
under the crown communication senior credit facility the net proceeds from
3166 million in additional borrowings were used to fund a portion of the
purchase price for the gte joint venture and for general corporate purposes

2000 of which 109 million were for ccic 4224 million were for ccusa

approximately 2300 million and approximately

                                      44

500 towers in the united kingdom at a cost of approximately 1000 million we
also expect to spend approximately 1200 million in the united states to
improve the structural capacity of our domestic towers

   in addition to capital expenditures in connection with buildtosuits we
have applied a significant amount of capital to finance the remaining cash
portion of the consideration paid in connection with the recent transactions

have issued approximately 91 million shares of our common stock and paid
bellsouth 4381 million in cash

   in connection with the bellsouth dcs transaction through december 2000 we
have paid bellsouth dcs 3015 million in cash

   on november 7 1999 we entered into an agreement with gte now part of
verizon communications to form a joint venture to own and operate a
significant majority of gtes towers the agreement contemplated that the
transaction would be completed in multiple closings during 2000 on january
31 2000 the formation of the joint venture took place in connection with the
first such closing of towers during the course of the multiple closings 1
we contributed an aggregate of approximately 8153 million of which
approximately 945 million was in shares of our common stock with the
balance in cash in exchange for a majority ownership interest in the joint
venture and 2 gte contributed approximately 2300 towers in exchange for
cash distributions aggregating approximately 6958 million from the joint
venture and a minority ownership interest in the joint venture upon
dissolution of the joint venture gte will receive 1 the 51 million shares
of our common stock contributed to the joint venture and 2 a payment equal
to approximately 111 of the fair market value of the joint ventures other
net assets we will then receive the remaining assets and liabilities of the
joint venture we have accounted for our investment in the gte joint venture
as a purchase of tower assets and have included the joint ventures results
of operations and cash flows in our consolidated financial statements for
periods subsequent to formation

   upon entering into the agreement with gte we placed 500 million into an
escrow account at the april 3 2000 closing for the gte joint venture the
funds in the escrow account were used to pay 500 million of our cash
contribution a portion of the remaining cash contribution for this closing
was financed with the net proceeds from borrowings under the term loans due
2011 as discussed above

   in addition to the approximately 2300 towers contributed pursuant to the
formation agreement gte had the right to contribute certain additional towers
to the gte joint venture including towers acquired by gte from ameritech
corp ameritech on terms substantially similar to those in the formation
agreement in april 2000 we agreed with gte that the ameritech towers would
be contributed to the joint venture in august and september 2000 we
contributed 1816 million in cash and gte contributed 497 of the ameritech
towers in exchange for a cash distribution of 1816 million from the joint
venture

   in march 2000 ccal our 667 owned subsidiary entered into an agreement
to purchase approximately 700 towers in australia from cable  wireless optus
the total purchase price for the towers will be approximately 1350 million
in cash australian 2200 million we have accounted for our investment in
ccal as a purchase of tower assets and have included ccals results of
operations and cash flows in our consolidated financial statements for periods
subsequent to the purchase date on april 3 2000 the first closing took
place for ccal we contributed 908 million in cash australian 1475
million to ccal the largest portion of this amount along with a capital
contribution from ccals minority shareholder was used to pay 1035 million
australian 1681 million to optus during the remainder of 2000 ccal made
additional payments to optus amounting to 154 million australian 275
million

   we expect that the completion of the recent transactions and the execution
of our new tower build or buildtosuit program will have a material impact
on our liquidity we expect that once integrated these transactions will have
a positive impact on liquidity but will require some period of time to offset
the initial adverse impact

                                      45
page

on liquidity in addition we believe that as new towers become operational
and we begin to add tenants they should result in a longterm increase in
liquidity

   to fund the execution of our business strategy including the recent
transactions described above and the construction of new towers that we have
agreed to build we expect to use the net proceeds of our recent offerings and
borrowings available under our us and uk credit facilities we will have
additional cash needs to fund our operations in the future we may also have
additional cash needs in the future if additional tower acquisitions or build
tosuit opportunities arise some of the opportunities that we are currently
pursuing could require significant additional capital if we do not otherwise
have cash available or borrowings under our credit facilities have otherwise
been utilized when our cash need arises we would be forced to seek
additional debt or equity financing or to forego the opportunity in the event
we determine to seek additional debt or equity financing there can be no
assurance that any such financing will be available on commercially
acceptable terms or at all or permitted by the terms of our existing
indebtedness

   as of december 31 2000 we had consolidated cash and cash equivalents of
4538 million including 621 million at ccusa 796 million at ccuk 11
million at crown atlantic and 68 million at ccal consolidated longterm
debt of 26027 million consolidated redeemable preferred stock of 8427
million and consolidated stockholders equity of 24209 million

   as of march 15 2001 crown atlantic had unused borrowing availability
under its amended credit facility of approximately 750 million and ccuk had
unused borrowing availability under its credit facility of approximately
pounds571 million 854 million as of march 15 2001 our subsidiaries
had approximately 4041 million of unused borrowing availability under the
2000 credit facility our various credit facilities require our subsidiaries
to maintain certain financial covenants and place restrictions on the ability
of our subsidiaries to among other things incur debt and liens pay
dividends make capital expenditures undertake transactions with affiliates
and make investments these facilities also limit the ability of the borrowing
subsidiaries to pay dividends to ccic

   if we are unable to refinance our subsidiary debt or renegotiate the terms
of such debt we may not be able to meet our debt service requirements
including interest payments on the notes in the future our 9 senior notes
our 9 12 senior notes and our 10 34 senior notes require annual cash
interest payments of approximately 162 million 119 million and 538
million respectively prior to november 15 2002 may 15 2004 and august 1
2004 the interest expense on our 10 58 discount notes our 10 38 discount
notes and our 11 14 discount notes respectively will be comprised solely
of the amortization of original issue discount thereafter the 10 58
discount notes the 10 38 discount notes and the 11 14 discount notes will
require annual cash interest payments of approximately 267 million 519
million and 293 million respectively prior to december 15 2003 we do not
expect to pay cash dividends on our exchangeable preferred stock or if
issued cash interest on the exchange debentures thereafter assuming all
dividends or interest have been paidinkind our exchangeable preferred stock
or if issued the exchange debentures will require annual cash dividend or
interest payments of approximately 478 million annual cash interest
payments on the ccuk bonds are pounds1125 168 million in addition our
various credit facilities will require periodic interest payments on amounts
borrowed thereunder

   as a holding company ccic will require distributions or dividends from its
subsidiaries or will be forced to use capital raised in debt and equity
offerings to fund its debt obligations including interest payments on the
cashpay notes and eventually the 10 58 discount notes the 10 38 discount
notes and the 11 14 discount notes the terms of the indebtedness of our
subsidiaries significantly limit their ability to distribute cash to ccic as
a result we will be required to apply a portion of the net proceeds from the
recent debt offerings to fund interest payments on the cashpay notes if we
do not retain sufficient funds from the offerings or any future financing we
may not be able to make our interest payments on the cashpay notes

   our ability to make scheduled payments of principal of or to pay interest
on our debt obligations and our ability to refinance any such debt
obligations will depend on our future performance which to a certain
extent is subject to general economic financial competitive legislative
regulatory and other factors that are beyond

our control we anticipate that we may need to refinance all or a portion of
our indebtedness on or prior to its scheduled maturity there can be no
assurance that we will be able to effect any required refinancings of our
indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all see item 1

compensation charges related to stock option grants and acquisitions

   during the period from april 24 1998 through july 15 1998 we granted
options to employees and executives for the purchase of 3236980 shares of
our common stock at an exercise price of 750 per share of such options
options for 1810730 shares vested upon consummation of the ipo and the
remaining options for 1426250 shares are vesting at 20 per year over five
years beginning one year from the date of grant in addition we assigned our
right to repurchase shares of our common stock from a stockholder at a price
of 626 per share to two individuals including a former director with
respect to 100000 of such shares since the granting of these options and the
assignment of these rights to repurchase shares occurred subsequent to the
date of the share exchange agreement with ccuks shareholders and at prices
substantially below the price to the public in the ipo we have recorded a
noncash general and administrative compensation charge related to these
options and shares based upon the difference between the respective exercise
and purchase prices and the price to the public in the ipo such compensation
charge will total approximately 184 million of which approximately 106
million was recognized upon consummation of the ipo for such options and
shares which

                                      48
page

vested upon consummation of the ipo and the remaining 78 million is being
recognized over five years approximately 16 million per year through the
second quarter of 2003 an additional 16 million in noncash general and
administrative compensation charges will be recognized through the third
quarter of 2001 for stock options issued to certain members of ccuks
management prior to the consummation of the share exchange

   in july 2000 we issued 1 199473 shares of our common stock and 2
options to purchase 17577 shares of our common stock with an exercise price
of 01 per share in connection with an acquisition by ccuk such shares and
options were deemed to be compensation to the former shareholders of the
acquired company who remain employed by the company as a result ccuk will
recognize noncash general and administrative compensation charges of
approximately 84 million over five years

   in september 2000 we issued 336600 shares of our common stock in
connection with an acquisition by ccusa of such shares 170710 were deemed
to be compensation to the former shareholders of the acquired company who
remain employed by the company as a result ccusa will recognize noncash
general and administrative compensation charges of approximately 59 million
over four years

impact of recently issued accounting standards

   in june 1998 the financial accounting standards board the fasb issued
statement of financial accounting standards no 133 accounting for derivative
instruments and hedging activities sfas 133 sfas 133 requires that
derivative instruments be recognized as either assets or liabilities in the
consolidated balance sheet based on their fair values changes in the fair
values of derivative instruments will be recorded either in results of
operations or in other comprehensive income depending on the intended use of
the derivative instrument the initial application of sfas 133 will be
reported as the effect of a change in accounting principle the company will
adopt the requirements of sfas 133 as of january 1 2001 the adoption of sfas
133 will result in a net transition adjustment gain of approximately 02
million in accumulated other comprehensive income the recognition of
approximately 04 million of derivative instrument assets and the recognition
of approximately 02 million of derivative instrument liabilities the
amounts for this transition adjustment are based on current fair value
measurements at the date of adoption of sfas 133 the company also expects
that the adoption of sfas 133 will increase the volatility of other
comprehensive income as reported in its future financial statements

could affect actual results and cause actual results to differ materially from
those results which might be projected forecast estimated or budgeted in
such forwardlooking statements include but are not limited to the factors
set forth in overview above and item 1 businessrisk factors



item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

   as a result of our international operating investing and financing
activities we are exposed to market risks which include changes in foreign
currency exchange rates and interest rates which may adversely affect our
results of operations and financial position in attempting to minimize the
risks andor costs associated with such activities we seek to manage exposure
to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates where
economically prudent to do so

   certain of the financial instruments we have used to obtain capital are
subject to market risks from fluctuations in market interest rates the
majority of our financial instruments however are longterm fixed interest
rate notes and debentures therefore fluctuations in market interest rates of
1 in 2001 would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial
results

   the majority of our foreign currency transactions are denominated in the
british pound sterling or the australian dollar which are the functional
currencies of ccuk and ccal respectively as a result of ccuks and ccals
transactions being denominated and settled in such functional currencies the
risks associated with currency fluctuations are generally limited to foreign
currency translation adjustments we do not currently hedge against foreign
currency translation risks and believe that foreign currency exchange risk is
not significant to our operations
