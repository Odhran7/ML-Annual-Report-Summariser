overview 

  

domino’s is the largest pizza company in the world with more than 18800 locations in over 90 markets around the world as of january 2 2022 and operates two distinct service models within its stores with a significant business in both delivery and carryout founded in 1960 our roots are in convenient pizza delivery while a significant amount of our retail sales also come from carryout customers we are a highly recognized global brand and we focus on value while serving neighborhoods locally through our large worldwide network of franchise owners and us companyowned stores we are primarily a franchisor with approximately 98 of domino’s stores currently owned and operated by our independent franchisees franchising enables an individual to be his or her own employer and maintain control over all employmentrelated matters and pricing decisions while also benefiting from the strength of the domino’s global brand and operating system with limited capital investment by us 

  

the domino’s business model is straightforward domino’s stores handcraft and serve quality food at a competitive price with easy ordering access and efficient service enhanced by our technological innovations our handtossed dough is made fresh and distributed to stores around the world by us and our franchisees 

 

 

domino’s generates revenues and earnings by charging royalties and fees to our franchisees royalties are ongoing percentofsales fees for use of the domino’s ® brand marks we also generate revenues and earnings by selling food equipment and supplies to franchisees through our supply chain operations primarily in the us and canada and by operating a number of companyowned stores in the united states franchisees profit by selling pizza and other complementary items to their local customers in our international markets we generally grant geographical rights to the domino’s pizza ® brand to master franchisees these master franchisees are charged with developing their geographical area and they may profit by subfranchising and selling food and equipment to those subfranchisees as well as by running pizza stores we believe that everyone in the system can benefit including the end consumer who can purchase domino’s menu items for themselves and their family conveniently and economically 

  

the domino’s business model can yield strong returns for our franchise owners and our companyowned stores it can also yield significant cash flows to us through a consistent franchise royalty payment and supply chain revenue stream with moderate capital expenditures we have historically returned cash to shareholders through dividend payments and share repurchases we believe we have a proven business model for success which includes leading with technology service and product innovation and leveraging our global scale which has historically driven strong returns for our shareholders 

  

our history 

  

we pioneered the pizza delivery business and have been delivering quality affordable food to our customers since 1960 we became “domino’s pizza” in 1965 and opened our first franchised store in 1967 over the last 60 years we have built domino’s into one of the most widelyrecognized consumer brands in the world we believe our commitment to value convenience quality and new products continues to keep consumers engaged with the brand 

  

during 2021 the uncertain environment created by the novel coronavirus “covid19” pandemic persisted however we continued to increase global retail sales while our supply chain operations experienced higher volumes as a result of the increase in retail sales in the us we launched our newest side item domino’s ovenbaked dips in three unique flavors including cheesy marinara five cheese and baked apple to pair with our domino’s bread twists additionally emphasis on technological innovation helped us achieve more than half of all global retail sales in 2021 from digital channels in the us we have developed several innovative ordering platforms including those for google home facebook messenger apple watch amazon echo twitter and more in 2019 we announced a partnership with nuro to further our exploration and testing of autonomous pizza delivery in 2021 we began a test of pizza delivery with nuro vehicles in houston texas in 2020 we also launched a new way to order contactless carryout nationwide – via domino’s carside delivery ®  which customers can choose when placing a prepaid online order with a twominute guarantee launched in 2021 this new service method emphasizes our commitment to serving hot and delicious pizza in a convenient contactless manner 

  

  

since 1998 the company has been structured with a leveraged balance sheet and has completed a number of recapitalization transactions the company’s most recent recapitalization transaction completed in april 2021 the “2021 recapitalization” primarily consisted of the issuance of 185 billion of fixed rate notes and a new 2000 million variable funding note facility as of january 2 2022 the company had 507 billion in total debt which included debt from its 2021 recapitalization and its previous recapitalization transactions in 2019 2018 2017 and 2015 the “2019 recapitalization” “2018 recapitalization” “2017 recapitalization” and the “2015 recapitalization” respectively and together with the 2021 recapitalization the “2021 2019 2018 2017 and 2015 recapitalizations” 

  

our industry 

  

the us qsr pizza category is large and fragmented from 2016 through 2021 the us qsr pizza category has grown from 359 billion to 406 billion it is the secondlargest category within the 3048 billion us qsr sector the us qsr pizza category is primarily comprised of delivery dinein and carryout with carryout and delivery comprising the two largest segments 

 

in the us we compete in the delivery and carryout segments of the pizza industry and we are the dollar market share leader for delivery and a growing leader in carryout delivery segment dollars of 198 billion in 2021 up from 131 billion in 2016 account for approximately 49 of total us qsr pizza the four industry leaders including domino’s account for over 59 of us pizza delivery based on reported consumer spending with the remaining dollars going to regional chains and independent establishments from 2016 to 2021 the carryout segment grew from 163 billion to 175 billion the four industry leaders including domino’s account for approximately 48 of the us carryout segment source the npd groupcrest ®  year ending november 2021 

  

in contrast to the us international pizza delivery is relatively underdeveloped with only domino’s and two other competitors having a significant global presence we believe that demand for pizza delivery and pizza carryout is large and growing throughout the world driven by international consumers’ increasing emphasis on convenience and our proven success of more than 35 years of conducting business abroad 

  

our competition 

  

the global pizza delivery and carryout segments as well as the broader qsr sector are highly competitive in the us we compete against regional and local companies as well as national chains pizza hut ®  papa john’s ® and little caesars pizza ®  internationally we compete primarily with pizza hut ®  papa john’s ® and countryspecific national and local pizzerias we generally compete on the basis of product quality location image service technology convenience and price our business and those of our competitors can be affected by changes in consumer tastes economic and health conditions demographic trends marketing advertising pricing and consumers’ disposable income we also compete with other food food delivery and order and delivery aggregation companies which have continued to grow in size and scale in recent years we compete not only for customers but also for management and hourly employees including store team members drivers and qualified franchisees as well as suitable real estate sites 

  

our customers 

  

our business is not dependent upon a single retail customer or small group of customers including franchisees no customer accounted for more than 10 of total consolidated revenues in 2021 2020 or 2019 as of january 2 2022 our largest franchisee based on store count domino’s pizza enterprises dmp asx operated 3229 stores in ten international markets and accounted for 17 of our total store count revenues from this master franchisee accounted for 17 of our consolidated revenues in 2021 our international franchise segment only requires a modest amount of general and administrative expenses to support its markets and does not have a cost of sales component therefore the vast majority of these royalty revenues result in profits to us 

  

our menu 

  

we offer a menu designed to present an attractive quality offering to customers while keeping it simple enough to minimize order errors and expedite ordertaking and food preparation our basic menu features pizza products with varying sizes and crust types our typical store also offers ovenbaked sandwiches pasta boneless chicken and chicken wings bread and dips side items desserts and soft drink products international markets vary toppings by country and culture such as the cheese and corn pizza in india or the octopus bomb shrimp in korea featuring shrimp octopus vegetables feta cream and horseradish sauce 

  

  

store image and operations 

  

we have been focused on pizza delivery for over 60 years and we also emphasize carryout as a significant component of our business the majority of our us and international stores are constructed in the carryoutfriendly pizza theater design many of these stores offer casual seating and enable customers to watch the preparation of their orders but do not offer a fullservice dinein experience as a result our stores generally do not require expensive restaurant facilities and staffing 

  

our business segments 

  

we operate and report three business segments us stores international franchise and supply chain 

  

us stores 

  

during 2021 our us stores segment accounted for 150 billion or 34 of our consolidated revenues our us stores segment consists primarily of our franchise operations which consisted of 6185 franchised stores located in the united states as of january 2 2022 we also operated a network of 375 us companyowned stores as of january 2 2022 

  

directly operating domino’s stores contributes significantly to our ability to act as a credible franchisor we also use our companyowned stores as test sites for technological innovation and promotions as well as operational improvements we also use them for training new store managers and operations team members as well as developing prospective franchisees while we are primarily a franchised business we continuously evaluate our mix of us companyowned and franchise stores as of january 2 2022 franchised stores represented approximately 94 of our total store count within our us stores segment 

  

us franchise profile 

  

as of january 2 2022 our network of 6185 us franchise stores was owned and operated by 735 independent us franchisees our franchise formula enables franchisees to benefit from our brand recognition with a relatively low initial capital investment as of january 2 2022 the average us franchisee owned and operated approximately eight stores and had been in our franchise system for over 18 years additionally 22 of our us franchisees operated more than 50 stores including our largest us franchisee who operated 177 stores and 216 of our us franchisees each operated one store each as of that date 

  

we apply rigorous standards to prospective us franchisees we generally require them to manage a store for at least one year and graduate from our franchise management school program before being granted the right to franchise this enables us to observe the operational and financial performance of a potential franchisee prior to entering into a longterm agreement substantially all of our independent us franchise owners started their careers with us as delivery drivers or in other instore positions which we believe offers advantages in terms of familiarity with our business and store operations in addition we generally restrict the ability of us franchisees to be involved in other businesses which we believe helps focus our franchisees’ attention on operating their stores we believe these characteristics and standards are largely unique within the franchise industry and have resulted in qualified and focused franchisees operating domino’s stores we maintain a productive relationship with our independent franchise owners through regional franchise teams distributing materials that help franchise stores comply with our standards and using franchise advisory groups that facilitate communications between us and our franchisees we consider our relationship with our us franchisees to be good 

  

us franchise agreements 

  

we enter into franchise agreements with us franchisees under which the franchisee is generally granted the right to operate a store in a particular location for a term of ten years with an ability to renew for an additional term of ten years we had a franchise agreement renewal rate of approximately 99 in 2021 under the current standard franchise agreement we assign an exclusive area of primary responsibility to each franchised store each franchisee is generally required to pay a 55 royalty fee on sales as well as certain technology fees in certain instances we will collect lower rates based on certain incentives 

  

  

our stores in the united states currently contribute 6 of their sales to fund national marketing and advertising campaigns subject in certain instances to lower rates based on certain incentives and waivers these funds are administered by domino’s national advertising fund inc “dnaf” our consolidated notforprofit advertising subsidiary the funds are primarily used to purchase media for advertising and also to support market research field communications public relations commercial production talent payments and other activities to promote the domino’s brand in addition to the national and marketlevel advertising contributions us stores generally spend additional funds on local store marketing activities 

  

we have the contractual right subject to state law to terminate a franchise agreement for a variety of reasons including but not limited to a franchisee’s failure to adhere to the company’s franchise agreement failure to make required payments or failure to adhere to specified company policies and standards 

  

international franchise 

  

during 2021 our international franchise segment accounted for 2980 million or 7 of our consolidated revenues this segment is comprised of a network of franchised stores in more than 90 international markets as of january 2 2022 we had 12288 international franchise stores the principal sources of revenues from those operations are royalty payments generated by retail sales from franchised stores as well as certain technology fees 

  

our international franchisees employ our basic standard operating model and adapt it to satisfy the local eating habits and consumer preferences of various regions outside the us currently the vast majority of our international stores operate under master franchise agreements 

  

we believe domino’s appeals to potential international franchisees because of our recognized brand name and technological leadership the moderate capital expenditures required to open and operate the stores and the system’s desirable storelevel profitability stores in seven of our ten largest international markets in terms of store count are operated by master franchise companies that are publicly traded on stock exchanges as noted in the below table the following table shows our store count as of january 2 2022 in our ten largest international markets which accounted for approximately 62 of our international stores as of that date 

  

   

international franchisee profile 

  

the vast majority of our markets outside of the us are operated by master franchisees with franchise and distribution rights for entire regions or countries in a few select markets we franchise directly to individual store operators prospective master franchisees are required to possess local market knowledge to establish and develop domino’s stores with the ability to identify and access targeted real estate sites as well as expertise in local laws customs culture and consumer behavior we also seek candidates that have access to sufficient capital to meet growth and development plans we consider our relationship with our international franchisees to be good 

  

international master franchise and other agreements 

  

our international master franchise agreements generally grant the franchisee exclusive rights to develop and subfranchise stores and the right to operate supply chain centers in particular geographic areas agreements are generally for a term of ten years with options to renew for additional terms the agreements typically contain growth clauses requiring franchisees to open a minimum number of stores within a specified period the master franchisee is generally required to pay an initial onetime franchise fee as well as an additional franchise fee upon the opening of each new store the master franchisee is also required to pay a continuing royalty fee as a percentage of sales which varies among international markets and may also differ based on certain incentives and concessions and averaged approximately 30 in 2021 we also have agreements with certain of our international master franchisees with respect to certain technology fees 

  

  

  

supply chain 

  

during 2021 our supply chain segment accounted for 256 billion or 59 of our consolidated revenues we operate 21 regional dough manufacturing and supply chain centers in the us two thin crust manufacturing facilities one vegetable processing center and one center providing equipment and supplies to our us and certain international stores we also operate five dough manufacturing and supply chain centers in canada we plan to continue investing in additional supply chain centers and capacity initiatives in the future including one additional regional dough manufacturing and supply chain center that is expected to open in fiscal 2022 our supply chain segment leases a fleet of more than 900 tractors and trailers our centers produce fresh dough and purchase receive store and deliver quality food and other complementary items to substantially all of our us stores and most of our canadian franchised stores we regularly supply over 7100 stores with various food and supplies 

  

we believe our franchisees voluntarily choose to obtain food supplies and equipment from us because we offer the most efficient convenient and costeffective alternative while also offering both quality and consistency our supply chain segment offers profitsharing arrangements to us and canadian franchisees who purchase all of their food for their stores from our centers these profitsharing arrangements generally offer participating franchisees and companyowned stores with 50 or a higher percentage in the case of companyowned stores and certain franchisees who operate a larger number of stores of the pretax profit from our supply chain center operations we believe these arrangements strengthen our ties to and provide aligned benefits with franchisees 

  

thirdparty suppliers 

  

a significant amount of our annual food spend is with suppliers with whom we maintain longstanding partnerships our supply partners are required to meet strict quality standards to ensure food safety we review and evaluate these partners’ quality assurance programs through among other actions onsite visits thirdparty audits and product evaluations designed to ensure compliance with our standards we believe the length and quality of our relationships with thirdparty suppliers provides us with priority service and quality products at competitive prices 

  

cheese is our largest food cost the price we charge to our us franchisees for cheese is formulabased with the chicago mercantile exchange cheddar block price as the primary component plus a supply chain markup as cheese prices fluctuate our revenues and margin percentages in our supply chain segment also fluctuate however actual supply chain dollar margins remain unchanged we currently purchase our us pizza cheese from a single supplier under our september 2017 agreement our us supplier agreed to provide the company with an uninterrupted supply of cheese and the company agreed to a sevenyear pricing schedule to purchase all of its us pizza cheese from this supplier while we expect to meet the terms of this agreement if we do not we will be required to repay certain negotiated cost savings as provided in the agreement the majority of our meat toppings in the us come from a single supplier under a contract that expires in june 2022 we have the right to terminate these arrangements for quality failures and for certain uncured breaches 

  

we have entered into a multiyear agreement with cocacola ® for the us this contract renegotiated in june 2019 provides for cocacola to continue to be our exclusive beverage supplier and expires on december 31 2023 or at such time as a minimum number of cases of cocacola products are purchased by domino’s whichever occurs later 

  

we believe alternative thirdparty suppliers are available for all of these referenced products while we may incur additional costs if we are required to replace any of our supply partners we do not believe such additional costs would have a material adverse effect on our business we continually evaluate each supply category to determine the optimal sourcing strategy 

  

we have not experienced any significant shortages of supplies or delays in receiving our inventories or products prices charged to us by our supply partners are subject to fluctuation and we have historically been able to pass increased costs and savings on to stores we periodically enter into supplier contracts to manage the risk from changes in commodity prices we do not engage in speculative transactions nor do we hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes 

  

  

our strengths 

  

strong brand equity 

  

we are the largest pizza company in the world and we believe our domino’s brand is one of the most widelyrecognized consumer brands in the world we are the recognized world leader in pizza delivery and have a significant business in carryout we believe consumers associate our brand with the timely delivery of quality affordable food and technological innovation 

  

over the past five years our us franchise and companyowned stores have invested an estimated 24 billion in national cooperative and local advertising our international franchisees also invest significant amounts in advertising efforts in their markets we continue to reinforce our brand with extensive advertising through various media channels 

  

we are the number one pizza delivery company in the us with approximately 31 share of pizza delivery based on consumer spending data for the year ending november 2021 for the same period we are also a growing leader in carryout with approximately 16 share of carryout pizza consumer spending source the npd groupcrest ®  year ending november 2021 with 6560 stores located in the us our store delivery areas cover a majority of us households our share position and scale allow us to leverage our purchasing power supply chain strength and marketing investments we believe our scale and market coverage allow us to effectively serve our customers’ demands for convenience and timely delivery outside the us we have significant market share positions in many of the markets in which we compete 

  

strong and proven business model 

  

our business model generates us and international franchise royalties and fees supply chain revenue and retail sales at companyowned stores we have developed this model over our many years of operation and it is anchored by strong storelevel economics which provide an entrepreneurial incentive for our franchisees and historically has generated demand for new stores over the past ten years average us store profitability in the domino’s system has increased meaningfully resulting in higher profitability for our franchise owners our franchise system in turn has produced strong and consistent earnings for us through royalty payments and through supply chain revenues 

  

we developed a costefficient store model characterized by a delivery and carryoutoriented store design with moderate capital requirements and a menu of quality valueoriented and affordable items at the store level we believe the simplicity and efficiency of our operations give us significant advantages over our competitors who in many cases also focus on dinein or have broader menu offerings at the supply chain level we believe we provide quality good value and consistency for our franchise customers while also driving profits for us which we share with our franchisees under the profitsharing arrangements described above 

  

our menu simplifies and streamlines production and delivery processes and maximizes economies of scale on purchases of our principal food items in addition our stores including those in our pizza theater image are generally smaller and less expensive to build furnish and maintain as compared to many other restaurant concepts and they create a positive experience for our carryout customers the combination of this efficient store model and strong sales volume has resulted in strong storelevel economics and we believe makes domino’s an attractive business opportunity for existing and prospective franchisees around the world we and our franchisees are continuing to focus on growing our global store count in recent years we have focused specifically on increasing our presence in our existing markets to provide better service to our customers including shrinking our delivery areas to provide better delivery service and adding locations that are closer to our carryout customers we call this approach our fortressing strategy 

  

we believe our store financial returns have led to a strong welldiversified franchise system this established franchise system has produced strong cash flows and earnings for us enabling us to invest in the domino’s brand stores technology and supply chain centers pay dividends repurchase and retire shares of our common stock and service our debt obligations 

  

  

technological innovation 

  

technological innovation is vital to our brand and our longterm success and digital ordering is critical to competing in the global pizza and broader qsr industries emphasis on technological innovation helped us achieve more than half of all global retail sales in 2021 from digital channels in the us we have developed several innovative ordering platforms including those for google home facebook messenger apple watch amazon echo twitter and more in 2019 we announced a partnership with nuro to further our exploration and testing of autonomous pizza delivery in 2020 we added gps to our domino’s tracker which allows customers to monitor the progress of their food from the preparation stages to the time it is in the oven to the time it arrives at their doors in mid2020 we launched a new way to order contactless carryout nationwide – via domino’s carside delivery which customers can choose when placing a prepaid online order 

  

our piece of the pie rewards ® loyalty program is meant to reward customers with a program that is simple to understand and easy to use upon signing up for the program customers become rewards members and can earn points for their orders when rewards members reach a certain amount of points they can redeem their points for free pizza rewards members may also receive exclusive membersonly discounts and bonus offers we may also occasionally provide additional opportunities for participating customers to benefit under the piece of the pie rewards program 

  

this improved functionality has been developed to work seamlessly with our domino’s pulse ™ pointofsale system our domino’s pulse system is designed to drive operating efficiencies for our franchisees and our corporate management and assist franchisees in independently managing their business as of january 2 2022 domino’s pulse is being used in every companyowned and franchised store in the us and in approximately 77 of our international stores we believe utilizing domino’s pulse with our integrated technology solutions throughout our system provides us with competitive advantages over other concepts we intend to continue to enhance and grow our online ordering digital marketing and technological capabilities 

  

product innovation 

  

we believe our core handtossed pizza recipe has contributed to longterm growth in customer reorder rates consumer traffic and increased sales this recipe is now in use in other markets around the world our more than 60 years of innovation have resulted in numerous new product developments during 2021 we launched our newest side item domino’s ovenbaked dips in three unique flavors including cheesy marinara five cheese and baked apple to pair with our domino’s bread twists product innovation is also present in our global markets where our master franchisees have the ability to recommend products to suit their local market tastes products can range from simple to indulgent including the cheese fondue fire meat in japan cheese tomato and truffle cream sauce barbeque pork bacon and vegetables and the saumoneta in france light cream potatoes onions smoked salmon and dill 

  

internal dough manufacturing and supply chain system 

  

in addition to generating significant revenues and earnings in the us and canada we believe our vertically integrated dough manufacturing and supply chain system enhances the quality and consistency of our products enhances our relationships with franchisees and leverages economies of scale to offer lower costs to our stores it also allows store managers to focus on store operations and customer service by relieving them of the responsibility of mixing dough in the stores and sourcing other ingredients many of our international master franchisees also profit from running supply chain businesses in their respective markets 

  

  

  

human capital 

  

as of january 2 2022 we had approximately 13500 employees including 9000 employees supporting our us companyowned stores and us franchise operations our us stores segment approximately 3000 employees supporting our us and canadian supply chain operations our supply chain segment approximately 100 employees supporting our international franchise operations our international franchise segment and approximately 1400 corporate employees approximately 6100 of our employees are parttime and approximately 7400 are fulltime equivalent our franchisees are independent business owners so their employees are not our employees and therefore are not included in our employee count none of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement we consider our relationship with our employees to be good

we along with our franchisees are subject to various federal state and local laws affecting the operation of our business each store is subject to licensing and regulation by a number of governmental authorities which include zoning health safety sanitation building and fire agencies in the jurisdiction in which the store is located in connection with maintaining our stores we may be required to expend funds to meet certain federal state and local regulations including regulations requiring that remodeled or altered stores be accessible to persons with disabilities difficulties in obtaining or the failure to obtain required licenses or approvals could delay or prevent the opening of a new store in a particular area or cause an existing store to cease operations our supply chain facilities are also licensed and subject to similar regulations by federal state and local health and fire codes 

  

we are also subject to the fair labor standards act and various other federal and state laws governing such matters as minimum wage requirements overtime and other working conditions and citizenship requirements a significant number of both our and our franchisees’ food service personnel are paid at rates related to the applicable minimum wage and past increases in the minimum wage have increased labor costs as would future increases 

  

  

we are subject to the rules and regulations of the federal trade commission “ftc” and various state laws regulating the offer and sale of franchises the ftc and various state laws require that we furnish a franchise disclosure document containing certain information to prospective franchisees and a number of states require registration of the franchise disclosure document with state authorities we are operating under exemptions from registration in several states based on the net worth of our subsidiary domino’s pizza franchising llc and experience we believe our franchise disclosure document together with any applicable state versions or supplements and franchising procedures comply in all material respects with both the ftc guidelines and all applicable state laws regulating franchising in those states in which we have offered franchises 

  

internationally our franchise stores are subject to national and local laws and regulations that are often similar to those affecting our us stores including laws and regulations concerning franchises labor health sanitation and safety our international stores are also often subject to tariffs and regulations on imported commodities and equipment and laws regulating foreign investment we believe our international disclosure statements franchise offering documents and franchising procedures comply in all material respects with the laws of the foreign countries in which we have offered franchises 

  

privacy and data protection 

  

we are subject to a number of privacy and data protection laws and regulations both in the us and globally the legislative and regulatory landscape for privacy and data protection continues to evolve and there has been an increase in attention given to privacy and data protection issues with the potential to directly affect our business this includes recentlyenacted laws and regulations in the us and internationally requiring notification to individuals and government authorities of security breaches involving certain categories of personal information any changes in privacy or data protection laws or regulations could also impact our marketing techniques and could change our marketing strategies we have a privacy policy posted on our website at wwwdominoscom  the security of our financial data customer information and other personal information is a priority for us 

  

trademarks 

  

we have many registered trademarks and believe that the domino’s mark and domino’s pizza names and logos in particular have significant value and are important to our business our policy is to pursue registration of our trademarks and to vigorously oppose the infringement of any of our trademarks we license the use of our registered marks to franchisees through franchise agreements 

  

environmental matters 

  

we are not aware of any federal state or local environmental laws or regulations that we would expect to materially affect our earnings or competitive position or result in material capital expenditures however we cannot predict the effect of possible future environmental legislation or regulations during 2021 there were no material environmental compliancerelated capital expenditures and no such material expenditures are anticipated in 2022

 item 1a risk f actors 

  

for a business as large and globally diverse as the company a wide range of factors could materially affect future developments and performance in addition to the factors affecting specific business operations identified in connection with the description of these operations and the financial results of these operations elsewhere in this report and our other filings with the sec we believe the most significant risk factors affecting our business include the following 

 

business operational and industry risks 

 

the quick service restaurant qsr pizza category and the food service and food delivery markets in general are highly competitive and such competition could adversely affect our operating results 

 

in the us we compete primarily against regional and local companies as well as national chains pizza hut ®  papa john’s ® and little caesars pizza ®  internationally we compete primarily with pizza hut ®  papa john’s ® and countryspecific national and local companies we may experience increased competition from existing or new companies in the delivery and carryout pizza categories in addition to competition from order and delivery aggregators both in the pizza category and more broadly that may create increasing pressures to grow our business in order to maintain our market share competition for both customers and drivers from these order and delivery aggregators and other food delivery services has substantially increased as order and delivery aggregators have continued to grow in size and scale additionally we face competition from the supermarket industry and meal kit and food delivery providers with the improvement of prepared food and meal kit offerings expansion in meal delivery platforms and services and the trend towards convergence in grocery deli retail and restaurant services 

 

we also compete on a broader scale with quick service and other international national regional and local restaurants the overall food service market food delivery market and the qsr market are intensely competitive with respect to food quality price service image convenience and concept and are often affected by changes in 

  

• consumer tastes 

• international national regional or local economic conditions 

• marketing advertising and pricing including both price increases and discounting 

• disposable purchasing power and demographic trends and 

• currency fluctuations related to international operations 

  

we compete within the food service market and the qsr market not only for customers but also for management and hourly employees including store team members drivers and qualified franchisees as well as suitable real estate sites we and our franchisees have recently faced an increasingly competitive labor market due to sustained labor shortages and increased turnover resulting in part from the covid19 pandemic which has caused us and our franchisees to in certain cases reduce store hours and delay store openings and has prevented us from running promotions which has impacted our sales service levels and customer experience and could ultimately impact our growth and competitive position our success is also dependent in large part upon our ability to maintain and enhance the goodwill and reputation of our brand our customers’ connection to our brand and a positive relationship with our franchisees and the communities in which we and our franchisees operate 

 

our supply chain segment is also subject to competition from outside suppliers while substantially all us franchisees purchased food equipment and supplies from us in 2021 us franchisees are not required to purchase food equipment or supplies from us and they may choose to purchase from outside suppliers if other suppliers who meet our qualification standards were to offer lower prices or better service to our franchisees for their ingredients and supplies and as a result our franchisees chose not to purchase from our us supply chain centers our financial condition business and results of operations would be adversely affected 

 

if we are unable to maintain our competitive position we could experience downward pressure on prices lower demand for our products reduced margins loss of management or hourly employees reduced service levels disruption in our supply chain the inability to take advantage of new business opportunities and the loss of market share all of which would have an adverse effect on our operating results and could cause our stock price to decline 

 

  

  

worldwide economic activity has been and is expected to continue to be adversely affected by the ongoing covid19 pandemic the scale and scope of which is ultimately unknown which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

the ongoing global covid19 pandemic continues to impact worldwide economic activity and create uncertainty a public health pandemic such as covid19 poses the risk that we andor our employees franchisees supply chain centers suppliers customers and other partners may be or may continue to be prevented from conducting business activities for an indefinite period of time including due to shutdowns travel restrictions social distancing requirements and other restrictions that have been or may be suggested or mandated by governmental authorities or due to the impact of the disease itself on a business’ workforces in addition covid19 may impact the willingness of customers to purchase food prepared outside of the home the covid19 pandemic may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described throughout this report including but not limited to those relating to our growth strategy our supply chain and increased food and labor costs availability of labor disruption in operations loss of key employees our indebtedness general economic conditions and our international operations in response to governmental requirements we and our franchisees have implemented a number of measures including among others temporarily closing certain of our stores modifying certain stores’ hours and closing locations to instore dining though some of these measures have since been rolled back we continue to monitor additional developments we have also made additional operating changes in response to changes in consumer behavior and preferences resulting from covid19 including offering contactless delivery and carryout options to our customers while it is not possible at this time to estimate the full impact that covid19 could have on our business going forward the continued spread of the virus and the measures taken in response have disrupted our operations and could disrupt our supply chain which could adversely impact our business financial condition and results of operations the covid19 pandemic and mitigation measures have also impacted global economic conditions which could have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition the company’s sales and operating results may be affected by uncertain or changing economic and market conditions arising in connection with and in response to the covid19 pandemic including inflation changes to consumer demand availability of labor political instability or other changes potential federal state or local covid19 vaccine andor testing mandates could also materially impact our results if we or our franchised stores face a reduction in available labor andor incur additional compliance costs as a result of any imposed mandate while the company has seen an increase in sales in certain markets including within the us during the covid19 pandemic including increased sales related to heightened reliance on delivery and carryout businesses future sales are not possible to estimate and it is unclear whether and to what extent sales will return to more normalized levels if and when consumer behavior and general economic and business activity return to prepandemic levels the significance of the operational and financial impact to the company will depend on how long and widespread the disruptions caused by covid19 and the corresponding response to contain the virus and treat those affected by it prove to be 

 

if we fail to successfully implement our growth strategy which includes opening new us and international stores our ability to increase our revenues and operating profits could be adversely affected 

 

a significant component of our growth strategy includes the opening of new us both companyowned as well as franchised stores and international franchised stores we and our franchisees face many challenges in opening new stores including among others 

  

• construction permitting or development delays relating to the ongoing covid19 pandemic 

• employment and training of qualified personnel including availability of store team members 

• selection and availability of suitable new store sites and the ability to renew leases in quality locations 

• availability and negotiation of leases and financing with acceptable terms 

• securing required us or foreign governmental permits licenses and approvals and 

• general economic and business conditions including increases in food costs and labor costs which could impact profitability 

  

the opening of additional franchise stores also depends in part upon the availability of prospective franchisees who meet our criteria and the ability of these franchisees to attract and retain qualified personnel our failure to add a significant number of new stores would adversely affect our ability to increase revenues and operating income additionally our growth strategy and the success of new stores depend in large part on the availability of suitable store sites if we and our franchisees are not able to secure leases in desired locations on favorable terms or to renew such leases our business and results of operations may be adversely affected 

  

  

we and our franchisees are currently planning to expand our us and international operations in many of the markets where we currently operate and in select new markets this may require considerable management time as well as startup expenses for market development before any significant revenues and earnings are generated operations in new foreign markets may achieve low margins or may be unprofitable and expansion in existing markets may be affected by local economic and market conditions in addition we expect to continue our strategy of building additional stores in markets and regions where we have existing stores a strategy we refer to as “fortressing” which may negatively impact sales at existing stores therefore as we continue to expand we or our franchisees may not experience the operating margins we expect our results of operations may be negatively impacted and our stock price may decline additionally we have an equity investment in dpc dash ltd “dpc dash” as further discussed elsewhere in this report through its subsidiaries dpc dash serves as the company’s master franchisee in china that owns and operates domino’s pizza stores in that market these types of investments are inherently risky if dpc dash does not succeed or is unable to successfully execute its growth strategy we may be forced to record impairment charges and could lose some or all of our investment 

 

we may also pursue strategic acquisitions as part of our business if we are able to identify acquisition candidates such acquisitions may be financed to the extent permitted under our debt agreements with substantial debt or with potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities and may not be successful 

 

labor shortages and increases in food labor and other costs could adversely affect our profitability and operating results 

 

we have recently experienced increased labor shortages at many of our stores and supply chain centers and our franchisees have experienced similar labor shortages at their stores while there historically has been some level of ordinary course turnover of employees the covid19 pandemic and resulting actions and impacts have exacerbated labor shortages and increased turnover labor shortages and increased turnover rates within our team members and the employees of our franchisees have led to and could in the future lead to increased costs such as increased overtime to meet demand and increased wage rates to attract and retain team members and could negatively affect our and our franchisees’ ability to efficiently operate our respective businesses and result in a negative impact on service and customer experience given the inflation rates in fiscal 2021 there has been and may continue to be increases in food costs and labor costs which have and could further impact our profitability and that of our franchisees and which could impact the opening of new us and international franchised stores and adversely affect our operating results factors such as inflation increased food costs increased labor and employee health and benefit costs increased rent costs and increased energy costs may adversely affect our operating costs and profitability and those of our franchisees and could result in menu price increases most of the factors affecting costs are beyond our control and in many cases we may not be able to pass along these increased costs to our customers or franchisees and to the extent we were to raise menu prices to offset these costs could result in decreased consumer demand sales and profitability most ingredients used in our pizza particularly cheese are subject to significant price fluctuations as a result of seasonality weather demand and other factors for example we have experienced increased volatility in prices for some ingredients during the covid19 pandemic which may continue even if the pandemic recedes cheese is a significant cost to us representing approximately 25 of the market basket purchased by our companyowned stores 

 

additionally while we strive to engage in a competitive bidding process for our ingredients because certain of these ingredients including meat products may only be available from a limited number of vendors we may not always be able to do so effectively furthermore if we need to seek new suppliers we may be subject to pricing or other terms less favorable to us than those reflected in our current supply arrangements labor costs are largely a function of the minimum wage for a majority of our store personnel and certain supply chain center personnel and generally are also a function of the availability of labor in addition to the increases in labor costs described above several jurisdictions in which we operate have recently approved minimum wage increases federal state and local proposals that increase minimum wage requirements or mandate other employee matters could to the extent implemented materially increase our labor and other costs as more jurisdictions implement minimum wage increases we expect our labor costs will continue to increase the advent of legislation aimed at predictive scheduling could impact labor for our stores and our franchisees’ stores additionally while we do not currently have any unionized employees certain employees of other companies in our industry have recently become unionized if a significant portion of our employees were to become unionized our labor costs could increase and our business could be negatively affected by other union requirements that increase our costs disrupt our business reduce our flexibility and impact our employee culture further our responses to any union organizing efforts could negatively impact how our brand is perceived labor costs and food costs including cheese generally represent approximately 50 to 60 of the sales at a typical companyowned store 

  

  

shortages interruptions or disruptions in the supply or delivery of fresh food products and store equipment could adversely affect our operating results 

 

we and our franchisees are dependent on frequent deliveries of food products that meet our specifications as well as adequate supply of store equipment we have single suppliers or a limited number of suppliers for certain of our ingredients including pizza cheese and meat toppings while we believe there are adequate reserve quantities and potential alternative suppliers shortages interruptions or disruptions in the supply of food products and store equipment caused by increased demand capacity constraints problems in production or distribution product recalls financial or other difficulties of suppliers inclement weather or other conditions could adversely affect the availability quality and cost of ingredients and equipment we have in the past experienced disruptions within our supply chain resulting from among other things capacity volume systems staffing operational and covid19related challenges and may experience such supply chain disruptions again in the future which could materially and adversely affect our business and operational results additionally the effects of climate change could increase the frequency and duration of weather impacts on our operations and could adversely affect our operating results 

 

the food service market is affected by consumer preferences and perceptions changes in these preferences and perceptions may reduce the demand for our products which would reduce sales and harm our business 

 

food service businesses are affected by changes in consumer tastes international national regional and local economic conditions marketing advertising pricing including both price increases and discounting and demographic trends for instance if prevailing health or dietary preferences cause consumers to avoid pizza and other products we offer in favor of foods that are perceived as healthier our business and operating results would be harmed moreover because we are primarily dependent on a single product if consumer demand for pizza should decrease our business would suffer more than if we had a more diversified menu as many other food service businesses do the preferences of customers also may change as a result of advances in technology or alternative delivery methods or channels if we are not able to respond to these changes or our competitors respond to these changes more effectively our business and operating results could be adversely affected 

 

reports of product contamination foodborne illness or food tampering may reduce sales and harm our business 

 

reports whether true or not of product contamination foodborne illnesses such as e coli avian flu bovine spongiform encephalopathy hepatitis a trichinosis or salmonella and injuries caused by food tampering have in the past severely injured the reputations of participants in the qsr market and could in the future as well these events could occur both at the store and supply chain center levels if such an event was to occur we may not be able to respond to it quickly and effectively the potential for acts of terrorism affecting our global food supply also exists and if such an event occurs could have a negative impact on us and could severely hurt sales and profits in addition our reputation is an important asset as a result anything that damages our reputation could immediately and severely affect our sales and profits media reports of product contamination illnesses and injuries whether accurate or not could force some stores to close or otherwise reduce sales at such stores moreover as further described below social media has dramatically increased the rate at which negative publicity including as it relates to foodborne illness can be disseminated before there is any meaningful opportunity to respond to or address an issue even reports of foodborne illnesses or food tampering occurring solely at the restaurants of competitors could by resulting in negative publicity about the restaurant industry in general adversely affect us on a local regional national or international basis our international operations expose us to further risk as our master franchisees are responsible for obtaining their own supply of food and equipment subject to their compliance with our quality standards a decrease in sales due to these health concerns or negative publicity or as a result of the closure of any domino’s stores could adversely affect our results of operations 

 

we do not have longterm contracts with certain of our suppliers and as a result they could seek to significantly increase prices or fail to deliver 

 

we do not have longterm contracts or arrangements with certain of our suppliers although in the past we have not experienced significant problems with our suppliers our suppliers may implement significant price increases or may not meet our requirements including those that may result from increases in volume in a timely fashion or at all the occurrence of any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on the ability of our supply chain centers to deliver necessary products to our stores and those of our franchisees and on our results of operations 

  

  

any prolonged disruption in the operations of any of our dough manufacturing and supply chain centers could harm our business 

 

we operate 21 regional dough manufacturing and supply chain centers in the us two thin crust manufacturing facilities one vegetable processing center and one center providing equipment and supplies to our us and certain international stores we also operate five dough manufacturing and supply chain centers in canada we plan to continue investing in additional supply chain capacity in the future given the capacity limitations we are currently facing resulting from the growth of our business our us dough manufacturing and supply chain centers service all of our companyowned and substantially all of our us franchise stores as a result any prolonged disruption in the operations of any of these facilities whether due to technical systems operational or labor difficulties destruction or damage to the facility real estate issues limited capacity or other reasons could adversely affect our business and operating results 

 

our inability or failure to recognize respond to and effectively manage the accelerated impact of social media could adversely impact our business 

 

the use of social media platforms including blogs social media websites chat platforms and other forms of internetbased communications that allow individuals access to a broad audience of consumers and other persons including to our customers and the general public and other consumeroriented technologies has increased the speed and accessibility of information dissemination and given users the ability to more effectively organize collective actions such as boycotts and other branddamaging behaviors negative publicity related to our food products or stores or negative publicity related to actions by our executives team members or franchisees and their team members or others perceived to be associated with us or our franchisees could harm our business brand reputation marketing partners financial condition and results of operations regardless of the accuracy of such negative publicity failure to use or respond to social media campaigns effectively could lead to a decline in brand value and revenue in addition a failure of us our employees our franchisees or third parties acting at our direction to abide by applicable laws and regulations in the use of social media may adversely impact our brand reputation marketing partners financial condition and results of operations or subject us or our franchisees to fines or other penalties 

 

our success depends in part upon effective advertising and lower advertising funds may reduce our ability to adequately market the domino’s pizza brand 

 

we have been routinely named a leading national advertiser by advertising age and our success depends in part on continued effective advertising each domino’s store located in the us is obligated to contribute 6 of its sales subject in certain instances to lower rates based on certain incentives and waivers to dnaf which uses such fees for national advertising in addition to contributions for local marketlevel advertising we currently anticipate that this 6 contribution rate will remain in place for the foreseeable future while additional funds for advertising in the past have been provided by us our franchisees and other third parties none of these additional funds are legally required the lack of continued financial support for advertising activities could significantly curtail our marketing efforts which may in turn materially and adversely affect our business and our operating results 

 

loss of key employees or our inability to attract and retain new qualified employees could hurt our business and inhibit our ability to operate and grow successfully 

 

our success in the highly competitive pizza delivery and carryout business will continue to depend to a significant extent on our leadership team and other key management personnel although we have entered into employment agreements with richard e allison jr and russell j weiner each of these executives may terminate his agreement on ninety days’ notice our other executive officers may terminate their employment pursuant to their employment agreements at any time as a result we may not be able to retain our executive officers and key personnel or attract additional qualified management 

  

while we do not have longterm employment agreements with our executive officers for all of our executive officers we have noncompete and nonsolicitation agreements that extend for 24 months following the termination of such executive officer’s employment our success will also continue to depend on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel to operate our stores dough manufacturing and supply chain centers and international operations the loss of these employees or our inability to recruit and retain qualified personnel including storelevel team members or our inability to adequately respond to changes in the labor market could have a material adverse effect on our operating results changes we make to our current and future work environments may not meet the needs or expectations of our employees and may be perceived as less favorable compared to other companies policies which could negatively impact our ability to hire and retain qualified personnel 

  

  

our international operations subject us to additional risk such risks and costs may differ in each country in which we and our franchisees do business and may cause our profitability to decline due to increased costs 

 

we conduct a significant and growing portion of our business outside the us our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected if global markets in which our franchise stores compete are affected by changes in political economic or other factors these factors many over which neither we nor our master franchisees have control may include both internal and external factors including 

  

• recessionary or expansive trends in international markets and global markets and economic downturns 

• changing labor conditions and difficulties in staffing and managing our foreign operations 

• increases in the taxes we pay and other changes in applicable tax laws both in the us and globally 

• tariffs and trade barriers 

• legal and regulatory changes and the burdens and costs of our compliance with a variety of foreign laws changes in inflation rates or exchange rates and the imposition of restrictions on currency conversion or the transfer of funds 

• ongoing and new relationships between our master franchisees and order and delivery aggregators our master franchisees may partner with internationally and the success of those aggregators and relationships 

• difficulty in collecting our royalties and longer payment cycles 

• expropriation of private enterprises 

• the inherent risk of doing business in china resulting from our equity investment in dpc dash 

• increases in antiamerican sentiment and the identification of domino’s as an american brand and 

• political and economic instability and uncertainty around the world including uncertainty arising from the ongoing covid19 pandemic 

  

our earnings and business growth strategy depend on the success of our franchisees and we may be harmed by actions taken by our franchisees or employees of our franchisees that are outside of our control 

 

a significant portion of our earnings comes from royalties and fees generated by our franchise stores franchisees are independent operators and their employees are not our employees we provide tools that franchisees can consider using in training their employees but the quality of franchise store operations and our brand and branded products may be diminished by numerous factors beyond our control consequently franchisees may not operate stores in a manner consistent with our standards and requirements or they or their employees may take other actions that adversely affect the value of our brand in such event our business and reputation may suffer and as a result our revenues and stock price could decline our success also depends in part on continuing positive relationships with our franchisees and positive relationships between our international master franchisees and their corresponding subfranchisees and if those relationships were to deteriorate our revenues and stock price could decline while we try to ensure that franchisees maintain the quality of the domino’s brand and branded products and comply with their franchise agreements franchisees may take actions that adversely affect the value of our intellectual property or reputation or that are inconsistent with their contractual obligations although our franchise arrangements permit the applicable franchisor to terminate a franchise agreement under certain circumstances including the failure by franchisees to uphold quality standards there can be no assurance that such remedy will be available or sufficient to prevent harm to our brand and protect our intellectual property 

  

as of january 2 2022 we had 735 us franchisees operating 6185 us stores as of that same date 22 of these franchisees each owned and operated more than 50 us stores including our largest us franchisee who owned and operated 177 stores and the average us franchisee owned and operated approximately eight stores our international master franchisees are generally responsible for the development of significantly more stores than our us franchisees as a result our international operations are more closely tied to the success of a smaller number of franchisees than our us operations as of january 2 2022 our largest international master franchisee operated 3229 stores in 10 markets which accounted for approximately 26 of our total international store count our us and international franchisees may not operate their franchises successfully if one or more of our key franchisees were to become insolvent or otherwise were unable or unwilling to pay us our royalties or other amounts owed our business and results of operations would be adversely affected 

  

  

we may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property which could harm the value of our brand and branded products and adversely affect our business 

 

we depend in large part on our brand and branded products and believe that they are very important to our business we rely on a combination of trademarks copyrights trade secrets and similar intellectual property rights to protect our brand and branded products the success of our business depends on our continued ability to use our existing trademarks in order to capitalize on our name recognition increase brand awareness and further develop our branded products in both us and international markets we have registered certain trademarks and have other trademark applications pending in the us and foreign jurisdictions not all of the trademarks that we currently use have been registered in all of the countries in which we do business and they may never be registered in all of these countries some countries’ laws do not protect unregistered trademarks at all or make them more difficult to enforce and third parties may have filed for “domino’s” or similar marks in countries where domino’s has not registered its brand accordingly we may not be able to adequately protect our trademarks everywhere in the world and our use of these trademarks may result in liability for trademark infringement trademark dilution or unfair competition all of the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property globally may not be adequate in addition the laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the us we may from time to time be required to institute or defend litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights or to protect our trade secrets such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could negatively affect our sales profitability and prospects regardless of whether we are able to successfully enforce our rights 

 

the occurrence of cyber incidents or a deficiency in cybersecurity could negatively impact our business by causing a disruption to our operations a compromise or corruption of confidential information or damage to our employee and business relationships any of which could subject us to loss and harm our brand 

 

a cyber incident is considered to be any adverse event that threatens the confidentiality integrity or availability of information resources more specifically a cyber incident is an intentional attack or an unintentional event that can include gaining unauthorized access to systems to disrupt operations corrupt data or steal confidential information about customers franchisees suppliers or employees many retailers and other companies have recently experienced serious cyber incidents and breaches of their information technology systems as our reliance on technology has increased so have the risks posed to our systems both internal and those we have outsourced and we may further be negatively impacted to the extent outdated or legacy systems cease to function appropriately we have in the past been and in the future may also be subject to negative impacts to our business caused by cyber incidents relating to our thirdparty service providers or the service providers of those third parties or our franchisees 

 

the three primary risks that could directly result from the occurrence of a cyber incident include operational interruption damage to our relationships with customers franchisees and employees and private data exposure including payment card or other financial data in addition to maintaining insurance coverage to address cyber incidents we have also implemented processes procedures and controls to help mitigate these risks however our cyber insurance coverage may not fully cover all of the costs associated with a cyber incident and these measures as well as our increased awareness of the risk of a cyber incident do not guarantee that our reputation and financial results will not be materially and adversely affected by such an incident 

 

our and our franchisees’ operations depend upon our ability and the ability of franchisees thirdparty service providers and the service providers of those third parties as well as franchisees’ thirdparty service providers and the service providers of those third parties to protect computer equipment and systems against damage from theft fire power loss telecommunications failure and other catastrophic or unanticipated events as well as internal and external security incidents viruses denialofservice attacks phishing attacks ransomware attacks and other intentional or unintentional disruptions a significant portion of our retail sales depends on the continuing operation of our information technology and communications systems including domino’s pulse™ our online and mobile ordering platforms and our credit card processing systems the failure of these systems to operate effectively stemming from maintenance problems upgrading or transitioning to new platforms a compromise in our security or other unanticipated problems has at times in the past and in the future could result in interruptions to or delays in our and our franchisees’ operations some of our systems are not fully redundant and our system’s disaster recovery planning cannot account for all eventualities the occurrence of a natural disaster intentional sabotage or other unanticipated problems could result in lengthy interruptions in service 

  

  

  

in addition the implementation of technology changes and upgrades to maintain and upgrade our systems errors or vulnerabilities in our systems or damage to or failure of our systems including because of systems becoming obsolete could result in interruptions in our services and noncompliance with certain laws or regulations which could reduce our sales revenues and profits and damage our business and brand furthermore as a result of the covid19 pandemic certain of our employees have been required to work from home for an extended period of time the significant increase in remote working particularly for an extended period of time could exacerbate certain risks to our business including an increased risk of cyber incidents and improper dissemination of personal or confidential information because we and our franchisees accept electronic forms of payment from customers including credit cards our business requires the collection and retention of customer data including sensitive financial data and other personally identifiable information in various information systems that we and our franchisees maintain and in those maintained by third parties with whom we and our franchisees contract to provide payment processing a weakness in such third party’s systems or software products or in the systems or software products in the service providers of those third parties may provide a mechanism for a cyber threat in recent years a significant number of companies have experienced security data breaches in which customer information was stolen through vendor access channels while we select our thirdparty suppliers carefully cyberattacks and security data breaches at a payment processing contractor could compromise confidential information or adversely affect our ability to deliver products and services to our customers these problems could negatively affect our results of operations and remediation could result in significant unplanned capital investments 

  

we also maintain important internal company data such as personally identifiable information about our employees and franchisees and information relating to our operations in addition more than half of all global retail sales in 2021 were derived from digital channels primarily through our online ordering website and mobile applications where customers enter personally identifiable information that we retain our use and retention of personally identifiable information is regulated by foreign federal and state laws and regulations as well as by certain thirdparty agreements for example the court of justice of the european union invalidated the us – eu privacy shield framework which was a commonly relied upon mechanism for exchanging personal data from the european union to the us in the july 16 2020 “schrems ii” decision case c31118 data protection commissioner v facebook ireland and maximillian schrems and the state of california has adopted the california privacy rights act of 2020 an amendment to the california consumer privacy act both of which may require companies to change their handling of personal data in addition the state of new york promulgated the new york shield act which imposed obligations on businesses to implement physical administrative and technical security measures to protect personal data by the march 21 2020 effective date as privacy and information security laws and regulations change we may incur additional costs to ensure that we remain in compliance with those laws and regulations and our current and future planned uses of personal and other data may be adversely affected by future adopted privacy and information security laws regulations and rulings if our security and information systems are compromised or if we our employees or franchisees fail to comply with these laws regulations or contract terms or to successfully implement processes related to requirements laws and regulations governing cyber incidents could require us to notify customers employees or other groups and could result in adverse publicity loss of sales and cash flows increased fees payable to third parties and fines penalties or remediation and other costs that could adversely affect our reputation business and results of operations any other material disruption or other adverse event affecting one or more of our digital ordering platforms including for instance power loss technological or systems failures user error or cyberattacks could similarly result in adverse publicity loss of sales and cash flows and other costs which could in turn materially and adversely affect our reputation business and results of operations 

 

we cannot predict the impact that new or improved technologies in general alternative methods of delivery including autonomous vehicle delivery or changes in consumer or employee behavior facilitated by these technologies and alternative methods of delivery will have on our business 

 

advances in technologies in general or alternative methods of delivery including advances in digital ordering technology and autonomous vehicle delivery or certain changes in consumer behavior driven by these or other technologies and methods of delivery could have a negative effect on our business and market position moreover technology and consumer offerings continue to develop and we expect that new or enhanced technologies and consumer offerings will be available in the future we may pursue certain of those technologies and consumer offerings if we believe they offer a sustainable customer proposition and can be successfully integrated into our business model however we cannot predict consumer acceptance of these delivery channels or their impact on our business in addition our competitors some of whom have greater resources financial or otherwise than we do may be able to benefit from changes in technologies or consumer acceptance of alternative methods of delivery which could harm our competitive position 

  

  

there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully respond to changing consumer preferences including with respect to new technologies and alternative methods of delivery or to effectively adjust our product mix service offerings and marketing and merchandising initiatives for products and services that address and anticipate advances in technology and market trends alternative methods of delivery may also impact the potential labor pool from which we recruit our delivery experts and could reduce the available supply of labor if we are not able to successfully respond to these challenges our business market share financial condition and operating results could be materially and adversely affected 

  

we are subject to a variety of additional risks associated with our franchisees 

 

our franchise system subjects us to a number of additional risks any one of which may impact our ability to collect royalty payments and fees from our franchisees may harm the goodwill associated with our brand andor may materially and adversely impact our business and results of operations such risks may also apply to us as owners of stores these risks include but are not limited to 

  

• those relating to the application of local state federal and foreign bankruptcy laws and other applicable laws governing creditors’ rights generally and the impact such laws could have on our ability to collect payments and fees under applicable franchise agreements 

• those relating to franchisees that are operating entities which generally are not limitedpurpose entities including business credit financial and other risks in addition to risks related to unions 

• those relating to franchisee changes in control and succession in general and the ability to find acceptable successors who would be able to perform a former franchisee’s obligations under applicable franchise agreements or successfully operate impacted stores in the event of a change of control or other succession event 

• those relating to franchisee insurance including the inadequacy of or inability to obtain insurance coverage losses in excess of policy limits or payments not being made on a timely basis extraordinary hazards not being subject to coverage or only being subject to coverage at prohibitively high rates or third parties seeking to recover losses from us to the extent those losses experienced by such third parties are either not covered by the franchisee’s insurance or exceed the policy limits of the franchisee’s insurance 

• those relating to instances of termination of or default under a franchisee’s franchise agreement or the nonrenewal thereof at the end of such agreement’s expiration date and the corresponding impact on the franchisee’s or our operations 

• those relating to product liability exposure or noncompliance with health and safety regulations and the impact such events could have on a franchisee’s ability to make payments under applicable franchise agreements on us if an aggrieved party seeks to recover their losses from us and on our brand’s reputation 

• the imposition of injunctive relief fines damage awards or capital expenditures under the americans with disabilities act of 1990 as amended or other laws or regulations that could adversely affect the ability of a franchisee to make payments under applicable franchise agreements 

• litigation involving franchisees including litigation involving us or litigation involving a thirdparty directed at a franchisee which could decrease the ability of a defendantfranchisee to make its royalty payments and divert our resources regardless of whether the allegations in such litigation are valid or whether we are liable and 

• those relating to the reliance of a franchised store business on its franchisees and the nature of franchisees in general including the retention of franchisees especially including our topperforming franchisees in the future or our ability to attract retain and motivate sufficient numbers of franchisees of the same caliber in the future as well as our ability to maintain a positive and constructive relationship with our franchisees 

 

our current insurance coverage may not be adequate insurance premiums for such coverage may increase and we may not be able to obtain insurance at acceptable rates or at all 

 

for certain periods prior to december 1998 and for periods after december 2001 we maintain insurance coverage for workers’ compensation general liability and owned and nonowned automobile liabilities we are generally responsible for up to 20 million per occurrence under these retention programs for workers’ compensation and general liability depending on policy year and line of coverage we are generally responsible for up to between 500000 and 55 million per occurrence under these retention programs for owned and nonowned automobile liabilities depending on policy year and line of coverage 

  

  

total insurance limits under these retention programs vary depending upon the period covered and range up to 1100 million per occurrence for general liability and owned and nonowned automobile liabilities and up to the applicable statutory limits for workers’ compensation these insurance policies may not be adequate to protect us from liabilities that we incur in our business in addition in the future our insurance premiums may increase and we may not be able to obtain similar levels of insurance on reasonable terms or at all any such inadequacy of or inability to obtain insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

environmental social and governance matters may impact our business and reputation 

 

increasingly in addition to the importance of their financial performance companies are being judged by their performance on a variety of environmental social and governance “esg” matters which are considered to contribute to the longterm sustainability of companies’ performance a variety of organizations measure the performance of companies on such esg topics and the results of these assessments are widely publicized in addition major institutional investors have publicly emphasized the importance of such esg matters to their investment decisions further in december 2021 we announced our goal to set and reach science based targets by 2035 and achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050 execution of these strategies and achievement of these goals are subject to risks and uncertainties many of which are outside of our control and may prove to be more costly than we anticipate these risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to our ability to execute our strategies and achieve our goals within the currently projected costs and the expected timeframes unforeseen design operational and technological difficulties the outcome of research efforts and future technology developments the success of our collaboration with franchisees and other third parties and the actions of competitors and competitive pressures there is no assurance that we will be able to successfully execute our strategies and achieve our goals failure to achieve our goals could damage our reputation and customer investor and other stakeholder relationships such conditions could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition as well as on our stock price there also has been increased political focus including by us and foreign governmental authorities on environmental sustainability matters such as climate change the reduction of greenhouse gases and water consumption legislative regulatory or other efforts to combat climate change or other esg concerns could also result in new or more stringent forms of oversight and expanding mandatory and voluntary reporting diligence and disclosure which could increase costs bring additional focus and further impact our business results of operations and financial condition any failure or perceived failure by us to manage esg issues successfully could have a material adverse effect on our reputation and on our business results of operations financial condition or stock price including the sustainability of our business over time 

  

risks related to our indebtedness 

 

our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our business and limit our ability to plan for or respond to changes in our business 

 

we have a substantial amount of indebtedness as of january 2 2022 our consolidated total indebtedness was approximately 507 billion we may also incur additional debt which would not be prohibited under the terms of our current securitized debt agreements our substantial indebtedness could have important consequences for our business and our shareholders for example it could 

  

• make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our debt agreements 

• increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions 

• require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow for other purposes and 

• limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and the industry in which we operate thereby placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our peers that may have less debt 

further our variable funding notes bear interest at fluctuating interest rates that in certain circumstances is based on the london interbank offered rate “libor” and there is currently uncertainty around whether libor will continue to exist going forward following completion of a consultation regarding cessation of libor settings in january 2021 and receipt from a majority of the panel banks of notices of future departure with respect to each libor setting ice benchmark administration limited the administrator for libor confirmed its intention to cease the publication of the oneweek and twomonth us dollar libor settings immediately after december 31 2021 and the remaining us dollar libor settings immediately following the libor publication on june 30 2023 

  

  

the financial conduct authority the “fca” also stated that while most available tenors for us dollar libor will be available for legacy contracts after december 31 2021 such tenors may not be used in new contracts the fca will consult regarding the use of new powers to be granted by the eu and uk governments which would permit the fca to require panel banks to continue to publish certain libor settings on a “synthetic” basis until the end of 2022 including the use of such powers for onemonth threemonth and sixmonth us dollar libor settings however the fca also stated that any continued publication of “synthetic” libor would not be representative and would only be for use in legacy contracts in addition the federal reserve board the office of the comptroller of the currency and the federal deposit insurance corporation had previously released a statement that i encouraged banks to cease entering into new contracts that use us dollar libor as a reference rate as soon as practicable and in any event by december 31 2021 ii indicated that new contracts entered into before december 31 2021 should either utilize a reference rate other than us dollar libor or have robust fallback language that includes a clearly defined alternative reference rate after the discontinuation of us dollar libor and iii explained that extending the publication of certain us dollar libor tenors until june 30 2023 would allow most legacy us dollar libor contracts to mature before libor begins experiencing disruptions in the united states the us federal reserve in conjunction with the alternative reference rates committee a steering committee comprised of large us financial institutions is considering replacing libor with a new index calculated by shortterm repurchase agreements backed by treasury securities called the secured overnight financing rate “sofr” 

  

our 2021 variable funding notes loan documents contemplate a transition from libor to sofr in the event that libor ceases to exist because the composition and characteristics of sofr are not the same as those of libor in such event there can be no assurance that sofr will perform the same way libor would have at any given time or for any applicable period and how markets will respond to sofr or other alternative reference rates as the transition away from the libor occurs as anticipated as a result our interest expense could increase in which event we may have difficulties making interest payments and funding our other fixed costs and our available cash flow for general corporate requirements may be adversely affected 

  

in addition the financial and other covenants we agreed to with our lenders may limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness make investments pay dividends and engage in other transactions and the leverage may cause potential lenders to be less willing to loan funds to us in the future our failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default that if not cured or waived could result in the acceleration of repayment of all of our indebtedness 

 

downgrades in our credit ratings could impact our ability to access capital and materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

our debt is rated by credit rating agencies these agencies may downgrade their credit ratings for us based on the performance of our business our capital strategies or their overall view of our industry there can be no assurance that any rating assigned to our currently outstanding indebtedness will remain in effect for any given period of time or that any such ratings will not be lowered suspended or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if in that agency’s judgment circumstances so warrant a downgrade of our credit ratings could among other things increase our cost of borrowing limit our ability to access capital result in more restrictive covenants in agreements governing the terms of any future indebtedness that we may incur including restrictions on our ability to pay dividends or repurchase shares or require us to provide collateral for future borrowings and thereby adversely impact our business and results of operations 

 

we may be unable to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our significant debt service obligations which would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

 

our ability to make principal and interest payments on and to refinance our indebtedness will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future this to a certain extent is subject to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control if our business does not generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the amounts projected or at all or if future borrowings are not available to us under our variable funding notes in amounts sufficient to fund our other liquidity needs our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected if we cannot generate sufficient cash flow from operations to make scheduled principal amortization and interest payments on our debt obligations in the future we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity sell assets delay capital expenditures or seek additional equity if we are unable to refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all or to affect any other action relating to our indebtedness on satisfactory terms or at all our business may be harmed 

  

  

the terms of our securitized debt financing of certain of our whollyowned subsidiaries have restrictive terms and our failure to comply with any of these terms could put us in default which would have an adverse effect on our business and prospects 

 

unless and until we repay all outstanding borrowings under our securitized debt we will remain subject to the restrictive terms of these borrowings the securitized debt under which certain of our whollyowned subsidiaries issued and guaranteed fixed rate notes and variable funding senior revolving notes contain a number of covenants with the most significant financial covenant being a debt service coverage calculation these covenants limit the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to among other things 

  

• sell assets 

• alter the business we conduct and engage in mergers acquisitions and other business combinations 

• declare dividends or redeem or repurchase capital stock 

• incur assume or permit to exist additional indebtedness or guarantees 

• make loans and investments 

• incur liens and 

• enter into transactions with affiliates 

  

the securitized debt also requires us to maintain specified financial ratios at the end of each fiscal quarter these restrictions could affect our ability to pay dividends or repurchase shares of our common stock our ability to meet these financial ratios can be affected by events beyond our control and we may not satisfy such a test a breach of this covenant could result in a rapid amortization event or default under the securitized debt if amounts owed under the securitized debt are accelerated because of a default under the securitized debt and we are unable to pay such amounts the investors may have the right to assume control of substantially all of the securitized assets 

 

during the term following issuance the outstanding senior notes will accrue interest in accordance with the terms of the debt agreements additionally our senior notes have original scheduled principal payments of 515 million in each of 2022 2023 and 2024 117 billion in 2025 393 million in 2026 131 billion in 2027 8115 million in 2028 6259 million in 2029 100 million in 2030 and 9050 million in 2031 in accordance with our debt agreements the payment of principal on the outstanding senior notes may be suspended if the leverage ratio for the company is less than or equal to 50x total debt as defined to adjusted ebitda as defined in the indenture governing our securitized debt and no catchup provisions are applicable 

 

if we are unable to refinance or repay amounts under the securitized debt prior to the expiration of the term our cash flow would be directed to the repayment of the securitized debt and other than a weekly management fee sufficient to cover minimal selling general and administrative expenses would not be available for operating our business no assurance can be given that any refinancing or additional financing will be possible when needed or that we will be able to negotiate acceptable terms in addition our access to capital is affected by prevailing conditions in the financial and capital markets and other factors beyond our control there can be no assurance that market conditions will be favorable at the times that we require new or additional financing 

 

the indenture governing the securitized debt will restrict the cash flow from the entities subject to the securitization to any of our other entities and upon the occurrence of certain events cash flow would be further restricted in the event that a rapid amortization event occurs under the indenture including without limitation upon an event of default under the indenture or the failure to repay the securitized debt at the end of its term the funds available to us would be reduced or eliminated which would in turn reduce our ability to operate or grow our business 

  

regulatory legal and compliance risks 

 

we face risks of litigation investigations enforcement actions and negative publicity from customers franchisees suppliers employees regulators and others in the ordinary course of business which could divert our financial and management resources litigation investigations enforcement actions or publicity may adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations 

 

claims of illness or injury relating to food quality or food handling are common in the food service industry and vehicular accidents and injuries occur in the food delivery business we are currently subject to these types of claims and have been subject to these types of claims in the past claims within our industry of improper supplier actions also occasionally arise that if made against one of our suppliers could potentially damage our brand image 

  

  

in addition class action lawsuits have been filed and may continue to be filed against various qsr alleging among other things that qsrs have failed to disclose the health risks associated with highfat foods and that qsr marketing practices have encouraged obesity state attorney general offices or other regulators have initiated and may in the future initiate investigations or enforcement actions against us in addition to decreasing our sales and profitability and diverting our management resources adverse publicity resulting from such allegations may materially and adversely affect us and our brand regardless of whether such allegations are valid or whether we are liable and could result in a substantial settlement fine penalty or judgment against us 

 

further we may be subject to employee franchisee and other claims in the future based on among other things discrimination harassment working and safety conditions wrongful termination and wage expense reimbursement rest break and meal break issues including claims relating to overtime compensation we have been and continue to be subject to these types of claims if one or more of these claims were to be successful or if there is a significant increase in the number of these claims or if we receive significant negative publicity our business financial condition and operating results could be harmed 

we and our franchisees are subject to extensive laws and government regulation and requirements issued by other groups and our failure to comply with existing or increased laws and regulations could adversely affect our business and operating results 

 

we are subject to numerous federal state local and foreign laws and regulations as well as requirements issued by other groups including those relating to 

 

• the preparation sale and labeling of food 

• building and zoning requirements and environmental protection 

• labor and employment including minimum wage overtime insurance discrimination and other labor requirements as well as working and safety conditions 

• franchise arrangements 

• taxation 

• antitrust 

• payment card industry standards and requirements and 

• information privacy and consumer protection 

 

we are subject to an ftc rule and to various state and foreign laws that govern the offer and sale of franchises these laws regulate various aspects of the franchise relationship including terminations and the refusal to renew franchises the failure to comply with these laws and regulations in any jurisdiction or to obtain required government approvals could result in a ban or temporary suspension on future franchise sales fines or other penalties or require us to make offers of rescission or restitution any of which could adversely affect our business 

 

we and our franchisees face various regulatory and legislative efforts to enforce employment laws such as efforts to categorize franchisors as the coemployers or joint employers of their franchisees’ employees or to aggregate individual franchised businesses and classify them as large employers for minimum wage or other employmentrelated purposes in august 2015 the national labor relations board nlrb adopted a new and broader standard for determining when two or more otherwise unrelated employers may be found to be a joint employer of the same employees under the national labor relations act the nlrb issued a final rule which became effective april 27 2020 that reinstates the standard that was in place before august 2015 

in december 2019 the nlrb directed an administrative law judge to approve settlement agreements rather than rejecting the settlement and allowing the claims asserting that the franchisor should be the joint employer of its franchisees’ employees to proceed in a decision related to another franchise system however an appeal of that decision is pending the national labor relations board nlrb announced on december 10 2021 that it will again revisit its joint employer standard if the august 2015 standard is restored or is adopted by other government agencies andor applied generally to franchise relationships it could cause us to be liable or held responsible for unfair labor practices and other violations of our franchisees and subject us to other liabilities and require us to conduct collective bargaining negotiations regarding employees of totally separate independent employers most notably our franchisees in such event our operating expenses may increase as a result of required modifications to our business practices increased litigation governmental investigations or proceedings administrative enforcement actions fines and civil liability 

  

  

additionally depending upon the outcome and application of certain legal proceedings pending or concluded in federal court in california involving the california wage and hour laws in another franchise system franchisors may be subject to claims that their franchisees should be treated as employees and not as independent contractors under the wage and hour laws of that state and potentially certain other states and localities with similar wage and hour laws further the california legislature recently enacted a statute known as assembly bill 5 ab5 which went into effect on january 1 2020 ab5 requires “gig economy” workers to be reclassified as employees instead of independent contractors however depending upon the application of ab5 franchisors in certain industries could be deemed to be covered by the statute in which event certain franchisees could be deemed employees of the franchisors while active efforts to narrow the reach of ab5 continue a bill sb 967 which was introduced specifically to exempt the relationship between a franchisor and franchisee from the scope of ab5 was not successful in the legislature on november 3 2020 the california electorate approved proposition 22 the effect of which is to exempt appbased transportation ride shares and delivery drivers from the application of ab5 by treating these workers as independent contractors rather than employees provided certain conditions are met the ballot measure does not affect how ab5 applies to other businesses and workers if misclassification claims are successful against or applied to a franchisor under ab5 or any other similar state law a franchisor could be liable to its franchisees and potentially their employees based the rights and remedies available to employees under such laws and thereafter have to treat its franchisees and their employees as the franchisor’s employees under these laws 

  

we and our franchisees are subject to the fair labor standards act of 1938 as amended the “fair labor standards act” which along with the family and medical leave act governs such matters as minimum wage and overtime requirements and other working conditions and various family leave mandates as well as a variety of other laws enacted or rules and regulations promulgated by federal state and local governmental authorities that govern these and other employment matters we and our franchisees have experienced and expect further increases in payroll expenses as a result of governmentmandated increases in the minimum wage and although such increases are not currently expected to be material there may be material increases in the future enactment and enforcement of various federal state and local laws rules and regulations on immigration and labor organizations may adversely impact the availability and costs of labor for domino’s and franchisees’ stores in a particular area or across the united states in addition thirdparty suppliers may be affected by higher minimum wage standards which may increase the price of goods and services they supply to us such increased expenses may cause our franchisees to exit the business or cause us to reduce the number of companyowned stores or otherwise adversely affect the amount of royalty payments and license fees we receive on january 12 2020 the us department of labor announced a final rule to update and clarify the definition of joint employer under the fair labor standards act under the final rule the general test for assessing whether a party can be deemed a joint employer would be based upon whether that party i hires or fires the employee ii supervises and controls the employee’s work schedule or conditions of employment iii determines the employee’s rate and method of payment and iv maintains the employee’s employment records in the final rule the department of labor describes instances in which joint employment would not be more or less likely to be found to exist under the fair labor standards act which according to the department of labor includes the relationships that exist under the typical franchise business model this rule may reduce a franchisor’s risk of liability that currently exists under the joint employer standard now in effect under the fair labor standards act though ultimately the facts specific to the franchisorfranchisee model at issue would be considered when determining liability on september 8 2020 a federal district court struck down a significant portion of the final rule and an appeal of that decision is currently pending on july 29 2021 the current administration’s department of labor issued a final rule rescinding the 2020 rule the department of labor may revert to the more expansive interpretation of joint employer that existed prior to the adoption of the 2020 rule andor interpretations that could result in franchisors being held liable or responsible for fair labor standards act violations by their franchisees the rules of the department of labor are separate from the joint employer standard under the national labor relations act or as described above potential liability as a joint employer under the national labor relations act 

  

certain governmental authorities and private litigants have recently asserted claims against franchisors including us for provisions in our prior franchise agreements that restrict franchisees from soliciting or hiring the employees of other franchisees or the applicable franchisor claims against franchisors for such clauses include allegations that these clauses violate state and federal antitrust and unfair practices laws by restricting the free movement of employees of franchisees andor franchisor including the employees of companyowned stores thereby depressing the wages of those employees 

  

  

the patient protection and affordable care act as amended the “affordable care act” requires employers such as us to provide health insurance for all qualifying employees or pay penalties for not providing coverage the majority of the increases in these costs began in 2015 and while the incremental costs of this program have not been material to us to date we cannot predict what effect these costs will have on our results of operations and financial position or the effects of the affordable care act on some of our larger franchisees modifications to or repeal of all or certain provisions of the affordable care act are also possible changes in tax laws or tax policy more broadly increases in the enacted tax rates adverse outcomes in connection with tax audits in any jurisdiction or any change in the pronouncements relating to accounting for income taxes could also impact our financial condition and results of operations we may also become subject to legislation or regulation seeking to tax andor regulate highfat foods foods with high sugar and salt content or foods otherwise deemed to be “unhealthy” and our capital expenditures could increase due to remediation and compliance measures related to these laws or regulations 

  

adverse government regulations and enforcement efforts or noncompliance by us or our franchisees with any of the foregoing laws and regulations could lead to various claims or governmental or judicial fines sanctions or other enforcement measures which could negatively impact our business 

  

market and general risks 

 

fluctuations in value of the us dollar in relation to other currencies may lead to lower revenues and earnings 

 

exchange rate fluctuations could have an adverse effect on our results of operations international franchise royalties and fees represented approximately 68 61 and 67 of our total revenues in 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively a majority of which were denominated in foreign currencies we also operate dough manufacturing and distribution facilities in canada which generate revenues denominated in canadian dollars sales made by franchise stores outside the us are denominated in the currency of the country in which the store is located and this currency could become less valuable in us dollars as a result of exchange rate fluctuations unfavorable currency fluctuations could lead to increased prices to customers outside the us or lower profitability to our franchisees outside the us or could result in lower revenues for us on a us dollar basis from such customers and franchisees a hypothetical 10 adverse change in the foreign currency rates in our international markets would have resulted in a negative impact on international royalty revenues of approximately 265 million in 2021 

 

our annual and quarterly financial results are subject to significant fluctuations depending on various factors many of which are beyond our control and if we fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors our stock price may decline significantly or be subject to significant fluctuations 

 

our annual and quarterly financial results including our sales and operating results can vary significantly from quartertoquarter and yeartoyear depending on various factors many of which are beyond our control these factors include among other things 

  

• variations in the timing and volume of our sales and our franchisees’ sales including same store sales 

• the timing of expenditures in anticipation of future sales 

• changes in the cost or availability of our ingredients or labor 

• planned or actual changes to our capital or debt structure 

• strategic actions by us or our competitors such as sales promotions acquisitions or restructurings 

• changes in our dividend policy or any share repurchase program 

• significant litigation or legislation or other regulatory developments affecting us or our industry 

• changes in competitive and economic conditions generally as well as general market conditions and 

• foreign currency exposure 

  

as a result our operational performance may decline quickly and significantly in response to changes in order patterns or rapid decreases in demand for our products any such decline may cause us and our franchisees to experience lower sales revenue we anticipate that fluctuations in operating results will continue in the future and such fluctuations may result in significant fluctuations or a significant decline in our stock price 

 

actions of activist investors could negatively impact our business and the value of our stock price 

  

publiclytraded companies have increasingly become subject to activist investor campaigns responding to actions of an activist investor may be a significant distraction for our management and staff and could require us to expend significant time and resources including legal fees and potential proxy solicitation expenses any of these conditions could materially and adversely affect our financial performance

litigation is subject to many uncertainties and the outcome of individual litigated matters is not predictable with assurance these matters referenced above could be decided unfavorably to us and could require us to pay damages or make other expenditures in amounts or a range of amounts that cannot be estimated with accuracy in management’s opinion these matters individually and in the aggregate should not have a significant adverse effect on the financial condition of the company and the established accruals adequately provide for the estimated resolution of such claims 

  

while we may occasionally be party to large claims including class action suits we do not believe that any existing matters individually or in the aggregate will materially affect our financial position results of operations or cash flows

description of the business 

  

domino’s is the largest pizza company in the world with more than 18800 locations in over 90 markets around the world as of january 2 2022 and operates two distinct service models within its stores with a significant business in both delivery and carryout  founded in 1960 our roots are in convenient pizza delivery while a significant amount of our sales also come from carryout customers although we are a highlyrecognized global brand we focus on value while serving neighborhoods locally through our large network of franchise owners and companyowned stores 

  

our business model is straightforward domino’s stores handcraft and serve quality food at a competitive price with easy ordering access and efficient service enhanced by our technological innovations our handtossed dough is made fresh and distributed to stores around the world by us and our franchisees 

  

domino’s generates revenues and earnings by charging royalties and fees to our independent franchisees we also generate revenues and earnings by selling food equipment and supplies to franchisees primarily in the us and canada and by operating a number of companyowned stores in the us franchisees profit by selling pizza and other complementary items to their local customers in our international markets we generally grant geographical rights to the domino’s pizza brand to master franchisees these master franchisees are charged with developing their geographical area and they can profit by subfranchising and selling food and equipment to those subfranchisees as well as by running pizza stores directly we believe that everyone in the system can benefit including the end consumer who can feed their family conveniently and economically 

  

our financial results are driven largely by retail sales at our franchise and companyowned stores changes in retail sales are driven by changes in same store sales and store counts we monitor both of these metrics very closely as they directly impact our revenues and profits and we strive to consistently increase both metrics retail sales drive royalty payments from franchisees as well as companyowned store and supply chain revenues retail sales are primarily impacted by the strength of the domino’s pizza brand the results of our extensive advertising through various media channels the impact of technological innovation and digital ordering our ability to execute our strong and proven business model and the overall global economic environment 

  

our business model can yield strong returns for our franchise owners and our companyowned stores it can also yield significant cash flow to us through a consistent franchise royalty payment and supply chain revenue stream with moderate capital expenditures we have historically returned cash to shareholders through dividend payments and share repurchases since becoming a publiclytraded company in 2004 we believe we have a proven business model for success which includes leading with technology service and product innovation and leveraging our global scale which has historically provided strong returns for our shareholders 

  

critical accounting estimates 

 

the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of these financial statements requires our management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis our management evaluates its estimates including those related to longlived assets casualty insurance reserves and income taxes we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from those estimates and changes in estimates could materially affect our results of operations and financial condition for any particular period 

  

  

we believe that our most critical accounting estimates are 

  

longlived assets 

  

we record longlived assets including property plant and equipment and capitalized software at cost for acquisitions of franchise operations we estimate the fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired based on physical inspection of assets historical experience and other information available to us regarding the acquisition we depreciate and amortize longlived assets using useful lives determined by us based on historical experience and other information available to us our estimates of the useful lives of our longlived assets have not changed during the periods presented we evaluate the potential impairment of longlived assets at least annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable our periodic evaluation is based on various analyses including on an annual basis the projection of undiscounted cash flows if we determine that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable we compare the net carrying value of the asset group to the undiscounted net cash flows to be generated from the use and eventual disposition of that asset group for companyowned stores we perform related impairment tests on an operating market basis which we have determined to be the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of other cash flows if the carrying amount of a longlived asset exceeds the amount of the expected future undiscounted cash flows of that asset we estimate the fair value of the asset if the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset an impairment loss is recognized and the asset is written down to its estimated fair value 

  

we have not made any significant changes in the methodology used to project the future market cash flows of companyowned stores during the years presented same store sales fluctuations and the rates at which operating costs will fluctuate in the future are key factors in determining projected cash flows used to evaluate recoverability of the related assets if our same store sales significantly decline or if operating costs increase and we are unable to recover these costs the carrying value of our companyowned stores by market may be unrecoverable and we may be required to recognize an impairment charge there were no triggering events in 2021 2020 or 2019 and accordingly we did not record any impairment losses on longlived assets in 2021 2020 and 2019 

  

casualty insurance reserves 

  

for certain periods prior to december 1998 and for periods after december 2001 we maintain insurance coverage for workers’ compensation general liability and owned and nonowned auto liabilities we are generally responsible for up to 20 million per occurrence under these retention programs for workers’ compensation and general liability depending on policy year and line of coverage we are generally responsible for up to between 500000 and 55 million per occurrence under these retention programs for owned and nonowned automobile liabilities depending on policy year and line of coverage the related insurance reserves are based on undiscounted independent actuarial estimates which are based on historical information along with assumptions about future events there is inherent uncertainty in the ultimate cost for known claims under our insurance coverages and for incidents that have occurred that will be subject to a claim but have yet to be reported to us analyses of historical trends and actuarial valuation methods are utilized to estimate the ultimate claim costs for claims incurred as of the balance sheet date and for claims incurred but not yet reported when estimating these liabilities several factors are considered including the severity duration and frequency of claims legal cost associated with claims healthcare trends and projected inflation 

  

our methodology for determining our exposure has remained consistent throughout the years presented management believes that the various assumptions developed and actuarial methods used to determine our casualty insurance reserves are reasonable and provide meaningful data that management uses to make its best estimate of our exposure to these risks changes in assumptions for such factors as medical costs and legal actions as well as changes in actual experience could cause our estimates to change in the near term which could result in an increase or decrease in the related expense in future periods a 10 change in our casualty insurance liability at january 2 2022 would have affected our income before provision for income taxes by approximately 56 million in 2021 we had accruals for casualty insurance reserves of 565 million and 546 million at january 2 2022 and january 3 2021 respectively 

  

  

  

income taxes 

  

the us federal statutory income tax rate was 21 in each of 2021 2020 and 2019 our federal income tax provision calculated based on the federal statutory rate was 1314 million 1166 million and 1014 million in 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively 

  

we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities we measure deferred taxes using current enacted tax rates that will apply in the years in which we expect the temporary differences to be recovered or paid judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes related reserves and deferred taxes these include establishing a valuation allowance related to the ability to realize certain deferred tax assets if necessary on an ongoing basis management will assess whether it remains more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized our accounting for deferred taxes represents our best estimate of future events except with respect to certain foreign tax credits and interest deductibility in separately filed states our deferred tax assets assume that we will generate sufficient taxable income in specific tax jurisdictions based on our estimates and assumptions as of january 2 2022 and january 3 2021 we had total foreign tax credits of 102 million and 66 million respectively each of which were fully offset with a corresponding valuation allowance we also had valuation allowances related to interest deductibility in separately filed states of 12 million and 10 million as of january 2 2022 and january 3 2021 respectively we believe our remaining deferred tax assets will be realized changes in our current estimates due to unanticipated events could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

  

fiscal 2021 highlights 

  

• global retail sales excluding foreign currency impact which includes total retail sales at companyowned and franchised stores worldwide increased 89 as compared to 2020 us retail sales increased 43 and international retail sales excluding foreign currency impact increased 139 as compared to 2020 

• same store sales increased 35 in our us stores and increased 80 in our international stores 

• our revenues increased 58 

• our income from operations increased 75 

• our net income increased 39 

• our diluted earnings per share increased 93 

• the inclusion of the 53 rd week in 2020 negatively impacted our results as compared to the prior year 

  

during 2021 we experienced global retail sales growth and us and international same store sales growth we believe our commitment to value convenience quality and new products continues to keep consumers engaged with the brand we launched our newest side item in the us domino’s ovenbaked dips in three unique flavors including cheesy marinara five cheese and baked apple to pair with our domino’s bread twists 

  

same store sales in the us continue to be positively affected by changes in consumer ordering behavior observed since the onset of the covid19 pandemic but have been pressured in part in recent quarters due to labor shortages affecting store hours and staffing levels in many of our markets as well as a waning in the level of economic stimulus activity in fiscal 2021 in the us as compared to the prior year our strong international same store sales performance continued with 112 straight quarters of positive international same store sales we also continued to experience sustained increases in retail sales during fiscal 2021 resulting from evolving consumer trends as well as the reopening and resumption of normal store hours and operating procedures at certain of our international franchised stores that had been temporarily closed or affected by changes in operating procedures and store hours for portions of fiscal 2020 as a result of the covid19 pandemic our us and international same store sales results continue to be impacted by our fortressing strategy which includes increasing store concentration in certain markets where we compete as well as from aggressive competitive activity 

  

during 2021 we continued our global expansion with the opening of 1204 net stores we had 205 net stores open in the us comprised of 214 store openings and 9 closures we had 999 net stores open internationally comprised of 1094 store openings and 95 closures 

  

we remained focused on improving the customer experience through our technology initiatives including through our gps delivery tracking technology which allows customers to monitor the progress of their food from the preparation stages to the time it is in the oven to the time it arrives at their doors additionally we offer contactless carryout nationwide – via domino’s carside delivery ®  which customers can choose when placing a prepaid online order our emphasis on technological innovation helped the domino’s system generate more than half of global retail sales from digital channels in 2021 overall we believe our global store growth strong sales emphasis on technology operations and marketing initiatives have combined to strengthen our brand 

  

  

statistical measures 

  

the tables below outline certain statistical measures we utilize to analyze our performance this historical data is not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for any future period 

  

global retail sales growth excluding foreign currency impact 

  

global retail sales growth excluding foreign currency impact is a commonly used statistical measure in the quickservice restaurant industry that is important to understanding performance global retail sales growth refers to total worldwide retail sales at companyowned and franchise stores we believe global retail sales information is useful in analyzing revenues because franchisees pay royalties and in the us advertising fees that are based on a percentage of franchise retail sales we review comparable industry global retail sales information to assess business trends and to track the growth of the domino’s pizza brand in addition supply chain revenues are directly impacted by changes in franchise retail sales in the us and canada retail sales for franchise stores are reported to us by our franchisees and are not included in our revenues global retail sales growth excluding foreign currency impact is calculated as the change of international local currency global retail sales against the comparable period of the prior year global retail sales growth in 2021 and 2020 reflect the impact of the 53 rd week in 2020 

  

   

same store sales growth 

  

same store sales growth is a commonly used statistical measure in the quickservice restaurant industry that is important to understanding performance same store sales growth is calculated for a given period by including only sales from stores that also had sales in the comparable weeks of both years international same store sales growth is calculated similarly to us same store sales growth changes in international same store sales are reported on a constant dollar basis which reflects changes in international local currency sales the 53 rd week in fiscal 2020 had no impact on reported same store sales growth amounts

consolidated revenues increased 2400 million or 58 in 2021 due primarily to higher global retail sales which resulted in higher supply chain revenues international franchise royalties and fees us franchise royalties and fees and us franchise advertising revenues these increases were partially offset by the inclusion of the 53 rd week in 2020 which positively impacted revenues in 2020 by an estimated 884 million these changes in revenues are described in more detail below 

 

  

  

us stores revenues 

  

   

us companyowned stores 

  

revenues from us companyowned store operations decreased 66 million or 14 in 2021 due primarily to an estimated 106 million impact of the 53 rd week in fiscal 2020 as well as a decrease in us companyowned same store sales us companyowned same store sales declined 36 in 2021 and increased 110 in 2020 these decreases in 2021 were partially offset by an increase in the average number of us companyowned stores open during the period resulting from net store growth 

  

us franchise royalties and fees 

  

revenues from us franchise royalties and fees increased 367 million or 73 in 2021 due primarily to higher same store sales and an increase in the average number of us franchised stores open during the period resulting from net store growth revenues were also benefited by approximately 30 million related to funding we provided to our franchisees for an effort to donate 10 million slices of pizza to people and organizations at the frontlines of the covid19 pandemic in the franchisees’ local communities during 2020 which did not recur in 2021 us franchise same store sales increased 39 in 2021 and increased 115 in 2020 us franchise royalties and fees further benefited from an increase in revenues from fees paid by franchisees for the use of our technology platforms these increases were partially offset by an estimated 114 million impact of the 53 rd week in fiscal 2020 

  

us franchise advertising 

  

revenues from us franchise advertising increased 173 million or 37 in 2021 due primarily to higher same store sales and an increase in the average number of us franchised stores open during the year resulting from net store growth these increases were partially offset by an estimated 104 million impact of the 53 rd week in fiscal 2020 as well as approximately 93 million in advertising incentives related to the domino’s surprise frees tm promotion in 2021 

  

supply chain 

  

supply chain revenues increased 1443 million or 60 in 2021 due primarily to higher volumes resulting from retail sales growth our market basket pricing to stores increased 33 during 2021  which resulted in an estimated 663 million increase in supply chain revenues  these increases were partially offset by an estimated 496 million impact of the 53 rd week in fiscal 2020 

  

international franchise royalties and fees

cost of sales  operating margin 

  

   

consolidated cost of sales consists primarily of us companyowned store and supply chain costs incurred to generate related revenues components of consolidated cost of sales primarily include food labor delivery and occupancy costs we estimate that the 53 rd week resulted in an increase of approximately 506 million to consolidated cost of sales in fiscal 2020 

  

consolidated operating margin which we define as revenues less cost of sales increased 937 million or 59 in 2021 due primarily to higher global franchise revenues and higher supply chain volumes franchise revenues do not have a cost of sales component so changes in these revenues have a disproportionate effect on the operating margin these increases were partially offset by an estimated 378 million impact on consolidated operating margin related to the 53 rd week in fiscal 2020 

  

as a percentage of revenues the consolidated operating margin was flat at 387 in 2021 and 2020 companyowned store operating margin increased 01 percentage points in 2021 and supply chain operating margin decreased 09 percentage points in 2021 these changes in operating margin are described in more detail below 

 

us companyowned stores operating margin 

  

   

us companyowned store operating margin which does not include other storelevel costs such as royalties and advertising decreased 11 million or 10 in 2021 due primarily to lower same store sales as well an estimated 32 million impact of the 53 rd week in 2020 higher food and occupancy costs also contributed to the decrease in us companyowned store operating margin these decreases were partially offset by lower labor costs as a percentage of store revenues the store operating margin increased 01 percentage points in 2021 these changes in operating margin as a percentage of revenues are discussed in more detail below 

  

• labor costs decreased 19 percentage points to 290 in 2021 due primarily to additional bonus pay incurred during 2020 for frontline team members as well as lower team member headcount in 2021 these decreases in labor costs were partially offset by continued investments in frontline team member wage rates in our us companyowned stores in 2021 

• food costs increased 11 percentage points to 281 in 2021 due to higher food basket prices 

• occupancy costs which include rent telephone utilities and depreciation increased 06 percentage points to 80 in 2021 due primarily to lower sales leverage 

  

supply chain operating margin 

  

   

supply chain operating margin decreased 74 million or 27 in 2021 due primarily to an estimated 64 million impact of the 53 rd week in 2020 as well as higher labor and delivery costs these decreases were partially offset by higher volumes as a percentage of supply chain revenues the supply chain operating margin decreased 09 percentage points in 2021 due primarily to higher labor and delivery costs 

  

  

  

general and administrative expenses 

  

general and administrative expenses increased 217 million or 53 in 2021 driven primarily by higher labor costs including noncash equitybased compensation expense higher travel and event costs also contributed to the increase in general and administrative expenses these increases were partially offset by lower professional fees and an estimated 56 million impact of the 53 rd week in 2020 

  

us franchise advertising expenses 

  

us franchise advertising expenses increased 173 million or 37 in 2021 due to higher us franchise advertising revenues as discussed above this increase was partially offset by an estimated 104 million impact of the 53 rd week in 2020 us franchise advertising costs are accrued and expensed when the related us franchise advertising revenues are recognized as our consolidated notforprofit advertising fund is obligated to expend such revenues on advertising and other activities to promote the domino’s brand and these revenues cannot be used for general corporate purposes 

  

other income 

  

other income was 368 million in 2021 representing the unrealized gains recorded on the company’s investment in dpc dash resulting from the observable changes in price from the valuation of the company’s additional 400 million investment made in the first quarter of 2021 and the additional 91 million investment made in the fourth quarter of 2021 

  

interest expense net 

  

interest expense net increased 209 million or 123 in 2021 driven primarily by higher average borrowings resulting from the 2021 recapitalization in connection with the 2021 recapitalization we recorded 23 million of incremental interest expense in the second quarter of 2021 primarily representing the expense for 20 million of the remaining unamortized debt issuance costs associated with the 2017 fiveyear fixed rate notes and 2017 floating rate notes each defined in the 2017 recapitalization section below and 03 million of additional interest expense incurred on the 2017 fiveyear fixed rate notes and 2017 floating rate notes subsequent to the closing of the 2021 recapitalization but prior to the repayment of the 2017 fiveyear fixed rate notes and 2017 floating rate notes resulting in the payment of interest on both the 2017 fiveyear fixed rate notes and 2017 floating rate notes and the 2021 notes as defined in the “2021 recapitalization” section below for a short period of time this increase was partially offset by an estimated 26 million impact of the 53 rd week in 2020 

  

our weighted average borrowing rate decreased to 38 in 2021 from 39 in 2020 resulting from the lower interest rates on the debt outstanding in 2021 as compared to the same periods in 2020 

  

provision for income taxes 

  

provision for income taxes increased 514 million or 805 in 2021 and the effective tax rate increased to 184 in 2021 as compared to 115 in 2020 due primarily to lower excess tax benefits on equitybased compensation which are recorded as a reduction to the income tax provision excess tax benefits from equitybased compensation were 189 million in 2021 and were 604 million in 2020 the decrease in excess tax benefits resulted from a significant decrease in stock options exercised in 2021 as compared to 2020 higher pretax income also resulted in an increase in the provision for income taxes these increases were partially offset by an estimated 40 million related to the 53 rd week of 2020 

  

  

  

segment income 

  

we evaluate the performance of our reportable segments and allocate resources to them based on earnings before interest taxes depreciation amortization and other referred to as segment income segment income for each of our reportable segments is summarized in the table below other segment income primarily includes corporate administrative costs that are not allocable to a reportable segment including labor computer expenses professional fees travel and entertainment rent insurance and other corporate administrative costs 

  

   

us stores 

  

us stores segment income increased 198 million or 45 in 2021  primarily as a result of the increase in revenues from us franchise royalties and fees of 367 million discussed above us franchise revenues do not have a cost of sales component so changes in these revenues have a disproportionate effect on us stores segment income us franchise advertising costs are accrued and expensed when the related us franchise advertising revenues are recognized and had no impact on us stores segment income the increase in us stores segment income was partially offset by increased investments in technological initiatives as well as the 11 million decrease in us companyowned store operating margin discussed above 

  

supply chain 

  

supply chain segment income decreased 85 million or 36 in 2021 due primarily to the 74 million decrease in supply chain operating margin described above 

  

international franchise 

  

international franchise segment income increased 443 million or 224 in 2021 due primarily to the 483 million increase in international franchise revenues discussed above international franchise revenues do not have a cost of sales component so changes in these revenues have a disproportionate effect on international franchise segment income the increase in international franchise segment income driven by higher revenues was partially offset by increased investments in technological initiatives 

  

other 

  

other segment income increased 103 million or 194 in 2021 due primarily to higher corporate administrative costs allocated to our segments as compared to 2020 the increase in allocated costs in 2021 was due primarily to higher investments in technological initiatives to support technology for our us and international franchise stores lower professional fees also contributed to the increase in other segment income these increases were partially offset by higher labor and travel costs 

  

new accounting pronouncements 

  

the impact of new accounting pronouncements adopted and the estimated impact of new accounting pronouncements that we will adopt in future years is included in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements 

  

  

  

covid19 impact 

  

as of january 2 2022 nearly all of our us stores were open with stores deploying contactless delivery and carryout solutions based on information reported to us by our master franchisees we estimate that as of january 2 2022 there were fewer than 50 international stores temporarily closed 

  

during the covid19 pandemic we made certain investments related to safety and cleaning equipment enhanced sick pay and compensation for frontline team members and support for our franchisees and their communities while we have seen an increase in sales in certain markets during the covid19 pandemic including increased sales related to heightened reliance on delivery and carryout businesses future sales are not possible to estimate and it is unclear whether and to what extent sales will return to more normalized levels if and when consumer behavior and general economic and business activity return to prepandemic levels while it is not possible at this time to estimate the full continued impact that covid19 could have on our business the continued spread of covid19 and the measures taken by the governments of countries affected could disrupt our continuing operations and supply chain and as a result could adversely impact our business financial condition or results of operations 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

 

historically our receivable collection periods and inventory turn rates are faster than the normal payment terms on our current liabilities resulting in efficient deployment of working capital we generally collect our receivables within three weeks from the date of the related sale and we generally experience multiple inventory turns per month in addition our sales are not typically seasonal which further limits variations in our working capital requirements these factors allow us to manage our working capital and our ongoing cash flows from operations to invest in our business and other strategic opportunities pay dividends and repurchase and retire shares of our common stock as of january 2 2022 we had working capital of 821 million excluding restricted cash and cash equivalents of 1806 million advertising fund assets restricted of 1809 million and advertising fund liabilities of 1737 million working capital includes total unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of 1482 million 

  

our primary source of liquidity is cash flows from operations and availability of borrowings under our variable funding notes during 2021 we experienced increases in both us and international same store sales versus the comparable periods in the prior year additionally our us and international businesses grew store counts in 2021 these factors contributed to our continued ability to generate positive operating cash flows the company has a variable funding note facility which allows for advances of up to 2000 million of 2021 variable funding notes defined in the “ 2021 recapitalization ” section below the letters of credit are primarily related to our casualty insurance programs and certain supply chain center leases as of january 2 2022 we had no outstanding borrowings and 1558 million of available borrowing capacity under our 2021 variable funding notes net of letters of credit issued of 442 million 

  

we expect to continue to use our unrestricted cash and cash equivalents cash flows from operations excess cash from our recapitalization transactions and available borrowings under our 2021 variable funding notes to among other things fund working capital requirements invest in our core business and other strategic opportunities pay dividends and repurchase and retire shares of our common stock 

  

our ability to continue to fund these items and continue to service our debt could be adversely affected by the occurrence of any of the events described in item 1a risk factors there can be no assurance that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operations or that future borrowings will be available under the 2021 variable funding notes or otherwise to enable us to service our indebtedness or to make anticipated capital expenditures our future operating performance and our ability to service extend or refinance the 2021 2019 2018 2017 and 2015 notes and to service extend or refinance the 2021 variable funding notes will be subject to future economic conditions and to financial business and other factors many of which are beyond our control 

 

  

  

restricted cash 

  

as of january 2 2022 we had 1332 million of restricted cash and cash equivalents held for future principal and interest payments and other working capital requirements of our assetbacked securitization structure 472 million of restricted cash equivalents held in a threemonth interest reserve as required by the related debt agreements and 02 million of other restricted cash for a total of 1806 million of restricted cash and cash equivalents as of january 2 2022 we also held 1617 million of advertising fund restricted cash and cash equivalents which can only be used for activities that promote the domino’s brand

 item 7a qua ntitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

 

market risk 

 

we do not engage in speculative transactions nor do we hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes in connection with the recapitalizations of our business we have issued fixed rate notes and entered into variable funding notes and at january 2 2022 we are exposed to interest rate risk on borrowings under our variable funding notes as of january 2 2022 we did not have any outstanding borrowings under our 2021 variable funding notes 

  

our 2021 variable funding notes bear interest at fluctuating interest rates based on libor there is currently uncertainty around whether libor will continue to exist after 2023 our 2021 variable funding notes loan documents contemplate a transition from libor to secured overnight financing rate “sofr” in the event that libor ceases to exist because the composition and characteristics of sofr are not the same as those of libor in such event there can be no assurance that sofr will perform the same way libor would have at any given time or for any applicable period as a result our interest expense could increase in which event we may have difficulties making interest payments and funding our other fixed costs and our available cash flow for general corporate requirements may be adversely affected 

  

our fixed rate debt exposes the company to changes in market interest rates reflected in the fair value of the debt and to the risk that the company may need to refinance maturing debt with new debt at a higher rate 

  

we are exposed to market risks from changes in commodity prices during the normal course of business we purchase cheese and certain other food products that are affected by changes in commodity prices and as a result we are subject to volatility in our food costs we may periodically enter into financial instruments to manage this risk although we have not done so historically we do not engage in speculative transactions or hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes in instances when we use fixed pricing agreements with our suppliers these agreements cover our physical commodity needs are not netsettled and are accounted for as normal purchases 

  

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

 

we have exposure to various foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations for revenues generated by our operations outside the us which can adversely impact our net income and cash flows approximately 68 of our total revenues in 2021 61 of our total revenues in 2020 and 67 of our total revenues in 2019 were derived from our international franchise segment a majority of which were denominated in foreign currencies we also operate dough manufacturing and distribution facilities in canada which generate revenues denominated in canadian dollars we do not enter into financial instruments to manage this foreign currency exchange risk a hypothetical 10 adverse change in the foreign currency rates for our international markets would have resulted in a negative impact on royalty revenues of approximately 265 million in 2021

 item 1 business 

overview 

domino’s is the largest pizza company in the world based on global retail sales with more than 17600 locations in over 90 markets around the world as of january 3 2021 founded in 1960 our roots are in convenient pizza delivery while a significant amount of our sales also come from carryout customers we are a highlyrecognized global brand and we focus on serving neighborhoods locally through our large global network of franchise owners and us companyowned stores we are primarily a franchisor with approximately 98 of domino’s stores currently owned and operated by our independent franchisees franchising enables an individual to be his or her own employer and maintain control over all employmentrelated matters and pricing decisions while also benefiting from the strength of the domino’s global brand and operating system with limited capital investment by us 

the domino’s business model is straightforward domino’s stores handcraft and serve quality food at a competitive price with easy ordering access and efficient service enhanced by our technological innovations our handtossed dough is made fresh and distributed to stores around the world by us and our franchisees 

domino’s generates revenues and earnings by charging royalties and fees to our franchisees royalties are ongoing percentofsales

fees for use of the domino’s ®

brand marks we also generate revenues and earnings by selling food equipment and supplies to franchisees through our supply chain operations primarily in the us and canada and by operating a number of companyowned stores in the us franchisees profit by selling pizza and other complementary items to their local customers in our international markets we generally grant geographical rights to the domino’s pizza ®

brand to master franchisees these master franchisees are charged with developing their geographical area and they may profit by subfranchising

and selling food and equipment to those subfranchisees

as well as by running pizza stores we believe that everyone in the system can benefit including the end consumer who can purchase domino’s menu items for themselves and their family conveniently and economically 

the domino’s business model can yield strong returns for our franchise owners and our companyowned stores it can also yield significant cash flows to us through a consistent franchise royalty payment and supply chain revenue stream with moderate capital expenditures we have historically returned cash to shareholders through dividend payments and share repurchases these factors emphasize our focus on our stakeholders including our customers team members franchisees communities and shareholders 

our history 

we pioneered the pizza delivery business and have been delivering quality affordable food to our customers since 1960 we became “domino’s pizza” in 1965 and opened our first franchised store in 1967 over the last 60 years we have built domino’s into one of the most widelyrecognized consumer brands in the world we believe our commitment to value convenience quality and new products continues to keep consumers engaged with the brand 

during 2020 in the midst of the uncertain environment created by the novel coronavirus “covid19”

pandemic we continued to increase global retail sales and our supply chain operations experienced higher volumes as a result of the increase in us retail sales we also launched three new products in the us including new and improved chicken wings and the new chicken taco and cheeseburger specialty pizzas each of which has been positively received by consumers additionally emphasis on technological innovation helped us achieve more than half of all global retail sales in 2020 from digital channels in the us we have developed several innovative ordering platforms including those for google home facebook messenger apple watch amazon echo twitter and more in 2019 we announced a partnership with nuro to further our exploration and testing of autonomous pizza delivery in 2020 we added gps to our domino’s tracker ®

 which allows customers to monitor the progress of their food from the preparation stages to the time it is in the oven to the time it arrives at their doors most recently we launched a new way to order contactless carryout nationwide – via domino’s carside delivery ™

 which customers can choose when placing a prepaid online order this new service method emphasizes our commitment to serving hot and delicious pizza in a convenient contactless manner 

since 1998 the company has been structured with a leveraged balance sheet and has completed a number of recapitalization transactions the company’s most recent recapitalization transaction in 2019 the “2019 recapitalization” primarily consisted of the issuance of 6750 million of fixed rate notes as of january 3 2021 the company had 412 billion in total debt which included debt from its 2019 recapitalization and its previous recapitalization transactions in 2018 2017 and 2015 the “2018 recapitalization” “2017 recapitalization” and the “2015 recapitalization” respectively and together with the 2019 recapitalization the “2019 2018 2017 and 2015 recapitalizations” 

 

our industry 

the us qsr pizza category is large and fragmented from 2015 through 2020 the us qsr pizza category has grown from 360 billion to 382 billion it is the secondlargest category within the 2720 billion us qsr sector the us qsr pizza category is primarily comprised of delivery dinein

and carryout with carryout and delivery comprising the two largest segments 

in the us we compete primarily in the delivery and carryout segments of the pizza industry and we are the dollar market share leader for delivery and a growing leader in carryout delivery segment dollars of 140 billion in 2020 up from 104 billion in 2015 account for approximately 37 of total us qsr pizza the four industry leaders including domino’s account for over 63 of us pizza delivery based on reported consumer spending with the remaining dollars going to regional chains and independent establishments from 2015 to 2020 the carryout segment grew from 175 billion to 203 billion the four industry leaders including domino’s account for approximately 48 of the carryout segment source the npd groupcrest ®

 year ending november 2020 

in contrast to the us international pizza delivery is relatively underdeveloped with only domino’s and two other competitors having a significant global presence we believe that demand for pizza delivery and pizza carryout is large and growing throughout the world driven by international consumers’ increasing emphasis on convenience and our proven success of more than 35 years of conducting business abroad 

our competition 

the global pizza delivery and carryout segments as well as the broader qsr sector are highly competitive in the us we compete against regional and local companies as well as national chains pizza hut ®

 papa john’s ®

and little caesars pizza ®

 internationally we compete primarily with pizza hut ®

 papa john’s ®

and countryspecific national and local pizzerias we generally compete on the basis of product quality location image service technology convenience and price our business and those of our competitors can be affected by changes in consumer tastes economic conditions demographic trends marketing advertising pricing and consumers’ disposable income we also compete with other food food delivery and order and delivery aggregation companies which have continued to grow in size and scale in recent years we compete not only for customers but also for management and hourly employees including store team members drivers and qualified franchisees as well as suitable real estate sites 

our customers 

the company’s business is not dependent upon a single retail customer or small group of customers including franchisees no customer accounted for more than 10 of total consolidated revenues in 2020 2019 or 2018 as of january 3 2021 our largest franchisee based on store count domino’s pizza enterprises dmp asx operated 2797 stores in nine international markets and accounted for 16 of our total store count revenues from this master franchisee accounted for 15 of our consolidated revenues in 2020 our international franchise segment only requires a modest amount of general and administrative expenses to support its markets and does not have a cost of sales component therefore the vast majority of these royalty revenues result in profits to us 

our menu 

we offer a menu designed to present an attractive quality offering to customers while keeping it simple enough to minimize order errors and expedite ordertaking and food preparation our basic menu features pizza products with varying sizes and crust types our typical store also offers ovenbaked sandwiches pasta boneless chicken and chicken wings bread side items desserts and soft drink products international markets vary toppings by country and culture such as the indi tandoori paneer pizza in india featuring spicy paneer peppers and mint mayo or the octopus bomb shrimp in korea featuring shrimp octopus vegetables feta cream and horseradish sauce 

store image and operations 

we have been focused on pizza delivery for 60 years and we also emphasize carryout as a significant component of our business the majority of our us and international stores are constructed in the carryoutfriendly pizza theater design many of these stores offer casual seating and enable customers to watch the preparation of their orders but do not offer a fullservice dinein

experience as a result our stores generally do not require expensive restaurant facilities and staffing 

 

our business segments 

we operate and report three business segments us stores international franchise and supply chain 

us stores 

during 2020 our us stores segment accounted for 145 billion or 35 of our consolidated revenues our us stores segment consists primarily of our franchise operations which consisted of 5992 franchised stores located in the united states as of january 3 2021 we also operated a network of 363 us companyowned stores as of january 3 2021 

directly operating domino’s stores contributes significantly to our ability to act as a credible franchisor we also use our companyowned stores as test sites for technological innovation and promotions as well as operational improvements we also use them for training new store managers and operations team members as well as developing prospective franchisees while we are primarily a franchised business we continuously evaluate our mix of us companyowned and franchise stores as of january 3 2021 franchised stores represented approximately 94 of our total store count within our us stores segment 

us franchise profile 

as of january 3 2021 our network of 5992 us franchise stores was owned and operated by 762 independent us franchisees our franchise formula enables franchisees to benefit from our brand recognition with a relatively low initial capital investment as of january 3 2021 the average us franchisee owned and operated approximately seven stores and had been in our franchise system for over 18 years additionally 19 of our us franchisees operated more than 50 stores including our largest us franchisee who operated 178 stores and 228 of our us franchisees each operated one store each as of that date 

we apply rigorous standards to prospective us franchisees we generally require them to manage a store for at least one year and graduate from our franchise management school program before being granted the right to franchise this enables us to observe the operational and financial performance of a potential franchisee prior to entering into a longterm agreement substantially all of our independent us franchise owners started their careers with us as delivery drivers or in other instore

positions which we believe offers advantages in terms of familiarity with our business and store operations in addition we generally restrict the ability of us franchisees to be involved in other businesses which we believe helps focus our franchisees’ attention on operating their stores we believe these characteristics and standards are largely unique within the franchise industry and have resulted in qualified and focused franchisees operating domino’s stores we maintain a productive relationship with our independent franchise owners through regional franchise teams distributing materials that help franchise stores comply with our standards and using franchise advisory groups that facilitate communications between us and our franchisees we consider our relationship with our us franchisees to be good 

us franchise agreements 

we enter into franchise agreements with us franchisees under which the franchisee is generally granted the right to operate a store in a particular location for a term of ten years with an ability to renew for an additional term of ten years we had a franchise agreement renewal rate of approximately 99 in 2020 under the current standard franchise agreement we assign an exclusive area of primary responsibility to each franchised store each franchisee is generally required to pay a 55 royalty fee on sales as well as certain technology fees in certain instances we will collect lower rates based on certain incentives 

our stores in the united states currently contribute 6 of their sales to fund national marketing and advertising campaigns subject in certain instances to lower rates based on certain incentives and waivers these funds are administered by domino’s national advertising fund inc “dnaf” our consolidated notforprofit

advertising subsidiary the funds are primarily used to purchase media for advertising and also to support market research field communications public relations commercial production talent payments and other activities to promote the domino’s brand in addition to the national and marketlevel advertising contributions us stores generally spend additional funds on local store marketing activities 

we have the contractual right subject to state law to terminate a franchise agreement for a variety of reasons including but not limited to a franchisee’s failure to adhere to the company’s franchise agreement failure to make required payments or failure to adhere to specified company policies and standards 

 

international franchise 

during 2020 our international franchise segment accounted for 2498 million or 6 of our consolidated revenues this segment is comprised of a network of franchised stores in more than 90 international markets at january 3 2021 we had 11289 international franchise stores the principal sources of revenues from those operations are royalty payments generated by retail sales from franchised stores as well as certain technology fees 

our international franchisees employ our basic standard operating model and adapt it to satisfy the local eating habits and consumer preferences of various regions outside the us currently the vast majority of our international stores operate under master franchise agreements 

we believe domino’s appeals to potential international franchisees because of our recognized brand name and technological leadership the moderate capital expenditures required to open and operate the stores and the system’s desirable storelevel profitability stores in seven of our ten largest international markets in terms of store count are operated by master franchise companies that are publicly traded on stock exchanges as noted in the below table the following table shows our store count as of january 3 2021 in our ten largest international markets which accounted for approximately 62 of our international stores as of that date 

 

 

international franchisee profile 

the vast majority of our markets outside of the us are operated by master franchisees with franchise and distribution rights for entire regions or countries in a few select markets we franchise directly to individual store operators prospective master franchisees are required to possess local market knowledge to establish and develop domino’s stores with the ability to identify and access targeted real estate sites as well as expertise in local laws customs culture and consumer behavior we also seek candidates that have access to sufficient capital to meet growth and development plans we consider our relationship with our international franchisees to be good 

international master franchise and other agreements 

our international master franchise agreements generally grant the franchisee exclusive rights to develop and subfranchise

stores and the right to operate supply chain centers in particular geographic areas agreements are generally for a term of ten years with options to renew for additional terms the agreements typically contain growth clauses requiring franchisees to open a minimum number of stores within a specified period the master franchisee is generally required to pay an initial onetime

franchise fee as well as an additional franchise fee upon the opening of each new store the master franchisee is also required to pay a continuing royalty fee as a percentage of sales which varies among international markets and may also differ based on certain incentives and concessions and averaged approximately 29 in 2020 we also have agreements with certain of our international master franchisees with respect to certain technology fees 

supply chain 

during 2020 our supply chain segment accounted for 242 billion or 59 of our consolidated revenues 

we operate 21 regional dough manufacturing and supply chain centers in the us two thin crust manufacturing facilities and one vegetable processing center in the us and five dough manufacturing and supply chain centers in canada our supply chain segment leases a fleet of approximately 900 tractors and trailers we plan to continue investing in additional supply chain capacity in the future our centers produce fresh dough and purchase receive store and deliver quality food and other complementary items to substantially all of our us stores and most of our canadian franchised stores we regularly supply over 6800 stores with various food and supplies 

 

we believe our franchisees voluntarily choose to obtain food supplies and equipment from us because we offer the most efficient convenient and costeffective alternative while also offering both quality and consistency our supply chain segment offers profitsharing arrangements to us and canadian franchisees who purchase all of their food for their stores from our centers these profitsharing arrangements generally offer participating franchisees and companyowned stores with 50 or a higher percentage in the case of companyowned stores and certain franchisees who operate a larger number of stores of the pretax

profit from our supply chain center operations we believe these arrangements strengthen our ties to and provide aligned benefits with franchisees 

thirdparty suppliers 

a significant amount of our annual food spend is with suppliers with whom we maintain longstanding partnerships our supply partners are required to meet strict quality standards to ensure food safety we review and evaluate these partners’ quality assurance programs through among other actions onsite

visits thirdparty audits and product evaluations designed to ensure compliance with our standards we believe the length and quality of our relationships with thirdparty suppliers provides us with priority service and quality products at competitive prices 

cheese is our largest food cost the price we charge to our us franchisees for cheese is formulabased with the chicago mercantile exchange cheddar block price as the primary component plus a supply chain markup as cheese prices fluctuate our revenues and margin percentages in our supply chain segment also fluctuate however actual supply chain dollar margins remain unchanged we currently purchase our us pizza cheese from a single supplier under our september 2017 agreement our us supplier agreed to provide the company with an uninterrupted supply of cheese and the company agreed to a sevenyear pricing schedule to purchase all of its us pizza cheese from this supplier while we expect to meet the terms of this agreement if we do not we will be required to repay certain negotiated cost savings as provided in the agreement the majority of our meat toppings in the us come from a single supplier under a contract that expires in june 2022 we have the right to terminate these arrangements for quality failures and for certain uncured breaches 

we have entered into a multiyear agreement with cocacola ®

for the us this contract renegotiated in june 2019 provides for cocacola to continue to be our exclusive beverage supplier and expires on december 31 2023 or at such time as a minimum number of cases of cocacola products are purchased by domino’s whichever occurs later 

we believe alternative thirdparty suppliers are available for all of these referenced products while we may incur additional costs if we are required to replace any of our supply partners we do not believe such additional costs would have a material adverse effect on our business we continually evaluate each supply category to determine the optimal sourcing strategy 

we have not experienced any significant shortages of supplies or delays in receiving our inventories or products prices charged to us by our supply partners are subject to fluctuation and we have historically been able to pass increased costs and savings on to stores we periodically enter into supplier contracts to manage the risk from changes in commodity prices we do not engage in speculative transactions nor do we hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes 

our strengths 

strong brand equity 

we are the largest pizza company in the world based on global retail sales we believe our domino’s brand is one of the most widelyrecognized consumer brands in the world we are the recognized world leader in pizza delivery and have a significant business in carryout we believe consumers associate our brand with the timely delivery of quality affordable food and technological innovation 

over the past five years our us franchise and companyowned stores have invested an estimated 22 billion in national cooperative

and local advertising our international franchisees also invest significant amounts in advertising efforts in their markets we continue to reinforce our brand with extensive advertising through various media channels we have also enhanced the strength of our brand through marketing affiliations with brands such as cocacola 

we are the number one pizza delivery company in the us with a 36 share of pizza delivery based on consumer spending data for the year ending november 2020 for the same period we are also a growing leader in carryout with a 15 share of carryout pizza consumer spending source the npd groupcrest ®

 year ending november 2020 with 6355 stores located in the us our store delivery areas cover a majority of us households our share position and scale allow us to leverage our purchasing power supply chain strength and marketing investments we believe our scale and market coverage allow us to effectively serve our customers’ demands for convenience and timely delivery outside the us we have significant market share positions in many of the markets in which we compete 

 

strong and proven business model 

our business model generates us and international franchise royalties and fees supply chain revenue and retail sales at companyowned stores we have developed this model over our many years of operation and it is anchored by strong storelevel economics which provide an entrepreneurial incentive for our franchisees and historically has generated demand for new stores over the past ten years average us store profitability in the domino’s system has increased meaningfully resulting in higher profitability for our franchise owners our franchise system in turn has produced strong and consistent earnings for us through royalty payments and through supply chain revenues 

we developed a costefficient store model characterized by a delivery and carryoutoriented store design with moderate capital requirements and a menu of quality affordable items at the store level we believe the simplicity and efficiency of our operations give us significant advantages over our competitors who in many cases also focus on dinein

or have broader menu offerings at the supply chain level we believe we provide quality good value and consistency for our franchise customers while also driving profits for us which we share with our franchisees under the profitsharing arrangements described above 

our menu simplifies and streamlines production and delivery processes and maximizes economies of scale on purchases of our principal food items in addition our stores including those in our pizza theater image are generally smaller and less expensive to build furnish and maintain as compared to many other restaurant concepts and they create a positive experience for our carryout customers the combination of this efficient store model and strong sales volume has resulted in strong storelevel economics and we believe makes domino’s an attractive business opportunity for existing and prospective franchisees around the world we and our franchisees are continuing to focus on growing our global store 2count in recent years we have focused specifically on increasing our presence in our existing markets to provide better service to our customers including shrinking our delivery areas to provide better delivery service and adding locations that are closer to our carryout customers we call this approach our fortressing strategy 

we believe our store financial returns have led to a strong welldiversified franchise system this established franchise system has produced strong cash flows and earnings for us enabling us to invest in the domino’s brand stores technology and supply chain centers pay dividends repurchase and retire shares of our common stock and service our debt obligations 

technological innovation 

technological innovation is vital to our brand and our longterm success and digital ordering is critical to competing in the global pizza and broader qsr industries emphasis on technological innovation helped us achieve more than half of all global retail sales in 2020 from digital channels in the us we have developed several innovative ordering platforms including those for google home facebook messenger apple watch amazon echo twitter and more in 2019 we announced a partnership with nuro to further our exploration and testing of autonomous pizza delivery in 2020 we added gps to our domino’s tracker which allows customers to monitor the progress of their food from the preparation stages to the time it is in the oven to the time it arrives at their doors in mid2020

we launched a new way to order contactless carryout nationwide – via domino’s carside delivery ™

 which customers can choose when placing a prepaid online order 

our piece of the pie rewards ®

loyalty program is meant to reward customers with a program that is simple to understand and easy to use upon signing up for the program customers become rewards members and can earn points for online orders when rewards members reach a certain amount of points they can redeem their points for free pizza rewards members may also receive exclusive membersonly discounts and bonus offers we may also occasionally provide additional opportunities for participating customers to benefit under the piece of the pie rewards program 

this improved functionality has been developed to work seamlessly with our domino’s pulse ™

pointofsale

system our domino’s pulse system is designed to drive operating efficiencies for our franchisees and our corporate management and assist franchisees in independently managing their business as of january 3 2021 domino’s pulse is being used in every companyowned store in the us in more than 99 of our us franchised stores and in approximately 77 of our international stores we believe utilizing domino’s pulse with our integrated technology solutions throughout our system provides us with competitive advantages over other concepts 

we intend to continue to enhance and grow our online ordering digital marketing and technological capabilities 

 

product innovation 

we believe our core handtossed pizza recipe has contributed to longterm growth in customer reorder rates consumer traffic and increased sales this recipe is now in use in other markets around the world our 60 years of innovation have resulted in numerous new product developments during 2020 we launched three new products in the us including new and improved chicken wings and the new chicken taco and cheeseburger specialty pizzas each of which has been positively received by consumers product innovation is also present in our global markets where our master franchisees have the ability to recommend products to suit their local market tastes products include the mayo jaga in japan bacon potatoes and sweet mayonnaise and the saumoneta in france light cream potatoes onions smoked salmon and dill 

internal dough manufacturing and supply chain system 

in addition to generating significant revenues and earnings in the us and canada we believe our vertically integrated dough manufacturing and supply chain system enhances the quality and consistency of our products enhances our relationships with franchisees and leverages economies of scale to offer lower costs to our stores it also allows store managers to focus on store operations and customer service by relieving them of the responsibility of mixing dough in the stores and sourcing other ingredients many of our international master franchisees also profit from running supply chain businesses in their respective markets 

human capital 

as of january 3 2021 we had approximately 14400 employees including 10400 employees supporting our us companyowned stores and us franchise operations our us stores segment approximately 2900 employees supporting our us and canadian supply chain operations our supply chain segment approximately 100 employees supporting our international franchise operations our international franchise segment and approximately 1000 corporate employees approximately 7500 of our employees are parttime and approximately 6900 are fulltime equivalent none of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement we consider our relationship with our employees to be good 

environmental responsibility 

we believe in being strong stewards of the environment through initiatives to reduce the impact of energy wastewater land use and waste both in packaging and food since 2015 we have sourced 100 sustainable mass balance palm oil which is used in some of our products we have also recently increased the recycled content of our pizza boxes and launched a nationwide campaign to educate municipalities on the recyclability of pizza boxes we also introduced ebikes for delivery in certain markets around the world helping us to reduce our carbon footprint domino’s is also a member of the dairy sustainability alliance the recycling partnership and the food waste reduction alliance you can find more information about these initiatives at stewardshipdominoscom

risk factors 

tableend 

for a business as large and globally diverse as the company a wide range of factors could materially affect future developments and performance in addition to the factors affecting specific business operations identified in connection with the description of these operations and the financial results of these operations elsewhere in this report and our other filings with the sec we believe the most significant risk factors affecting our business include the following 

business operational and industry risks 

the quick service restaurant pizza category and the food service and food delivery markets in general are highly competitive and such competition could adversely affect our operating results 

in the us we compete primarily against regional and local companies as well as national chains pizza hut ®

 papa john’s ®

and little caesars pizza ®

 internationally we compete primarily with pizza hut ®

 papa john’s ®

and countryspecific national and local companies we could experience increased competition from existing or new companies in the delivery and carryout pizza category that could create increasing pressures to grow our business in order to maintain our market share additionally we face growing competition from the supermarket industry and meal kit and food delivery providers with the improvement of prepared food and meal kit offerings expansion in meal delivery platforms and services and the trend towards convergence in grocery deli retail and restaurant services 

we also compete on a broader scale with quick service and other international national regional and local restaurants competition from order and delivery aggregators and other food delivery services has also increased in recent years and order and delivery aggregators have continued to grow in size and scale the overall food service market food delivery market and the quick service restaurant market are intensely competitive with respect to food quality price service image convenience and concept and are often affected by changes in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we compete within the food service market and the quick service restaurant market not only for customers but also for management and hourly employees including store team members drivers and qualified franchisees as well as suitable real estate sites our supply chain segment is also subject to competition from outside suppliers while substantially all us franchisees purchased food equipment and supplies from us in 2020 us franchisees are not required to purchase food equipment or supplies from us and they may choose to purchase from outside suppliers if other suppliers who meet our qualification standards were to offer lower prices or better service to our franchisees for their ingredients and supplies and as a result our franchisees chose not to purchase from our us supply chain centers our financial condition business and results of operations would be adversely affected 

if we are unable to maintain our competitive position we could experience downward pressure on prices lower demand for our products reduced margins loss of management or hourly employees disruption in our supply chain centers the inability to take advantage of new business opportunities and the loss of market share all of which would have an adverse effect on our operating results and could cause our stock price to decline 

worldwide economic activity has been and is expected to continue to be adversely affected by the covid19

pandemic the scale and scope of which is ultimately unknown which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

the global covid19

pandemic continues to impact worldwide economic activity a public health pandemic such as covid19

poses the risk that we andor our employees franchisees supply chain centers suppliers customers and other partners may be or may continue to be prevented from conducting business activities for an indefinite period of time including due to shutdowns travel restrictions social distancing requirements stay at home orders and advisories and other restrictions that have been or may be suggested or mandated by governmental authorities or due to the impact of the disease itself on a business’ workforces in addition covid19

may impact the willingness of customers to purchase food prepared outside of the home the covid19

pandemic may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described throughout this report including but not limited to those relating to our growth strategy our supply chain and increased food and labor costs disruption in operations loss of key employees our indebtedness general economic conditions and our international operations 

 

in response to governmental requirements we and our franchisees have implemented a number of measures including among others temporarily closing certain of our stores modifying certain stores’ hours and closing locations to instore

dining and we continue to monitor additional developments we have also made additional operating changes in response to changes in consumer behavior and preferences resulting from covid19

including offering contactless delivery and carryout options to our customers while it is not possible at this time to estimate the full impact that covid19

could have on our business going forward the continued spread of the virus and the measures taken in response have disrupted our operations and could disrupt our supply chain including our access to face coverings for use in our operations which could adversely impact our business financial condition and results of operations the covid19

pandemic and mitigation measures have also had an adverse impact on global economic conditions which could have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition the company’s sales and operating results may be affected by uncertain or changing economic and market conditions arising in connection with and in response to the covid19

pandemic including inflation deflation prolonged weak consumer demand political instability or other changes while the company has seen an increase in sales in certain markets including within the us during the covid19

pandemic including increased sales related to heightened reliance on delivery and carryout

businesses future sales are not possible to estimate and it is unclear whether and to what extent sales will return to more normalized levels if and when consumer behavior and general economic and business activity return to prepandemic

levels the significance of the operational and financial impact to the company will depend on how long and widespread the disruptions caused by covid19

and the corresponding response to contain the virus and treat those affected by it prove to be 

if we fail to successfully implement our growth strategy which includes opening new us and international stores our ability to increase our revenues and operating profits could be adversely affected 

a significant component of our growth strategy includes the opening of new us both companyowned as well as franchised stores and international franchised stores we and our franchisees face many challenges in opening new stores including among others 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the opening of additional franchise stores also depends in part upon the availability of prospective franchisees who meet our criteria our failure to add a significant number of new stores would adversely affect our ability to increase revenues and operating income additionally our growth strategy and the success of new stores depend in large part on the availability of suitable store sites if we and our franchisees are not able to secure leases in desired locations on favorable terms or to renew such leases our business and results of operations may be adversely affected 

we and our franchisees are currently planning to expand our us and international operations in many of the markets where we currently operate and in select new markets this may require considerable management time as well as startup

expenses for market development before any significant revenues and earnings are generated operations in new foreign markets may achieve low margins or may be unprofitable and expansion in existing markets may be affected by local economic and market conditions in addition we expect to continue our strategy of building additional stores in markets and regions where we have existing stores a strategy we refer to as “fortressing” which may negatively impact sales at existing stores therefore as we continue to expand we or our franchisees may not experience the operating margins we expect our results of operations may be negatively impacted and our common stock price may decline additionally we have an equity investment in dash brands ltd “dash brands” as further discussed elsewhere in this report through its subsidiaries dash brands serves as the company’s master franchisee in china that owns and operates domino’s pizza stores in that market these types of investments are inherently risky if dash brands does not succeed or is unable to successfully execute its growth strategy we may be forced to record impairment charges and could lose some or all of our investment 

we may also pursue strategic acquisitions as part of our business if we are able to identify acquisition candidates such acquisitions may be financed to the extent permitted under our debt agreements with substantial debt or with potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities 

 

the food service market is affected by consumer preferences and perceptions changes in these preferences and perceptions may reduce the demand for our products which would reduce sales and harm our business 

food service businesses are affected by changes in consumer tastes international national regional and local economic conditions marketing advertising pricing including discounting and demographic trends for instance if prevailing health or dietary preferences cause consumers to avoid pizza and other products we offer in favor of foods that are perceived as healthier our business and operating results would be harmed moreover because we are primarily dependent on a single product if consumer demand for pizza should decrease our business would suffer more than if we had a more diversified menu as many other food service businesses do the preferences of customers also may change as a result of advances in technology or alternative delivery methods or channels if we are not able to respond to these changes or our competitors respond to these changes more effectively our business and operating results could be adversely affected 

reports of foodborne illness or food tampering could reduce sales and harm our business 

reports whether true or not of foodborne illnesses such as e coli avian flu bovine spongiform encephalopathy hepatitis a trichinosis or salmonella and injuries caused by food tampering have in the past severely injured the reputations of participants in the quick service restaurant market and could in the future as well the potential for acts of terrorism affecting our global food supply also exists and if such an event occurs could have a negative impact on us and could severely hurt sales and profits in addition our reputation is an important asset as a result anything that damages our reputation could immediately and severely affect our sales and profits media reports of illnesses and injuries whether accurate or not could force some stores to close or otherwise reduce sales at such stores moreover as described above social media has dramatically increased the rate at which negative publicity including as it relates to foodborne illness can be disseminated before there is any meaningful opportunity to respond to or address an issue even reports of foodborne illnesses or food tampering occurring solely at the restaurants of competitors could by resulting in negative publicity about the restaurant industry in general adversely affect us on a local regional national or international basis further the occurrence of a widespread illness health epidemic or pandemic such as covid19

or other general health concern could adversely affect us on a local regional or international basis a decrease in global retail sales as a result of these health concerns or negative publicity or as a result of the closure of any domino’s stores could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

we do not have longterm contracts with certain of our suppliers and as a result they could seek to significantly increase prices or fail to deliver 

we do not have longterm contracts or arrangements with certain of our suppliers although in the past we have not experienced significant problems with our suppliers our suppliers may implement significant price increases or may not meet our requirements including those that may result from increases in volume in a timely fashion or at all the occurrence of any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on the ability of our supply chain centers to deliver necessary products to our stores and on our results of operations 

shortages interruptions or disruptions in the supply or delivery of fresh food products could adversely affect our operating results 

we and our franchisees are dependent on frequent deliveries of food products that meet our specifications in addition we have single suppliers or a limited number of suppliers for certain of our ingredients including pizza cheese and meat toppings while we believe there are adequate reserve quantities and potential alternative suppliers shortages interruptions or disruptions in the supply of food products caused by increased demand capacity constraints problems in production or distribution product recalls financial or other difficulties of suppliers inclement weather or other conditions could adversely affect the availability quality and cost of ingredients we have in the past experienced disruptions within our supply chain resulting from among other things capacity volume staffing operational and covid19related

challenges and may experience such supply chain disruptions again in the future which could adversely affect our business and operational results additionally the effects of climate change could increase the frequency and duration of weather impacts on our operations and could adversely affect our operating results 

 

increases in food labor and other costs could adversely affect our profitability and operating results 

an increase in our operating costs could adversely affect our profitability and other operating results factors such as inflation increased food costs increased labor and employee health and benefit costs increased rent costs and increased energy costs may adversely affect our operating costs most of the factors affecting costs are beyond our control and in many cases we may not be able to pass along these increased costs to our customers or franchisees most ingredients used in our pizza particularly cheese are subject to significant price fluctuations as a result of seasonality weather demand and other factors for example we have experienced increased volatility in prices for some ingredients during the covid19

pandemic which may continue even if the pandemic recedes cheese is a significant cost to us representing approximately 25 of the market basket purchased by our companyowned stores 

additionally while we strive to engage in a competitive bidding process for our ingredients because certain of these ingredients including meat products may only be available from a limited number of vendors we may not always be able to do so effectively furthermore if we need to seek new suppliers we may be subject to pricing or other terms less favorable to us than those reflected in our current supply arrangements labor costs are largely a function of the minimum wage for a majority of our store personnel and certain supply chain center personnel and generally are also a function of the availability of labor several jurisdictions in which we operate have recently approved minimum wage increases federal state and local proposals that increase minimum wage requirements or mandate other employee matters could to the extent implemented materially increase our labor and other costs as more jurisdictions implement minimum wage increases we expect our labor costs will continue to increase the advent of legislation aimed at predictive scheduling could impact labor for our stores and our franchisees’ stores additionally while we do not currently have any unionized employees if a significant portion of our employees were to become unionized our labor costs could increase and our business could be negatively affected by other union requirements that increase our costs disrupt our business reduce our flexibility and impact our employee culture labor costs and food costs including cheese generally represent approximately 50 to 60 of the sales at a typical companyowned store 

any prolonged disruption in the operations of any of our dough manufacturing and supply chain centers could harm our business 

we operate 21 regional dough manufacturing and supply chain centers in the us two thin crust manufacturing facilities and one vegetable processing center in the us and five dough manufacturing and supply chain centers in canada we plan to continue investing in additional supply chain capacity in the future 

our us dough manufacturing and supply chain centers service all of our companyowned and us franchise stores as a result any prolonged disruption in the operations of any of these facilities whether due to technical operational or labor difficulties destruction or damage to the facility real estate issues limited capacity or other reasons could adversely affect our business and operating results 

our inability or failure to recognize respond to and effectively manage the accelerated impact of social media could adversely impact our business 

the use of social media platforms including blogs chat platforms social media websites and other forms of internetbased communications that allow individuals access to a broad audience of consumers and other persons including to our customers and the general public and other consumeroriented technologies has increased the speed and accessibility of information dissemination and given users the ability to more effectively organize collective actions such as boycotts and other branddamaging behaviors negative publicity related to our food products or stores or negative publicity related to actions by our executives team members or franchisees and their team members could harm our business brand reputation marketing partners financial condition and results of operations regardless of the accuracy of such negative publicity failure to use or respond to social media campaigns effectively could lead to a decline in brand value and revenue 

in addition a failure of us our employees our franchisees or third parties acting at our direction to abide by applicable laws and regulations in the use of social media could adversely impact our brand reputation marketing partners financial condition and results of operations or subject us or our franchisees to fines or other penalties other risks associated with the use of social media include improper disclosure of proprietary information exposure of personally identifiable information fraud hoaxes or malicious dissemination of false information 

 

our success depends in part upon effective advertising and lower advertising funds may reduce our ability to adequately market the domino’s pizza brand 

we have been routinely named a leading national advertiser by advertising age

and our success depends in part on continued effective advertising each domino’s store located in the us is obligated to contribute 6 of its sales subject in certain instances to lower rates based on certain incentives and waivers to dnaf which uses such fees for national advertising in addition to contributions for local marketlevel advertising we currently anticipate that this 6 contribution rate will remain in place for the foreseeable future while additional funds for advertising in the past have been provided by us our franchisees and other third parties none of these additional funds are legally required the lack of continued financial support for advertising activities could significantly curtail our marketing efforts which may in turn materially and adversely affect our business and our operating results 

loss of key employees or our inability to attract and retain new qualified employees could hurt our business and inhibit our ability to operate and grow successfully 

our success in the highly competitive pizza delivery and carryout business will continue to depend to a significant extent on our leadership team and other key management personnel although we have entered into employment agreements with richard e allison jr and russell j weiner each of these executives may terminate his agreement on ninety days’ notice our other executive officers may terminate their employment pursuant to their employment agreements at any time as a result we may not be able to retain our executive officers and key personnel or attract additional qualified management while we do not have longterm employment agreements with our executive officers for all of our executive officers we have noncompete

and nonsolicitation

agreements that extend for 24 months following the termination of such executive officer’s employment our success will also continue to depend on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel to operate our stores dough manufacturing and supply chain centers and international operations the loss of these employees or our inability to recruit and retain qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 

our international operations subject us to additional risk such risks and costs may differ in each country in which we and our franchisees do business and may cause our profitability to decline due to increased costs 

we conduct a significant and growing portion of our business outside the us our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected if global markets in which our franchise stores compete are affected by changes in political economic or other factors these factors over which neither we nor our franchisees have control may include 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

our earnings and business growth strategy depend on the success of our franchisees and we may be harmed by actions taken by our franchisees or employees of our franchisees that are outside of our control 

a significant portion of our earnings comes from royalties and fees generated by our franchise stores franchisees are independent operators and their employees are not our employees we provide tools that franchisees can consider using in training their employees but the quality of franchise store operations and our brand and branded products may be diminished by any number of factors beyond our control consequently franchisees may not operate stores in a manner consistent with our standards and requirements or they or their employees may take other actions that adversely affect the value of our brand in such event our business and reputation may suffer and as a result our revenues and stock price could decline 

 

while we try to ensure that franchisees maintain the quality of the domino’s brand and branded products and comply with their franchise agreements franchisees may take actions that adversely affect the value of our intellectual property or reputation or that are inconsistent with their contractual obligations although our franchise arrangements permit the applicable franchisor to terminate a franchise agreement under certain circumstances including the failure by franchisees to uphold quality standards there can be no assurance that such remedy will be available or sufficient to prevent harm to our brand and protect our intellectual property 

as of january 3 2021 we had 762 us franchisees operating 5992 us stores as of that same date 19 of these franchisees each owned and operated more than 50 us stores including our largest us franchisee who owned and operated 178 stores and the average us franchisee owned and operated approximately seven stores 

our international master franchisees are generally responsible for the development of significantly more stores than our us franchisees as a result our international operations are more closely tied to the success of a smaller number of franchisees than our us operations as of january 3 2021 our largest international master franchisee operated 2797 stores in nine markets which accounted for approximately 25 of our total international store count our us and international franchisees may not operate their franchises successfully if one or more of our key franchisees were to become insolvent or otherwise were unable or unwilling to pay us our royalties or other amounts owed our business and results of operations would be adversely affected 

we may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property which could harm the value of our brand and branded products and adversely affect our business 

we depend in large part on our brand and branded products and believe that they are very important to our business we rely on a combination of trademarks copyrights trade secrets and similar intellectual property rights to protect our brand and branded products the success of our business depends on our continued ability to use our existing trademarks in order to capitalize on our name recognition increase brand awareness and further develop our branded products in both us and international markets we have registered certain trademarks and have other trademark applications pending in the us and foreign jurisdictions not all of the trademarks that we currently use have been registered in all of the countries in which we do business and they may never be registered in all of these countries some countries’ laws do not protect unregistered trademarks at all or make them more difficult to enforce and third parties may have filed for “domino’s” or similar marks in countries where domino’s has not registered its brand accordingly we may not be able to adequately protect our trademarks everywhere in the world and our use of these trademarks may result in liability for trademark infringement trademark dilution or unfair competition 

all of the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property in the us and in foreign countries may not be adequate in addition the laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the us 

we may from time to time be required to institute or defend litigation to enforce our trademarks or other intellectual property rights or to protect our trade secrets such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could negatively affect our sales profitability and prospects regardless of whether we are able to successfully enforce our rights 

the occurrence of cyber incidents or a deficiency in cybersecurity could negatively impact our business by causing a disruption to our operations a compromise or corruption of confidential information or damage to our employee and business relationships any of which could subject us to loss and harm our brand 

a cyber incident is considered to be any adverse event that threatens the confidentiality integrity or availability of information resources more specifically a cyber incident is an intentional attack or an unintentional event that can include gaining unauthorized access to systems to disrupt operations corrupt data or steal confidential information about customers franchisees suppliers or employees a number of retailers and other companies have recently experienced serious cyber incidents and breaches of their information technology systems as our reliance on technology has increased so have the risks posed to our systems both internal and those we have outsourced we could also be subject to negative impacts to our business caused by cyber incidents relating to our thirdparty service providers 

the three primary risks that could directly result from the occurrence of a cyber incident include operational interruption damage to our relationships with customers franchisees and employees and private data exposure including payment card or other financial data in addition to maintaining insurance coverage to address cyber incidents we have also implemented processes procedures and controls to help mitigate these risks however our cyber insurance coverage may not fully cover all of the costs associated with a cyber incident and these measures as well as our increased awareness of the risk of a cyber incident do not guarantee that our reputation and financial results will not be materially and adversely affected by such an incident 

 

our and our franchisees’ operations depend upon our ability and the ability of franchisees and thirdparty service providers as well as franchisees’ thirdparty service providers to protect computer equipment and systems against damage from theft fire power loss telecommunications failure and other catastrophic or unanticipated events as well as internal and external security incidents viruses denialofservice

attacks phishing attacks ransomware attacks and other intentional or unintentional disruptions a significant portion of our retail sales depend on the continuing operation of our information technology and communications systems including but not limited to domino’s pulse ™

 our online and mobile ordering platforms and our credit card processing systems the failure of these systems to operate effectively stemming from maintenance problems upgrading or transitioning to new platforms a compromise in our security or other unanticipated problems could result in interruptions to or delays in our and our franchisees’ operations some of our systems are not fully redundant and our system’s disaster recovery planning cannot account for all eventualities the occurrence of a natural disaster intentional sabotage or other unanticipated problems could result in lengthy interruptions in service in addition the implementation of technology changes and upgrades to maintain and upgrade our systems errors or vulnerabilities in our systems or damage to or failure of our systems could result in interruptions in our services and noncompliance

with certain laws or regulations which could reduce our sales revenues and profits and damage our business and brand furthermore as a result of the covid19

pandemic certain of our employees have been required to work from home the significant increase in remote working particularly for an extended period of time could exacerbate certain risks to our business including an increased risk of cyber incidents and improper dissemination of personal or confidential information 

because we and our franchisees accept electronic forms of payment from customers our business requires the collection and retention of customer data including sensitive financial data and other personally identifiable information in various information systems that we and our franchisees maintain and in those maintained by third parties with whom we and our franchisees contract to provide payment processing a weakness in such third party’s systems or software products may provide a mechanism for a cyber threat in recent years a significant number of companies have experienced security data breaches in which customer information was stolen through vendor access channels while we select our thirdparty suppliers carefully cyberattacks and security data breaches at a payment processing contractor could compromise confidential information or adversely affect our ability to deliver products and services to our customers these problems could negatively affect our results of operations and remediation could result in significant unplanned capital investments 

we also maintain important internal company data such as personally identifiable information about our employees and franchisees and information relating to our operations in addition more than half of all global retail sales in 2020 were derived from digital channels primarily through our online ordering website and mobile applications where customers enter personally identifiable information that we retain our use and retention of personally identifiable information is regulated by foreign federal and state laws and regulations as well as by certain thirdparty agreements for example the european union adopted a new regulation that became effective in may 2018 the european union general data protection regulation and the state of california adopted the california consumer privacy act that became effective on january 1 2020 both of which require companies to meet new requirements regarding the handling of personal data as privacy and information security laws and regulations change we may incur additional costs to ensure that we remain in compliance with those laws and regulations if our security and information systems are compromised or if we our employees or franchisees fail to comply with these laws regulations or contract terms or to successfully implement appropriate processes related to applicable requirements laws and regulations governing cyber incidents could require us to notify customers employees or other groups and could result in adverse publicity loss of sales and cash flows increased fees payable to third parties and fines penalties or remediation and other costs that could adversely affect our reputation business and results of operations any other material disruption or other adverse event affecting one or more of our digital ordering platforms including for instance power loss technological failures user error or cyberattacks could similarly result in adverse publicity loss of sales and cash flows and other costs which could in turn materially and adversely affect our reputation business and results of operations 

we cannot predict the impact that new or improved technologies alternative methods of delivery including autonomous vehicle delivery or changes in consumer behavior facilitated by these technologies and alternative methods of delivery will have on our business 

advances in technologies or alternative methods of delivery including advances in digital ordering technology or certain changes in consumer behavior driven by these or other technologies and methods of delivery could have a negative effect on our business and market position moreover technology and consumer offerings continue to develop and we expect that new or enhanced technologies and consumer offerings will be available in the future we may pursue certain of those technologies and consumer offerings if we believe they offer a sustainable customer proposition and can be successfully integrated into our business model however we cannot predict consumer acceptance of these delivery channels or their impact on our business 

 

in addition our competitors some of whom have greater resources financial or otherwise than we do may be able to benefit from changes in technologies or consumer acceptance of alternative methods of delivery which could harm our competitive position there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully respond to changing consumer preferences including with respect to new technologies and alternative methods of delivery or to effectively adjust our product mix service offerings and marketing and merchandising initiatives for products and services that address and anticipate advances in technology and market trends if we are not able to successfully respond to these challenges our business market share financial condition and operating results could be materially and adversely affected 

we are subject to a variety of additional risks associated with our franchisees 

our franchise system subjects us to a number of additional risks any one of which may impact our ability to collect royalty payments and fees from our franchisees may harm the goodwill associated with our brand andor may materially and adversely impact our business and results of operations such risks may also apply to us as owners of stores these risks include but are not limited to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we are subject to a number of risks related to credit card and debit card payments we accept 

as store operators we and our franchisees accept payments through credit card and debit card transactions for credit card and debit card payments we and our franchisees pay interchange and other fees which may increase over time potentially increasing our operating expenses and those of our franchisees and requiring an increase in the prices charged for our products either of which could harm our operating results if there are malfunctions or other problems with our or our franchisees’ processing vendors billing software or payment processing systems our or our franchisees’ customer satisfaction may be adversely affected and one or more of the major payment networks could disallow us or our franchisees’ continued use of their payment methods if we or our franchisees fail to adequately control fraudulent credit card and debit card transactions or to comply with the payment card industry data security standards we or our franchisees may face civil liability diminished public perception of our or their security measures fines and assessments from the card brands and significantly higher credit card and debit card related costs each of which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

the termination of our ability to process payments through any major payment network would significantly impair our ability to operate our business we and our franchisees may need to expand or change our or their information systems to support different or emerging forms of payment methods which may be timeconsuming and expensive and we or they may not realize a return on the investment 

our current insurance coverage may not be adequate insurance premiums for such coverage may increase and we may not be able to obtain insurance at acceptable rates or at all 

for certain periods prior to december 1998 and for periods after december 2001 we maintain insurance coverage for workers’ compensation general liability and owned and nonowned

automobile liabilities we are generally responsible for up to 20 million per occurrence under these retention programs for workers’ compensation and general liability depending on policy year and line of coverage we are generally responsible for up to between 500000 and 55 million per occurrence under these retention programs for owned and nonowned

automobile liabilities depending on policy year and line of coverage total insurance limits under these retention programs vary depending upon the period covered and range up to 1100 million per occurrence for general liability and owned and nonowned

automobile liabilities and up to the applicable statutory limits for workers’ compensation these insurance policies may not be adequate to protect us from liabilities that we incur in our business in addition in the future our insurance premiums may increase and we may not be able to obtain similar levels of insurance on reasonable terms or at all any such inadequacy of or inability to obtain insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

risks related to our indebtedness 

our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our business and limit our ability to plan for or respond to changes in our business 

we have a substantial amount of indebtedness as of january 3 2021 our consolidated total indebtedness was approximately 412 billion we may also incur additional debt which would not be prohibited under the terms of our current securitized debt agreements our substantial indebtedness could have important consequences for our business and our shareholders for example it could 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

further a portion of our indebtedness bears interest at fluctuating interest rates based on the london interbank offered rate “libor” and there is currently uncertainty around whether libor will continue to exist after 2021 if libor ceases to exist we may need to renegotiate certain loan documents and we cannot predict what alternative index would be negotiated with our lenders as a result our interest expense could increase in which event we may have difficulties making interest payments and funding our other fixed costs and our available cash flow for general corporate requirements may be adversely affected the us federal reserve in conjunction with the alternative reference rates committee a steering committee comprised of large us financial institutions is considering replacing libor with a new index calculated by shortterm repurchase agreements backed by treasury securities called the secured overnight financing rate “sofr” the first publication of sofr was released in april 2018 whether or not sofr attains market traction as a libor replacement remains a question and the future of libor at this time is uncertain 

in addition the financial and other covenants we agreed to with our lenders may limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness make investments pay dividends and engage in other transactions and the leverage may cause potential lenders to be less willing to loan funds to us in the future our failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default that if not cured or waived could result in the acceleration of repayment of all of our indebtedness 

downgrades in our credit ratings could impact our ability to access capital and materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

our debt is rated by credit rating agencies these agencies may downgrade their credit ratings for us based on the performance of our business our capital strategies or their overall view of our industry there can be no assurance that any rating assigned to our currently outstanding indebtedness will remain in effect for any given period of time or that any such ratings will not be lowered suspended or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if in that agency’s judgment circumstances so warrant 

 

a downgrade of our credit ratings could among other things increase our cost of borrowing limit our ability to access capital result in more restrictive covenants in agreements governing the terms of any future indebtedness that we may incur including restrictions on our ability to pay dividends or repurchase shares or require us to provide collateral for future borrowings and thereby adversely impact our business financial condition and results of operations 

we may be unable to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our significant debt service obligations which would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

our ability to make principal and interest payments on and to refinance our indebtedness will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future this to a certain extent is subject to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control if our business does not generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the amounts projected or at all or if future borrowings are not available to us under our variable funding notes in amounts sufficient to fund our other liquidity needs our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected if we cannot generate sufficient cash flow from operations to make scheduled principal amortization and interest payments on our debt obligations in the future we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity sell assets delay capital expenditures or seek additional equity if we are unable to refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all or to affect any other action relating to our indebtedness on satisfactory terms or at all our business may be harmed 

the terms of our securitized debt financing of certain of our whollyowned subsidiaries have restrictive terms and our failure to comply with any of these terms could put us in default which would have an adverse effect on our business and prospects 

unless and until we repay all outstanding borrowings under our securitized debt we will remain subject to the restrictive terms of these borrowings the securitized debt under which certain of our whollyowned subsidiaries issued and guaranteed fixed rate notes and variable funding senior revolving notes contain a number of covenants with the most significant financial covenant being a debt service coverage calculation these covenants limit the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to among other things 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the securitized debt also requires us to maintain specified financial ratios at the end of each fiscal quarter these restrictions could affect our ability to pay dividends or repurchase shares of our common stock our ability to meet these financial ratios can be affected by events beyond our control and we may not satisfy such a test a breach of this covenant could result in a rapid amortization event or default under the securitized debt if amounts owed under the securitized debt are accelerated because of a default under the securitized debt and we are unable to pay such amounts the investors may have the right to assume control of substantially all of the securitized assets 

during the term following issuance the outstanding senior notes will accrue interest in accordance with the terms of the debt agreements additionally our senior notes have original scheduled principal payments of 420 million in 2021 8970 million in 2022 330 million in each of 2023 and 2024 115 billion in 2025 208 million in 2026 128 billion in 2027 68 million in 2028 and 6143 million in 2029 in accordance with our debt agreements the payment of principal on the outstanding senior notes may be suspended if the leverage ratios for the company are less than or equal to 50x total debt as defined to adjusted ebitda as defined in the indenture governing our securitized debt and no catchup

provisions are applicable as of the fourth quarter of 2020 we met the leverage ratio of less than 50x and in accordance with our debt agreements did not make the previously scheduled debt payments beginning in the first quarter of 2021 

if we are unable to refinance or repay amounts under the securitized debt prior to the expiration of the term our cash flow would be directed to the repayment of the securitized debt and other than a weekly management fee sufficient to cover minimal selling general and administrative expenses would not be available for operating our business 

no assurance can be given that any refinancing or additional financing will be possible when needed or that we will be able to negotiate acceptable terms in addition our access to capital is affected by prevailing conditions in the financial and capital markets and other factors beyond our control there can be no assurance that market conditions will be favorable at the times that we require new or additional financing 

 

the indenture governing the securitized debt will restrict the cash flow from the entities subject to the securitization to any of our other entities and upon the occurrence of certain events cash flow would be further restricted 

in the event that a rapid amortization event occurs under the indenture including without limitation upon an event of default under the indenture or the failure to repay the securitized debt at the end of its term the funds available to us would be reduced or eliminated which would in turn reduce our ability to operate or grow our business 

regulatory legal and compliance risks 

we face risks of litigation investigations enforcement actions and negative publicity from customers franchisees suppliers employees regulators and others in the ordinary course of business which could divert our financial and management resources litigation investigations enforcement actions or publicity may adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations 

claims of illness or injury relating to food quality or food handling are common in the food service industry and vehicular accidents and injuries occur in the food delivery business we are currently subject to these types of claims and have been subject to these types of claims in the past claims within our industry of improper supplier actions also occasionally arise that if made against one of our suppliers could potentially damage our brand image in addition class action lawsuits have been filed and may continue to be filed against various quick service restaurants alleging among other things that quick service restaurants have failed to disclose the health risks associated with highfat

foods and that quick service restaurant marketing practices have encouraged obesity state attorney general offices or other regulators have initiated and may in the future initiate investigations or enforcement actions against us 

in addition to decreasing our sales and profitability and diverting our management resources adverse publicity resulting from such allegations may materially and adversely affect us and our brand regardless of whether such allegations are valid or whether we are liable and could result in a substantial settlement fine penalty or judgment against us 

further we may be subject to employee franchisee and other claims in the future based on among other things discrimination harassment working and safety conditions wrongful termination and wage expense reimbursement rest break and meal break issues including claims relating to overtime compensation we have been and continue to be subject to these types of claims if one or more of these claims were to be successful or if there is a significant increase in the number of these claims or if we receive significant negative publicity our business financial condition and operating results could be harmed 

we and our franchisees are subject to extensive government regulation and requirements issued by other groups and our failure to comply with existing or increased regulations could adversely affect our business and operating results 

we are subject to numerous federal state local and foreign laws and regulations as well as requirements issued by other groups including those relating to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we are subject to an ftc rule and to various state and foreign laws that govern the offer and sale of franchises these laws regulate various aspects of the franchise relationship including terminations and the refusal to renew franchises the failure to comply with these laws and regulations in any jurisdiction or to obtain required government approvals could result in a ban or temporary suspension on future franchise sales fines or other penalties or require us to make offers of rescission or restitution any of which could adversely affect our business and operating results 

 

in august 2015 the national labor relations board adopted a new and broader standard for determining when two or more otherwise unrelated employers may be found to be a joint employer of the same employees under the national labor relations act the national labor relations board issued a final rule which became effective april 27 2020 that reinstates the standard that was in place before august 2015 in december 2019 the national labor relations board directed an administrative law judge to approve settlement agreements rather than rejecting the settlement and allowing the claims asserting that the franchisor should be the joint employer of its franchisees’ employees to proceed in a decision related to another franchise system however an appeal of that decision is pending if the august 2015 standard is restored or is adopted by other government agencies andor applied generally to franchise relationships it could cause us to be liable or held responsible for unfair labor practices and other violations of our franchisees and subject us to other liabilities and require us to conduct collective bargaining negotiations regarding employees of totally separate independent employers most notably our franchisees in such event our operating expenses may increase as a result of required modifications to our business practices increased litigation governmental investigations or proceedings administrative enforcement actions fines and civil liability additionally depending upon legal developments in california franchisors may be subject to claims that their franchisees should be treated as employees and not as independent contractors in california and potentially certain other states and localities with similar employment laws if such misclassification claims are successful against a franchisor the franchisor could be liable to its franchisees and potentially their employees and thereafter have to treat its franchisees and their employees as the franchisor’s employees under these laws 

we and our franchisees are subject to the fair labor standards act of 1938 as amended the “fair labor standards act” which along with the family and medical leave act governs such matters as minimum wage and overtime requirements and other working conditions and various family leave mandates as well as a variety of other laws enacted or rules and regulations promulgated by federal state and local governmental authorities that govern these and other employment matters we and our franchisees have experienced and expect further increases in payroll expenses as a result of governmentmandated increases in the minimum wage and although such increases are not currently expected to be material there may be material increases in the future enactment and enforcement of various federal state and local laws rules and regulations on immigration and labor organizations may adversely impact the availability and costs of labor for domino’s and franchisees’ stores in a particular area or across the united states in addition thirdparty suppliers may be affected by higher minimum wage standards which may increase the price of goods and services they supply to us such increased expenses may cause our franchisees to exit the business or cause us to reduce the number of companyowned stores or otherwise adversely affect the amount of royalty payments and license fees we receive 

on january 12 2020 the us department of labor announced a final rule to update and clarify the definition of joint employer under the fair labor standards act under the final rule the general test for assessing whether a party can be deemed a joint employer would be based upon whether that party i hires or fires the employee ii supervises and controls the employee’s work schedule or conditions of employment iii determines the employee’s rate and method of payment and iv maintains the employee’s employment records in the final rule the department of labor describes instances in which joint employment would not be more or less likely to be found to exist under the fair labor standards act which according to the department of labor includes the relationships that exist under the typical franchise business model this rule may reduce a franchisor’s risk of liability that currently exists under the joint employer standard now in effect under the fair labor standards act though ultimately the facts specific to the franchisorfranchisee model at issue would be considered when determining liability on september 8 2020 a federal district court struck down a significant portion of the final rule and an appeal of that decision is currently pending however the us department of labor rule is separate from the joint employer standard under the national labor relations act the final rule issued by the national labor relations board and as described above potential liability as a joint employer under the national labor relations act 

certain governmental authorities and private litigants have recently asserted claims against franchisors including us for provisions in our prior franchise agreements that restrict franchisees from soliciting or hiring the employees of other franchisees or the applicable franchisor claims against franchisors for such clauses include allegations that these clauses violate state and federal antitrust and unfair practices laws by restricting the free movement of employees of franchisees andor franchisor including the employees of companyowned stores thereby depressing the wages of those employees 

the patient protection and affordable care act as amended the “affordable care act” requires employers such as us to provide health insurance for all qualifying employees or pay penalties for not providing coverage the majority of the increases in these costs began in 2015 and while the incremental costs of this program have not been material to us to date we cannot predict what effect these costs will have on our results of operations and financial position or the effects of the affordable care act on some of our larger franchisees modifications to or repeal of all or certain provisions of the affordable care act are possible consistent with statements made by certain elected officials 

 

changes in tax laws or tax policy more broadly increases in the enacted tax rates adverse outcomes in connection with tax audits in any jurisdiction or any change in the pronouncements relating to accounting for income taxes could also impact our financial condition and results of operations 

there also has been increased public focus including by us and foreign governmental authorities on environmental sustainability matters such as climate change the reduction of greenhouse gases and water consumption legislative regulatory or other efforts to combat climate change or other environmental concerns could result in future increases in taxes restrictions on or increases in the costs of supplies transportation and utilities any of which could increase our operating costs and those of our franchisees and necessitate future investments in facilities and equipment these risks also include the increased pressure to make commitments set targets or establish additional goals to take actions to meet them which could expose us and our franchisees to market operational execution and reputational costs or risks 

we may also become subject to legislation or regulation seeking to tax andor regulate highfat

foods foods with high sugar and salt content or foods otherwise deemed to be “unhealthy” and our capital expenditures could increase due to remediation and compliance measures related to these laws or regulations 

adverse government regulations and enforcement efforts including the examples mentioned above or noncompliance

by us or our franchisees with any of the foregoing laws and regulations could lead to various claims or governmental or judicial fines sanctions or other enforcement measures which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

market and general risks 

adverse global economic conditions subject us to additional risk

our financial condition and results of operations are impacted by global markets and economic conditions over which neither we nor our franchisees have control an economic downturn including deterioration in the economic conditions in the us or international markets where we compete may result in a reduction in the demand for our products longer payment cycles slower adoption of new technologies and increased price competition

poor economic conditions may adversely affect the ability of our franchisees to pay royalties or amounts owed and could have a material adverse impact on our ability to pursue our growth strategy which would reduce cash collections and in turn may materially and adversely affect our ability to service our debt obligations 

fluctuations in the value of the us dollar in relation to other currencies may lead to lower revenues and earnings 

exchange rate fluctuations could have an adverse effect on our results of operations international franchise royalties and fees represented approximately 61 of our total revenues in 2020 67 of our total revenues in 2019 and 65 of our total revenues in 2018 a majority of which were denominated in foreign currencies we also operate dough manufacturing and distribution facilities in canada which generate revenues denominated in canadian dollars sales made by franchise stores outside the us are denominated in the currency of the country in which the store is located and this currency could become less valuable in us dollars as a result of exchange rate fluctuations unfavorable currency fluctuations could lead to increased prices to customers outside the us or lower profitability to our franchisees outside the us or could result in lower revenues for us on a us dollar basis from such customers and franchisees a hypothetical 10 adverse change in the foreign currency rates in our international markets would have resulted in a negative impact on international royalty revenues of approximately 222 million in 2020 

our annual and quarterly financial results are subject to significant fluctuations depending on various factors many of which are beyond our control and if we fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors our share price may decline significantly or be subject to significant fluctuations 

our sales and operating results can vary significantly from quartertoquarter

and yeartoyear

depending on various factors many of which are beyond our control these factors include among other things 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as a result our operational performance may decline quickly and significantly in response to changes in order patterns or rapid decreases in demand for our products any such decline may cause us and our franchisees to experience lower sales revenue we anticipate that fluctuations in operating results will continue in the future and such fluctuations may result in significant fluctuations or a significant decline in our share price 

actions of activist investors could negatively impact our business and the value of our stock price 

publiclytraded companies have increasingly become subject to activist investor campaigns responding to actions of an activist investor may be a significant distraction for our management and staff and could require us to expend significant time and resources including legal fees and potential proxy solicitation expenses any of these conditions could materially adversely affect our financial performance

in this section we discuss the results of our operations for the year ended january 3 2021 compared to the year ended december 29 2019 for a discussion of the year ended december 29 2019 compared to the year ended december 30 2018 please refer to part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in our annual report on form 10k

for the year ended december 29 2019 

description of the business 

domino’s is the largest pizza company in the world based on global retail sales with more than 17600 locations in over 90 markets around the world founded in 1960 our roots are in convenient pizza delivery while a significant amount of our sales also come from carryout customers although we are a highlyrecognized global brand we focus on serving neighborhoods locally through our large network of franchise owners and companyowned stores 

our business model is straightforward domino’s stores handcraft and serve quality food at a competitive price with easy ordering access and efficient service enhanced by our technological innovations our handtossed dough is made fresh and distributed to stores around the world by us and our franchisees 

domino’s generates revenues and earnings by charging royalties and fees to our independent franchisees we also generate revenues and earnings by selling food equipment and supplies to franchisees primarily in the us and canada and by operating a number of companyowned stores in the us franchisees profit by selling pizza and other complementary items to their local customers in our international markets we generally grant geographical rights to the domino’s pizza brand to master franchisees these master franchisees are charged with developing their geographical area and they can profit by subfranchising

and selling food and equipment to those subfranchisees

as well as by running pizza stores directly everyone in the system can benefit including the end consumer who can feed their family conveniently and economically 

our financial results are driven largely by retail sales at our franchise and companyowned stores changes in retail sales are driven by changes in same store sales and store counts we monitor both of these metrics very closely as they directly impact our revenues and profits and we strive to consistently increase both metrics retail sales drive royalty payments from franchisees as well as companyowned store and supply chain revenues retail sales are primarily impacted by the strength of the domino’s pizza ®

brand the results of our extensive advertising through various media channels the impact of technological innovation and digital ordering our ability to execute our strong and proven business model and the overall global economic environment 

our business model can yield strong returns for our franchise owners and our companyowned stores it can also yield significant cash flow to us through a consistent franchise royalty payment and supply chain revenue stream with moderate capital expenditures we have historically returned cash to shareholders through dividend payments and share repurchases since becoming a publiclytraded company in 2004 these factors emphasize our focus on our stakeholders including our customers team members franchisees communities and shareholders 

 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of these financial statements requires our management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis our management evaluates its estimates including those related to revenue recognition longlived assets insurance and legal matters sharebased payments and income taxes we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from those estimates changes in our accounting policies and estimates could materially impact our results of operations and financial condition for any particular period we believe that our most critical accounting policies and estimates are 

revenue recognition

 we earn revenues through our network of us companyowned and franchised stores dough manufacturing and supply chain centers and international operations retail sales from franchised stores are reported to us by our franchisees and are not included in our revenues retail sales from companyowned stores and royalty revenues resulting from the retail sales from franchised stores are recognized as revenues when the items are delivered to or carried out by customers retail sales are generally reported and the related royalties paid to us based on a percentage of retail sales as specified in the related standard franchise agreement generally 55 of us franchise retail sales and were on average 29 of international franchise retail sales in 2020 us and international franchise fee revenue primarily relates to pertransaction

technology fees that are recognized as the related sales occur we also generate revenues from us franchise advertising contributions to dnaf our consolidated notforprofit

advertising fund generally 60 of us franchise retail sales although these revenues are restricted to be used only for advertising and promotional activities to benefit franchised stores we have determined there are not performance obligations associated with the franchise advertising contributions received by dnaf that are separate from our us royalty payment stream and as a result these franchise contributions and the related expenses are presented gross in the consolidated statements of income revenues from companyowned stores and revenues from franchised stores including us franchise royalties and fees and us franchise advertising revenues can fluctuate from timetotime

as a result of store count and sales level changes sales of food from our supply chain centers are recognized as revenues upon delivery of the food to franchisees while sales of equipment and supplies are generally recognized as revenues upon shipment of the related products to franchisees 

longlived assets

we record longlived assets including property plant and equipment and capitalized software at cost for acquisitions of franchise operations we estimate the fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired based on physical inspection of assets historical experience and other information available to us regarding the acquisition we depreciate and amortize longlived assets using useful lives determined by us based on historical experience and other information available to us we evaluate the potential impairment of longlived assets at least annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable our evaluation is based on various analyses including the projection of undiscounted cash flows for companyowned stores we perform related impairment tests on an operating market basis which we have determined to be the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of other cash flows if the carrying amount of a longlived asset exceeds the amount of the expected future undiscounted cash flows of that asset we estimate the fair value of the asset if the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset an impairment loss is recognized and the asset is written down to its estimated fair value 

we have not made any significant changes in the methodology used to project the future market cash flows of companyowned stores during the years presented same store sales fluctuations and the rates at which operating costs will fluctuate in the future are key factors in evaluating recoverability of the related assets if our same store sales significantly decline or if operating costs increase and we are unable to recover these costs the carrying value of our companyowned stores by market may be unrecoverable and we may be required to recognize an impairment charge 

insurance and legal matters

we are a party to lawsuits and legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business management closely monitors these legal matters and estimates the probable costs for the resolution of such matters these estimates are primarily determined by consulting with both internal and external parties handling the matters and are based upon an analysis of potential results assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies legal judgments can be volatile and difficult to predict accordingly if our estimates relating to legal matters proved inaccurate for any reason we may be required to increase or decrease the related expense in future periods we had accruals for legal matters of approximately 13 million and 18 million at january 3 2021 december 29 2019 respectively 

 

for certain periods prior to december 1998 and for periods after december 2001 we maintain insurance coverage for workers’ compensation general liability and owned and nonowned

auto liabilities we are generally responsible for up to 20 million per occurrence under these retention programs for workers’ compensation and general liability depending on policy year and line of coverage we are generally responsible for up to between 500000 and 55 million per occurrence under these retention programs for owned and nonowned

automobile liabilities depending on policy year and line of coverage the related insurance reserves are based on undiscounted independent actuarial estimates which are based on historical information along with assumptions about future events analyses of historical trends and actuarial valuation methods are utilized to estimate the ultimate claim costs for claims incurred as of the balance sheet date and for claims incurred but not yet reported when estimating these liabilities several factors are considered including the severity duration and frequency of claims legal cost associated with claims healthcare trends and projected inflation 

our methodology for determining our exposure has remained consistent throughout the years presented management believes that the various assumptions developed and actuarial methods used to determine our insurance reserves are reasonable and provide meaningful data that management uses to make its best estimate of our exposure to these risks changes in assumptions for such factors as medical costs and legal actions as well as changes in actual experience could cause our estimates to change in the near term which could result in an increase or decrease in the related expense in future periods a 10 change in our insurance liability at january 3 2021 would have affected our income before provision for income taxes by approximately 64 million in 2020 we had accruals for insurance matters of approximately 635 million and 584 million at january 3 2021 and december 29 2019 respectively 

sharebased payments

we recognize compensation expense related to our sharebased compensation arrangements over the requisite service period based on the grant date fair value of the awards the grant date fair value of each restricted stock and performancebased restricted stock award is equal to the market price of our stock on the date of grant the grant date fair value of each stock option award is estimated using the blackscholes option pricing model the pricing model requires assumptions including the expected life of the stock option the riskfree interest rate the expected dividend yield and expected volatility of our stock over the expected life which significantly impact the assumed fair value we account for forfeitures as they occur additionally our stock option restricted stock and performancebased restricted stock arrangements provide for accelerated vesting and the ability to exercise during the remainder of the tenyear

stock option life upon the retirement of individuals holding the awards who have achieved specified service and age requirements management believes that the methods and various assumptions used to determine compensation expense related to these arrangements are reasonable but if the assumptions change significantly for future grants sharebased compensation expense will fluctuate in future years 

income taxes

we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities we measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using current enacted tax rates that will apply in the years in which we expect the temporary differences to be recovered or paid judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes related reserves and deferred tax assets and liabilities these include establishing a valuation allowance related to the ability to realize certain deferred tax assets if necessary on an ongoing basis management will assess whether it remains more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized our accounting for deferred tax assets and liabilities represents our best estimate of future events our deferred tax assets assume that we will generate sufficient taxable income in specific tax jurisdictions based on our estimates and assumptions changes in our current estimates due to unanticipated events could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

fiscal 2020 highlights 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

during 2020 we experienced global retail sales growth and us and international same store sales growth we believe our commitment to value convenience quality and new products continues to keep consumers engaged with the brand we launched three new products in the us including new and improved chicken wings and the new chicken taco and cheeseburger specialty pizzas each of which has been positively received by consumers 

 

we also continued our strong us and international same store sales performance with 39 straight quarters of positive us same store sales and 108 straight quarters of positive international same store sales beginning at the end of the first quarter of 2020 changes in consumer ordering behavior due to the covid19

pandemic resulted in a significant increase in us same store sales we did not experience significant temporary closures in our us business additionally our us supply chain experienced higher volumes from the increases in us store sales the covid19

pandemic negatively impacted our international franchise revenues during the second quarter of 2020 due to temporary store closures in certain markets as well as changes in operating procedures and store hours resulting from actions taken to increase social distancing across our international franchise markets in the third and fourth quarters of 2020 these negative impacts lessened due to the reopening and resumption of normal store hours at the majority of our international franchised stores that had been temporarily closed for portions of the second quarter our us and international same store sales growth has also been pressured by our fortressing strategy which includes increasing store concentration in certain markets where we compete as well as from aggressive competitive activity 

during 2020 we continued our global expansion with the opening of 624 net stores we had 229 net stores open in the us and 395 net stores open internationally although 718 gross stores opened internationally 323 stores closed primarily in india and south africa the covid19

pandemic has had a negative impact on anticipated store openings in our international business todate

due to delays in approvals and government restrictions in certain of the markets that our master franchisees operate 

we remained focused on improving the customer experience through our technology initiatives including the recent launch of our gps delivery tracking technology which allows customers to monitor the progress of their food from the preparation stages to the time it is in the oven to the time it arrives at their doors additionally in mid2020

we launched a new way to order contactless carryout nationwide – via domino’s carside delivery ™

 which customers can choose when placing a prepaid online order our emphasis on technological innovation helped the domino’s system generate more than half of global retail sales from digital channels in 2020 

overall we believe our global store growth strong sales emphasis on technology operations and marketing initiatives have combined to strengthen our brand 

statistical measures 

the tables below outline certain statistical measures we utilize to analyze our performance this historical data is not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for any future period 

global retail sales growth excluding foreign currency impact 

global retail sales growth excluding foreign currency impact is a commonly used statistical measure in the quickservice restaurant industry that is important to understanding performance global retail sales growth refers to total worldwide retail sales at companyowned and franchise stores we believe global retail sales information is useful in analyzing revenues because franchisees pay royalties and in the us advertising fees that are based on a percentage of franchise retail sales we review comparable industry global retail sales information to assess business trends and to track the growth of the domino’s pizza brand in addition supply chain revenues are directly impacted by changes in franchise retail sales in the us and canada retail sales for franchise stores are reported to us by our franchisees and are not included in our revenues global retail sales growth excluding foreign currency impact is calculated as the change of international local currency global retail sales against the comparable period of the prior year global retail sales growth in 2020 includes the favorable impact of the 53 rd

week 

 

 

 

same store sales growth 

same store sales growth is a commonly used statistical measure in the quickservice restaurant industry that is important to understanding performance same store sales growth is calculated for a given period by including only sales from stores that also had sales in the comparable weeks of both years international same store sales growth is calculated similarly to us same store sales growth changes in international same store sales are reported on a constant dollar basis which reflects changes in international local currency sales the 53 rd

revenues primarily consist of retail sales from our companyowned stores advertising contributions royalties and fees from our us franchised stores royalties and fees from our international franchised stores and sales of food equipment and supplies from our supply chain centers to substantially all of our us franchised stores and certain international franchised stores companyowned store and franchised store revenues may vary from period to period due to changes in store count mix supply chain revenues may vary significantly as a result of fluctuations in commodity prices as well as the mix of products we sell 

consolidated revenues increased 4986 million or 138 in 2020 due primarily to higher us retail sales which resulted in higher supply chain and us franchise revenues the inclusion of the 53 rd

week in 2020 also positively impacted revenues by an estimated 884 million us companyowned stores revenues increased in 2020 due to same store sales growth but were partially offset by lower revenues due to the sale of 59 companyowned stores to certain of our existing us franchisees during the second quarter of 2019 the “2019 store sale” these changes in revenues are described in more detail below 

us stores revenues 

 

 

us companyowned stores 

revenues from us companyowned store operations increased 320 million or 71 in 2020 due primarily to same store sales growth as well as an estimated 106 million impact of the 53 rd

week the increase in revenues was partially offset by lower revenues resulting from the 2019 store sale us companyowned same store sales increased 110 in 2020 and increased 28 in 2019

revenues from us franchise royalties and fees increased 747 million or 174 in 2020 due primarily to higher same store sales and an increase in the average number of us franchised stores open during the period resulting from net store growth as well as an estimated 114 million impact of the 53 rd

week us franchise royalties were negatively impacted by approximately 30 million related to funding we provided to our franchisees for an effort to donate 10 million slices of pizza to people and organizations at the frontlines of the covid19

pandemic in the franchisees’ local communities us franchise same store sales increased 115 in 2020 and increased 32 in 2019 us franchise royalties and fees further benefited from an increase in revenues from fees paid by franchisees for the use of our technology platforms 

us franchise advertising 

revenues from us franchise advertising increased 714 million or 183 in 2020 due primarily to higher same store sales and an increase in the average number of us franchised stores open during the year resulting from net store growth as well as an estimated 104 million impact of the 53 rd

week 

 

supply chain 

supply chain revenues increased 3118 million or 148 in 2020 due primarily to higher volumes from increased orders resulting from us franchise retail sales growth as well as an estimated 496 million impact of the 53 rd

week our market basket pricing to stores increased 22 during 2020 which resulted in an estimated 425 million increase in supply chain revenues 

international franchise royalties and fees 

revenues from international franchise operations increased 88 million or 36 in 2020 this increase was due primarily to an estimated 64 million impact of the 53 rd

week as well as same store sales growth and an increase in the average number of international franchised stores open during the period due to net store growth excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rates international same store sales increased 44 in 2020 and increased 19 in 2019 the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates negatively impacted revenue from international royalties and fees by approximately 39 million in 2020 temporary store closures in certain markets and changes in operating procedures and store hours resulting from actions taken to increase social distancing across certain of the markets in which we operate as well as targeted financial relief provided to certain of our master franchisees due to the covid19

pandemic also had a negative impact on international franchise revenues in 2020 

cost of sales  operating margin 

 

 

consolidated cost of sales consists primarily of us companyowned store and supply chain costs incurred to generate related revenues components of consolidated cost of sales primarily include food labor delivery and occupancy costs we estimate the 53 rd

week resulted in an increase of approximately 506 million on consolidated cost of sales 

consolidated operating margin which we define as revenues less cost of sales increased 1920 million or 137 in 2020 due primarily to higher global franchise revenues and higher supply chain volumes as well as an estimated 378 million impact of the 53 rd

week franchise revenues do not have a cost of sales component so changes in these revenues have a disproportionate effect on the operating margin 

as a percentage of revenues the consolidated operating margin decreased 01 percentage points in 2020 companyowned store operating margin decreased 19 percentage points in 2020 and supply chain operating margin increased 01 percentage points in 2020 these changes in operating margin are more fully discussed below 

us companyowned stores operating margin 

 

 

us companyowned store operating margin which does not include other storelevel costs such as royalties and advertising decreased 14 million or 13 in 2020 due primarily to higher labor costs and to a lesser extent higher food costs lower revenues resulting from the 2019 store sale also contributed to the decrease in us companyowned store operating margin these decreases were partially offset by higher revenues resulting from higher same store sales as well as an estimated 32 million impact of the 53 rd

week as a percentage of store revenues the store operating margin decreased 19 percentage points in 2020 these changes in operating margin as a percentage of revenues are discussed in more detail below 

 

 

 

 

 

supply chain operating margin 

 

 

supply chain operating margin increased 385 million or 164 in 2020 primarily driven by higher volumes from increased orders as well as an estimated 64 million impact of the 53 rd

week as a percentage of supply chain revenues the supply chain operating margin increased 01 percentage points in 2020 due primarily to lower delivery costs as a percentage of revenues as a result of leveraging of higher same store sales and lower fuel prices partially offset by higher food costs 

general and administrative expenses 

general and administrative expenses increased 243 million or 64 in 2020 driven primarily by higher variable performancebased compensation expense and professional fees as well as an estimated 56 million impact of the 53 rd

week these increases were partially offset by lower travel expenses resulting from travel restrictions associated with the covid19

pandemic 

us franchise advertising expenses 

us franchise advertising expenses increased 714 million or 183 in 2020 due to higher us franchise advertising revenue including an estimated 104 million impact of the 53 rd

week us franchise advertising costs are accrued and expensed when the related us franchise advertising revenues are recognized as our consolidated notforprofit

advertising fund is obligated to expend such revenues on advertising and these revenues cannot be used for general corporate purposes 

interest expense net 

interest expense net increased 237 million or 161 in 2020 driven primarily by higher average debt balances resulting from the 2019 recapitalization and borrowings under the company’s variable funding notes in 2020 as well as an estimated 26 million impact of the 53 rd

week 

our weighted average borrowing rate decreased to 39 in 2020 from 41 in 2019 resulting from the lower interest rates on the debt outstanding in 2020 as compared to the same periods in 2019 

provision for income taxes 

provision for income taxes decreased 181 million or 221 in 2020 and the effective tax rate decreased to 115 in 2020 as compared to 170 in 2019 due primarily to higher excess tax benefits on equitybased compensation which are recorded as a reduction to the income tax provision excess tax benefits from equitybased compensation were 604 million in 2020 and were 257 million in 2019 the increase in excess tax benefits resulted from a significant increase in stock options exercised in 2020 as compared to 2019 the decrease in provision for income taxes was partially offset by higher pretax

income and to a lesser extent an increase in the valuation allowance associated with foreign tax credits and interest deductibility in separatelyfiled states we estimate the 53 rd

week resulted in an increase of 40 million on the provision for income taxes 

segment income 

we evaluate the performance of our reportable segments and allocate resources to them based on earnings before interest taxes depreciation amortization and other referred to as segment income segment income for each of our reportable segments is summarized in the table below other segment income primarily includes corporate administrative costs that are not allocable to an operating segment including labor computer expenses professional fees travel and entertainment rent insurance and other corporate administrative costs 

 

 

 

us stores 

us stores segment income increased 734 million or 203 in 2020 primarily as a result of the increase in revenues from us franchise royalties and fees of 747 million discussed above us franchise revenues do not have a cost of sales component so changes in these revenues have a disproportionate effect on us stores segment income us franchise advertising costs are accrued and expensed when the related us franchise advertising revenues are recognized and have no impact on us stores segment income the increase in us stores segment income was partially offset by the 14 million decrease in us companyowned store operating margin discussed above 

supply chain 

supply chain segment income increased 386 million or 193 in 2020 due primarily to the 385 million increase in operating margin described above 

international franchise 

international franchise segment income increased 103 million or 55 in 2020 due primarily to the 88 million increase in international franchise revenues discussed above international franchise revenues do not have a cost of sales component so changes in these revenues have a disproportionate effect on international franchise segment income lower travel expenses primarily due to travel restrictions resulting from the covid19

pandemic also contributed to the increase in international franchise segment income 

other 

other segment income decreased 166 million or 451 in 2020 due primarily to higher variable performancebased compensation expense the decrease in other segment income was partially offset by higher corporate administrative costs allocated to our segments as compared to 2019 the increase in allocated costs in 2020 was due primarily to higher investments in technological initiatives to support technology for our us and international franchise stores 

new accounting pronouncements 

the impact of new accounting pronouncements adopted and the estimated impact of new accounting pronouncements that we will adopt in future years is included in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements 

covid19

impact 

as of january 3 2021 nearly all of our us stores were open with stores deploying contactless delivery and carryout solutions based on information reported to us by our master franchisees we estimate that as of january 3 2021 there were fewer than 150 international stores temporarily closed 

given the market uncertainty arising from covid19

we took a precautionary measure and borrowed 1580 million under our variable funding notes during the second quarter of 2020 which was fully repaid throughout the remainder of 2020 

during the covid19 pandemic

we also made certain investments related to safety and cleaning equipment enhanced sick pay and compensation for frontline team members and support for our franchisees and their communities while we have seen an increase in sales in certain markets during the covid19

pandemic including increased sales related to heightened reliance on delivery and carryout

businesses future sales are not possible to estimate and it is unclear whether and to what extent sales will return to more normalized levels if and when consumer behavior and general economic and business activity return to prepandemic

levels while it is not possible at this time to estimate the full continued impact that covid19

could have on our business the continued spread of covid19 and

the measures taken by the governments of countries affected could disrupt our continuing operations and supply chain and as a result could adversely impact our business financial condition or results of operations 

 

liquidity and capital resources 

historically we have operated with minimal positive working capital or negative working capital primarily because our receivable collection periods and inventory turn rates are faster than the normal payment terms on our current liabilities we generally collect our receivables within three weeks from the date of the related sale and we generally experience multiple inventory turns per month in addition our sales are not typically seasonal which further limits our working capital requirements these factors coupled with the use of our ongoing cash flows from operations to service our debt obligations invest in our business pay dividends and repurchase our common stock reduce our working capital amounts as of january 3 2021 we had working capital of 1746 million excluding restricted cash and cash equivalents of 2175 million advertising fund assets restricted of 1477 million and advertising fund liabilities of 1412 million working capital includes total unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of 1688 million 

our primary source of liquidity is cash flows from operations and availability of borrowings under our variable funding notes during 2020 we experienced increases in both us and international same store sales versus the comparable periods in the prior year additionally our us and international businesses grew store counts in 2020 these factors contributed to our continued ability to generate positive operating cash flows the company has a variable funding note facility which allows for advances of up to 2000 million of series 20191

variable funding senior secured notes class a1

notes and certain other credit instruments including letters of credit the “2019 variable funding notes” the letters of credit are primarily related to our casualty insurance programs and certain supply chain center leases given the market uncertainty arising from covid19

we took a precautionary measure and borrowed 1580 million under the 2019 variable funding notes during the second quarter of 2020 which was fully repaid throughout the remainder of 2020 as of january 3 2021 we had no outstanding borrowings and 1575 million of available borrowing capacity under our 2019 variable funding notes net of letters of credit issued of 425 million 

we expect to continue to use our unrestricted cash and cash equivalents cash flows from operations excess cash from our recapitalization transactions and available borrowings under our 2019 variable funding notes to among other things fund working capital requirements invest in our core business service our indebtedness pay dividends and repurchase our common stock 

our ability to continue to fund these items and continue to service our debt could be adversely affected by the occurrence of any of the events described in item 1a risk factors there can be no assurance that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operations or that future borrowings will be available under the 2019 variable funding notes or otherwise to enable us to service our indebtedness or to make anticipated capital expenditures our future operating performance and our ability to service extend or refinance the 2019 2018 2017 and 2015 notes and to service extend or refinance the 2019 variable funding notes will be subject to future economic conditions and to financial business and other factors many of which are beyond our control 

restricted cash 

as of january 3 2021 we had approximately 1771 million of restricted cash and cash equivalents held for future principal and interest payments and other working capital requirements of our assetbacked securitization structure 396 million of restricted cash equivalents held in a threemonth interest reserve as required by the related debt agreements and 08 million of other restricted cash for a total of 2175 million of restricted cash and cash equivalents as of january 3 2021 we also held 1159 million of advertising fund restricted cash and cash equivalents which can only be used for activities that promote the domino’s brand

sources and uses of cash 

the following table illustrates the main components of our cash flows 

 

 

 

operating activities 

cash provided by operating activities increased 958 million in 2020 due to an increase in net income of 906 million and higher noncash

amounts of 294 million these increases were partially offset by a 242 million negative impact of changes in operating assets and liabilities in 2020 as compared to 2019 which primarily related to timing of payments on accounts payable and accrued liabilities as well as increases in our inventory and accounts receivable balances associated with higher revenues these operating asset and liability changes were partially offset by an increase in net advertising fund assets and liabilities restricted in 2020 as compared to 2019 due to the receipt of advertising contributions outpacing payments for advertising activities 

we are focused on continually improving our net income and cash flow from operations and management expects to continue to generate positive cash flows from operating activities for the foreseeable future 

investing activities 

cash used in investing activities was 1289 million in 2020 which consisted primarily of capital expenditures of 888 million driven primarily by investments in supply chain centers technological initiatives and corporate stores and the investment in dash brands note 9 of 400 million

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend 

market risk 

we do not engage in speculative transactions nor do we hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes we are exposed to interest rate risk on borrowings under our 2017 fiveyear floating rate notes and our 2019 variable funding notes as of january 3 2021 we did not have any outstanding borrowings under our 2019 variable funding notes our 2017 fiveyear floating rate notes and our 2019 variable funding notes bear interest at fluctuating interest rates based on libor a hypothetical 10 adverse change in the libor rate would have resulted in higher interest expense of approximately 32 million in 2020 

there is currently uncertainty around whether libor will continue to exist after 2021 if libor ceases to exist we may need to renegotiate our loan documents and we cannot predict what alternative index would be negotiated with our lenders as a result our interest expense could increase in which event we may have difficulties making interest payments and funding our other fixed costs and our available cash flow for general corporate requirements may be adversely affected 

our fixed rate debt exposes the company to changes in market interest rates reflected in the fair value of the debt and to the risk that the company may need to refinance maturing debt with new debt at a higher rate 

we are exposed to market risks from changes in commodity prices during the normal course of business we purchase cheese and certain other food products that are affected by changes in commodity prices and as a result we are subject to volatility in our food costs we may periodically enter into financial instruments to manage this risk we do not engage in speculative transactions nor do we hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes in instances when we use fixed pricing agreements with our suppliers these agreements cover our physical commodity needs are not netsettled

and are accounted for as normal purchases 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

we have exposure to various foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations for revenues generated by our operations outside the us which can adversely impact our net income and cash flows approximately 61 of our total revenues in 2020 67 of our total revenues in 2019 and 65 of our total revenues in 2018 were derived from our international franchise segment a majority of which were denominated in foreign currencies we also operate dough manufacturing and distribution facilities in canada which generate revenues denominated in canadian dollars we do not enter into financial instruments to manage this foreign currency exchange risk a hypothetical 10 adverse change in the foreign currency rates for our international markets would have resulted in a negative impact on royalty revenues of approximately 222 million in 2020

overview 

domino’s is the largest pizza company in the world based on global retail sales with more than 17000 locations in over 90 markets around the world as of december 29 2019 founded in 1960 our roots are in convenient pizza delivery while a significant amount of our sales also come from carryout customers although we are a highlyrecognized global brand we focus on serving neighborhoods locally through our large global network of franchise owners and us companyowned stores the company is primarily a franchisor with approximately 98 of domino’s stores currently owned and operated by independent franchisees franchising enables an individual to be his or her own employer and maintain control over all employmentrelated matters and pricing decisions while also benefiting from the strength of the domino’s global brand operating system and financial resources 

the domino’s business model is straightforward domino’s stores handcraft and serve quality food at a competitive price with easy ordering access and efficient service enhanced by our technological innovations our handtossed dough is made fresh and distributed to stores around the world by us and our franchisees 

domino’s generates revenues and earnings by charging royalties and fees to our franchisees royalties are ongoing percentofsales 

fees for use of the domino’s ®

brand marks the company also generates revenues and earnings by selling food equipment and supplies to franchisees through our supply chain operations primarily in the us and canada and by operating a number of our own stores franchisees profit by selling pizza and other complementary items to their local customers in our international markets we generally grant geographical rights to the domino’s pizza ®

brand to master franchisees these master franchisees are charged with developing their geographical area and they may profit by subfranchising

and selling food and equipment to those subfranchisees 

as well as by running pizza stores we believe that everyone in the system can benefit including the end consumer who can purchase domino’s menu items for themselves and their family conveniently and economically

the domino’s business model can yield strong returns for our franchise owners and companyowned stores it can also yield significant cash flows to us through a consistent franchise royalty payment and supply chain revenue stream with moderate capital expenditures we have historically returned cash to shareholders through dividend payments and share repurchases 

our history 

we pioneered the pizza delivery business and built domino’s into one of the most widelyrecognized consumer brands in the world we have been delivering quality affordable food to our customers since 1960 when brothers thomas and james monaghan borrowed 900 to purchase a small pizza store in ypsilanti michigan thomas purchased his brother’s share of the business shortly thereafter concentrating first on building stores near college campuses and military bases in the 1960s and 1970s the brand grew quickly in the 1980s in urban markets and near residential communities we became “domino’s pizza” in 1965 and opened our first franchised store in 1967 the first international stores opened in 1983 in canada and australia monaghan sold 93 of his economic stake in the company in 1998 to bain capital llc and then later sold and transferred his remaining stake in the company in 2004 when we completed our initial public offering 

since 1998 the company has been structured with a leveraged balance sheet and has completed a number of recapitalization transactions the company’s most recent recapitalization transaction in 2019 the “2019 recapitalization” primarily consisted of the issuance of 6750 million of fixed rate notes as of december 29 2019 the company had 411 billion in total debt which included debt from its 2019 recapitalization and its previous recapitalization transactions in 2018 2017 and 2015 the “2018 recapitalization” “2017 recapitalization” and the “2015 recapitalization” respectively and together with the 2019 recapitalization the “2019 2018 2017 and 2015 recapitalizations” excess proceeds from our 2019 2018 2017 and 2015 recapitalizations were used primarily to repurchase shares of our common stock 

we relaunched

our brand in the us in late 2009 by introducing a new recipe for our core pizza product since 2008 the majority of our menu has changed either through the improvement of existing products or the introduction of new products such as our handmade pan pizza and specialty chicken during this timeframe we also began expanding our focus on technology through our development of innovative ordering platforms including those developed for google home facebook messenger apple watch amazon echo and twitter as well as other technological advancements such as the launch of our piece of the pie rewards ®

loyalty program in 2015 and the launch of domino’s delivery hotspots ®

in 2018 globally we opened our 10000 th

store in 2012 and our 17000 th

store in 2019 in 2012 we announced a plan requiring all stores to adopt our new carryout

friendly “pizza theater” store design which is more inviting to customers and allows them to see their orders being made fresh in front of them the majority of our us and international stores have completed these remodels as of the end of 2019

our industry 

the us qsr pizza category is large and fragmented from 2014 through 2019 the us qsr pizza category has grown from 348 billion to 378 billion it is the secondlargest category within the 279 billion us qsr sector the us qsr pizza category is primarily comprised of delivery dinein

and carryout with carryout and delivery comprising the two largest segments

in the us we compete primarily in the delivery and carryout segments of the pizza industry and we are the dollar market share leader for delivery and secondlargest dollar market share leader for carryout delivery segment dollars of 110 billion in 2019 up from 102 billion in 2014 account for approximately 29 of total us qsr pizza the four industry leaders including domino’s account for over 61 of us pizza delivery based on reported consumer spending with the remaining dollars going to regional chains and independent establishments from 2014 to 2019 the carryout segment grew from 169 billion to 188 billion the four industry leaders including domino’s account for approximately 51 of the carryout segment source the npd groupcrest ®

 year ending november 2019

in contrast to the us international pizza delivery is relatively underdeveloped with only domino’s and two other competitors having a significant global presence we believe that demand for pizza and pizza delivery is large and growing throughout the world driven by international consumers’ increasing emphasis on convenience and our proven success of more than 35 years of conducting business abroad 

our competition 

the global pizza delivery and carryout segments as well as the broader qsr sector are highly competitive in the us we compete against regional and local companies as well as national chains pizza hut ®

 papa john’s ®

and little caesars pizza ®

 internationally we compete primarily with pizza hut ®

 papa john’s ®

and countryspecific national and local pizzerias we generally compete on the basis of product quality location image service technology convenience and price our business and those of our competitors can be affected by changes in consumer tastes economic conditions demographic trends and consumers’ disposable income we also compete with other food food delivery and order and delivery aggregation companies we compete not only for customers but also for employees drivers suitable real estate sites and qualified franchisees 

our customers 

the company’s business is not dependent upon a single retail customer or small group of customers including franchisees no customer accounted for more than 10 of total consolidated revenues in 2019 2018 or 2017 as of december 29 2019 our largest franchisee based on store count domino’s pizza enterprises dmp asx operates 2604 stores in nine international markets and accounts for 15 of our total store count revenues from this master franchisee accounted for 14 of our consolidated revenues in 2019 our international business unit only requires a modest amount of general and administrative expenses to support its markets and does not have a cost of sales component therefore the vast majority of these royalty revenues result in profits to us 

our menu 

we offer a menu designed to present an attractive quality offering to customers while keeping it simple enough to minimize order errors and expedite ordertaking and food preparation our basic menu features pizza products with varying sizes and crust types our typical store also offers ovenbaked sandwiches pasta boneless chicken and chicken wings bread side items desserts and soft drink products international markets vary toppings by country and culture such as a squid topping in japan or spicy cheese in india and often feature regional specialty items such as a banana and cinnamon dessert pizza in brazil 

store image and operations 

we have been focused primarily on pizza delivery for nearly 60 years and we also place focus on carryout as a significant component of our business in 2012 we introduced our carryoutfriendly pizza theater store design the majority of our us and international stores have converted to this design as of the end of 2019 many stores offer casual seating and enable customers to watch the preparation of their orders but do not offer a fullservice dinein

experience as a result our stores generally do not require expensive restaurant facilities and staffing

our business segments 

we operate and report three business segments us stores international franchise and supply chain 

us stores 

our us stores segment consists primarily of our franchise operations which consist of 5784 franchised stores located in the united states we also operate a network of 342 us companyowned stores 

during 2019 our us stores segment accounted for 127 billion or 35 of our consolidated revenues directly operating domino’s stores contributes significantly to our ability to act as a credible franchisor we also use our companyowned stores as test sites for technological innovation and promotions as well as operational improvements we also use them for training new store managers and operations team members as well as developing prospective franchisees while we are primarily a franchised business we continuously evaluate our mix of us companyowned and franchise stores as of december 29 2019 franchised stores represented 94 of our total store count within our us stores segment 

us franchise profile 

as of december 29 2019 our network of 5784 us franchise stores was owned and operated by 777 independent us franchisees our franchise formula enables franchisees to benefit from our brand recognition with a relatively low initial capital investment as of december 29 2019 the average us franchisee owned and operated approximately seven stores and had been in our franchise system for over 18 years additionally 20 of our us franchisees operated more than 50 stores including our largest us franchisee who operated 176 stores and 240 of our us franchisees each operated one store 

we apply rigorous standards to prospective us franchisees we generally require them to manage a store for at least one year and graduate from our franchise management school program before being granted a franchise this enables us to observe the operational and financial performance of a potential franchisee prior to entering into a longterm agreement substantially all of our 777 independent us franchise owners started their careers with us as delivery drivers or in other instore

positions which we believe offers advantages in terms of familiarity with our business and store operations in addition we generally restrict the ability of us franchisees to be involved in other businesses which we believe helps focus our franchisees’ attention on operating their stores we believe these characteristics and standards are largely unique within the franchise industry and have resulted in qualified and focused franchisees operating domino’s stores we maintain a productive relationship with our independent franchise owners through regional franchise teams distributing materials that help franchise stores comply with our standards and using franchise advisory groups that facilitate communications between us and our franchisees we consider our relationship with our us franchisees to be good

us franchise agreements 

we enter into franchise agreements with us franchisees under which the franchisee is generally granted the right to operate a store in a particular location for a term of ten years with an ability to renew for an additional term of ten years we have a franchise agreement renewal rate of approximately 99 under the current standard franchise agreement we assign an exclusive area of primary responsibility to each franchised store each franchisee is generally required to pay a 55 royalty fee on sales as well as certain technology fees in certain instances we will collect lower rates based on certain incentives 

our stores in the contiguous united states currently contribute 6 of their sales to fund national marketing and advertising campaigns subject in certain instances to lower rates based on certain incentives and waivers these funds are administered by domino’s national advertising fund inc “dnaf” our consolidated notforprofit

advertising subsidiary the funds are primarily used to purchase media for advertising and also to support market research field communications public relations commercial production talent payments and other activities to promote the domino’s brand in addition to the national and marketlevel advertising contributions us stores generally spend additional funds on local store marketing activities

we have the contractual right subject to state law to terminate a franchise agreement for a variety of reasons including but not limited to a franchisee’s failure to adhere to the company’s franchise agreement failure to make required payments or failure to adhere to specified company policies and standards 

international franchise 

our international franchise segment is comprised of a network of franchised stores in more than 90 international markets at december 29 2019 we had 10894 international franchise stores during 2019 this segment accounted for 2410 million or 7 of our consolidated revenues the principal sources of revenues from those operations are royalty payments generated by retail sales from franchised stores 

our international franchisees employ our basic standard operating model and adapt it to satisfy the local eating habits and consumer preferences of various regions outside the us currently the vast majority of our international stores operate under master franchise agreements 

we believe domino’s appeals to potential international franchisees because of our recognized brand name and technological leadership the moderate capital expenditures required to open and operate our stores and our system’s desirable store profitability stores in eight of our top ten international markets in terms of store count are operated by master franchise companies that are publicly traded on stock exchanges as noted in the below table the following table shows our store count as of december 29 2019 in our top ten international markets which accounted for approximately 63 of our international stores as of that date 

  

 

 

international franchisee profile 

the vast majority of our markets outside of the us are operated by master franchisees with franchise and distribution rights for entire regions or countries in a few select markets we franchise directly to individual store operators prospective master franchisees are required to possess local market knowledge to establish and develop domino’s stores with the ability to identify and access targeted real estate sites as well as expertise in local laws customs culture and consumer behavior we also seek candidates that have access to sufficient capital to meet growth and development plans we consider our relationship with our international franchisees to be good 

master franchise agreements 

our master franchise agreements generally grant the franchisee exclusive rights to develop and subfranchise

stores and the right to operate supply chain centers in particular geographic areas agreements are generally for a term of ten years with options to renew for additional terms the agreements typically contain growth clauses requiring franchisees to open a minimum number of stores within a specified period the master franchisee is generally required to pay an initial onetime

franchise fee as well as an additional franchise fee upon the opening of each new store the master franchisee is also required to pay a continuing royalty fee as a percentage of sales which varies among international markets and averaged approximately 30 in 2019

supply chain 

our supply chain segment operates 19 regional dough manufacturing and food supply chain centers in the us one thin crust manufacturing center one vegetable processing center and one center providing equipment and supplies to our us and certain international stores we plan to continue investing in additional supply chain centers and capacity initiatives in the future including two additional regional dough manufacturing and food supply chain centers that are expected to open in fiscal 2020 we also operate five dough manufacturing and food supply chain centers in canada our supply chain segment leases a fleet of more than 800 tractors and trailers during 2019 our supply chain segment accounted for 210 billion or 58 of our consolidated revenues 

our centers produce fresh dough and purchase receive store and deliver quality food and other complementary items to substantially all of our us stores and most of our canadian franchised stores we regularly supply over 6600 stores with various food and supplies 

we believe our franchisees voluntarily choose to obtain food supplies and equipment from us because we offer the most efficient convenient and costeffective alternative while also offering both quality and consistency our supply chain segment offers profitsharing arrangements to franchisees who purchase all of their food for their stores from our centers these profitsharing arrangements generally offer participating franchisees and companyowned stores with 50 or a higher percentage in the case of companyowned stores and certain franchisees who operate a larger number of stores of their regional supply chain center’s pretax

profits we believe these arrangements strengthen our ties to and provide aligned benefits with franchisees

thirdparty suppliers 

over half of our annual food spend is with suppliers with whom we maintain longstanding partnerships our supply partners are required to meet strict quality standards to ensure food safety we review and evaluate these partners’ quality assurance programs through among other actions onsite

visits thirdparty audits and product evaluations designed to ensure compliance with our standards we believe the length and quality of our relationships with thirdparty suppliers provides us with priority service and quality products at competitive prices

cheese is our largest food cost the price we charge to our us franchisees for cheese is formulabased with the chicago mercantile exchange cheddar block price as the primary component plus a supply chain markup as cheese prices fluctuate our revenues and margin percentages in our supply chain segment also fluctuate however actual supply chain dollar margins remain unchanged we currently purchase our us pizza cheese from a single supplier under our september 2017 agreement our us supplier agreed to provide an uninterrupted supply of cheese and the company agreed to a sevenyear pricing schedule to purchase all of its us pizza cheese from this supplier while we expect to meet the terms of this agreement if we do not we will be required to repay the certain negotiated cost savings as provided in the agreement the majority of our meat toppings in the us come from a single supplier under a contract that expires in june 2022 we have the right to terminate these arrangements for quality failures and for certain uncured breaches 

we have entered into a multiyear agreement with cocacola ®

for the us this contract renegotiated in june 2019 provides for cocacola to continue to be our exclusive beverage supplier and expires on december 31 2023 or at such time as a minimum number of cases of cocacola products are purchased by domino’s whichever occurs later 

we believe alternative thirdparty suppliers are available for all of these referenced products while we may incur additional costs if we are required to replace any of our supply partners we do not believe such additional costs would have a material adverse effect on our business we continually evaluate each supply category to determine the optimal sourcing strategy 

we have not experienced any significant shortages of supplies or delays in receiving our inventories or products prices charged to us by our supply partners are subject to fluctuation and we have historically been able to pass increased costs and savings on to stores we periodically enter into supplier contracts to manage the risk from changes in commodity prices we do not engage in speculative transactions nor do we hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes 

our strengths 

strong brand equity 

we are the largest pizza company in the world based on global retail sales we believe our domino’s brand is one of the most widelyrecognized consumer brands in the world we are the recognized world leader in pizza delivery and have a significant business in carryout we believe consumers associate our brand with the timely delivery of quality affordable food and technological innovation 

over the past five years our us franchise and companyowned stores have invested an estimated 21 billion in national cooperative

and local advertising our international franchisees also invest significant amounts in advertising efforts in their markets we continue to reinforce our brand with extensive advertising through various media channels we have also enhanced the strength of our brand through marketing affiliations with brands such as cocacola

we are the number one pizza delivery company in the us with a 35 share of pizza delivery based on consumer spending data for the year ending november 2019 for the same period we are also the number two pizza carryout company in the us with a 16 share of carryout pizza source the npd groupcrest ®

 year ending november 2019 with 6126 stores located in the us our store delivery areas cover a majority of us households our share position and scale allow us to leverage our purchasing power supply chain strength and marketing investments we believe our scale and market coverage allow us to effectively serve our customers’ demands for convenience and timely delivery outside the us we have significant market share positions in many of the markets in which we compete 

strong and proven business model 

our business model generates us and international franchise royalties and fees supply chain revenue and retail sales at companyowned stores we have developed this model over our many years of operation and it is anchored by strong storelevel economics which provide an entrepreneurial incentive for our franchisees and historically has generated demand for new stores over the past ten years average us store profitability in the domino’s system has increased meaningfully resulting in higher profitability for our franchise owners our franchise system in turn has produced strong and consistent earnings for us through royalty payments and through supply chain revenues 

we developed a costefficient store model characterized by a delivery and carryoutoriented store design with moderate capital requirements and a menu of quality affordable items at the store level we believe the simplicity and efficiency of our operations give us significant advantages over our competitors who in many cases also focus on dinein

or have broader menu offerings at the supply chain level we believe we provide quality good value and consistency for our franchise customers while also driving profits for us which we share with our franchisees under the profitsharing arrangements described above

our menu simplifies and streamlines production and delivery processes and maximizes economies of scale on purchases of our principal food items in addition our stores are generally smaller and less expensive to build furnish and maintain as compared to many other restaurant concepts new stores built in our pizza theater design are often slightly larger than stores we have built in the past to create a better experience for our carryout customers however they are still generally smaller and less expensive to build furnish and maintain than many other restaurant concepts the combination of this efficient store model and strong sales volume has resulted in strong storelevel economics and we believe makes domino’s an attractive business opportunity for existing and prospective franchisees around the world we and our franchisees are continuing to focus on growing our global store count in recent years we have focused specifically on increasing our presence in our existing markets to provide better service to our customers including shrinking our delivery areas to provide better delivery service and adding locations that are closer to our carryout customers we call this approach our fortressing strategy 

we believe our store financial returns have led to a strong welldiversified franchise system this established franchise system has produced strong cash flows and earnings for us enabling us to invest in the domino’s brand stores technology and supply chain centers pay dividends repurchase and retire shares of our common stock and service our debt obligations 

technological innovation 

technological innovation is vital to our brand and our longterm success digital ordering is critical to competing in the global pizza industry in 2019 more than half of all global retail sales were derived from digital channels primarily through our online ordering website and mobile applications we believe we are among the largest ecommerce

retailers in terms of annual transactions after launching digital ordering and the domino’s tracker ®

in the us in 2008 we made the strategic decision in 2010 to develop our own online ordering platform and to manage this important and growing area of our business internally over the next five years we launched mobile applications that cover the majority of the smartphones and tablets on the us market in 2013 we launched an enhanced online ordering profiles platform allowing customers the ability to reorder their favorite order in as few as five clicks or 30 seconds in 2014 we introduced “dom” a voice ordering application which we believe was the first in the restaurant industry and we also made the domino’s tracker available on our ordering platforms in 2015 we introduced several innovative ordering platforms including samsung smart tv ®

 twitter and text message using a pizza emoji we continued this trend of innovation in 2016 with the introduction of zeroclick

ordering as well as adding google home facebook messenger apple watch and amazon echo to our ordering platforms in april 2018 we launched domino’s delivery hotspots featuring over 200000 nontraditional

delivery locations including parks beaches local landmarks and other unique gathering spots in late 2017 we began an industryfirst test of selfdriving vehicle delivery and in june 2019 we announced a partnership with nuro furthering our exploration and testing of autonomous pizza delivery in 2019 we also opened our innovation garage which is a 33000 squarefoot building on the campus of our corporate headquarters that includes collaboration workspaces and a fully functioning pizza theater to develop and test new technology in a store setting we also launched our gps delivery tracking technology in 2019 which allows customers to track the progress of their pizza delivery through domino’s ordering platforms

the company’s piece of the pie rewards loyalty program launched in 2015 is meant to reward customers with a program that is simple to understand and easy to use upon signing up for the program customers become rewards members and can earn points for online orders when rewards members reach a certain amount of points they can redeem their points for free pizza rewards members may also receive exclusive membersonly discounts and bonus offers we may also occasionally provide additional opportunities for participating customers to benefit under the piece of the pie rewards program 

all of this improved functionality has been developed to work seamlessly with our domino’s pulse ™

pointofsale

system our domino’s pulse system is designed to drive operating efficiencies for our franchisees and our corporate management and assist franchisees in independently managing their business as of december 29 2019 domino’s pulse is being used in every companyowned store in the us in more than 99 of our us franchised stores and in approximately 76 of our international stores

we believe utilizing domino’s pulse with our integrated technology solutions throughout our system provides us with competitive advantages over other concepts 

we intend to continue to enhance and grow our online ordering digital marketing and technological capabilities

product innovation 

in late 2009 we reintroduced our core handtossed pizza in the us with a new recipe which we believe has contributed to longterm growth in customer reorder rates consumer traffic and increased sales this recipe is now in use in other markets around the world our nearly 60 years of innovation have resulted in numerous new product developments including our more recent innovations of handmade pan pizza specialty chicken parmesan bread bites stuffed cheesy bread marbled cookie brownie and bread twists among others product innovation is also present in our global markets where our master franchisees have the ability to recommend products to suit their local market tastes products include the mayo jaga in japan bacon potatoes and sweet mayonnaise and the saumoneta in france light cream potatoes onions smoked salmon and dill 

internal dough manufacturing and supply chain system 

in addition to generating significant revenues and earnings in the us and canada we believe our vertically integrated dough manufacturing and supply chain system enhances the quality and consistency of our products enhances our relationships with franchisees and leverages economies of scale to offer lower costs to our stores it also allows store managers to better focus on store operations and customer service by relieving them of the responsibility of mixing dough in the stores and sourcing other ingredients many of our international master franchisees also profit from running supply chain businesses in their respective markets 

our ideals 

we believe in opportunity hard work inspired solutions winning together embracing community and uncommon honesty 

opportunity abounds at domino’s you can start in an entrylevel position and become a store owner – in fact substantially all of our independent us franchise owners started their careers with us as delivery drivers or in other instore

positions thousands of other team members – supervisors trainers quality auditors international business consultants marketers and executives – also began their careers in the stores internal growth and providing opportunities for anyone willing to work hard are the foundation of our core beliefs

the ideals of inspired solutions uncommon honesty and winning together were driving forces behind the relaunch of our brand we were inspired by our harshest critics when it came to the perceived taste of our pizza our solution was not simply more advertising the solution was to create a new recipe and a broader menu of greattasting products our marketing campaign was shockingly honest in its approach telling consumers and showing them via television ads that we heard their negative feedback and were listening and without the buyin

from our franchise owners we couldn’t have done it we believe that we can’t focus solely on the company’s success we must focus on making our stores and our franchisees successful that’s winning together

environmental responsibility 

we believe in launching initiatives to reduce our impact on the environment including the impact of energy waste water land use and reducing waste both in packaging and food since 2015 we have sourced 100 sustainable mass balance palm oil which is used in some of our products we have also recently increased the recycled content of our pizza boxes and launched the use of ebikes for delivery in certain markets around the world helping us to reduce our carbon footprint domino’s is also a member of the dairy sustainability alliance and the recycling partnership

risk factors

tableend 

the quick service restaurant pizza category and the food service and food delivery markets in general are highly competitive and such competition could adversely affect our operating results 

in the us we compete primarily against regional and local companies as well as national chains pizza hut ®

 papa john’s ®

and little caesars pizza ®

 internationally we compete primarily with pizza hut ®

 papa john’s ®

and countryspecific national and local companies we could experience increased competition from existing or new companies in the delivery and carryout

pizza category that could create increasing pressures to grow our business in order to maintain our market share additionally we face growing competition from the supermarket industry and meal kit and food delivery providers with the improvement of prepared food and meal kit offerings expansion in meal delivery platforms and services and the trend towards convergence in grocery deli retail and restaurant services

we also compete on a broader scale with quick service and other international national regional and local restaurants competition from order and delivery aggregators and other food delivery services has also increased in recent years the overall food service market food delivery market and the quick service restaurant market are intensely competitive with respect to food quality price service image convenience and concept and are often affected by changes in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we compete within the food service market and the quick service restaurant market not only for customers but also for management and hourly employees including drivers suitable real estate sites and qualified franchisees our supply chain segment is also subject to competition from outside suppliers while substantially all us franchisees purchased food equipment and supplies from us in 2019 us franchisees are not required to purchase food equipment or supplies from us and they may choose to purchase from outside suppliers if other suppliers who meet our qualification standards were to offer lower prices or better service to our franchisees for their ingredients and supplies and as a result our franchisees chose not to purchase from our us supply chain centers our financial condition business and results of operations would be adversely affected 

if we are unable to maintain our competitive position we could experience downward pressure on prices lower demand for our products reduced margins loss of management or hourly employees disruption in our supply chain centers the inability to take advantage of new business opportunities and the loss of market share all of which would have an adverse effect on our operating results and could cause our stock price to decline 

if we fail to successfully implement our growth strategy which includes opening new us and international stores our ability to increase our revenues and operating profits could be adversely affected 

a significant component of our growth strategy includes the opening of new us both companyowned as well as franchised stores and international franchised stores we and our franchisees face many challenges in opening new stores including among others 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the opening of additional franchise stores also depends in part upon the availability of prospective franchisees who meet our criteria our failure to add a significant number of new stores would adversely affect our ability to increase revenues and operating income additionally our growth strategy and the success of new stores depend in large part on the availability of suitable store sites if we and our franchisees are not able to secure leases in desired locations on favorable terms or to renew such leases our business and results of operations may be adversely affected 

we and our franchisees are currently planning to expand our us and international operations in many of the markets where we currently operate and in select new markets this may require considerable management time as well as startup

expenses for market development before any significant revenues and earnings are generated operations in new foreign markets may achieve low margins or may be unprofitable and expansion in existing markets may be affected by local economic and market conditions therefore as we continue to expand internationally we or our franchisees may not experience the operating margins we expect our results of operations may be negatively impacted and our common stock price may decline in addition we expect to continue our strategy of building additional stores in markets and regions where we have existing stores which may negatively impact sales at existing stores

we may also pursue strategic acquisitions as part of our business if we are able to identify acquisition candidates such acquisitions may be financed to the extent permitted under our debt agreements with substantial debt or with potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities 

the food service market is affected by consumer preferences and perceptions changes in these preferences and perceptions may reduce the demand for our products which would reduce sales and harm our business 

food service businesses are affected by changes in consumer tastes international national regional and local economic conditions marketing advertising pricing including discounting and demographic trends for instance if prevailing health or dietary preferences cause consumers to avoid pizza and other products we offer in favor of foods that are perceived as healthier our business and operating results would be harmed moreover because we are primarily dependent on a single product if consumer demand for pizza should decrease our business would suffer more than if we had a more diversified menu as many other food service businesses do the preferences of customers also may change as a result of advances in technology or alternative delivery methods or channels if we are not able to respond to these changes or our competitors respond to these changes more effectively our business and operating results could be adversely affected 

our inability or failure to recognize respond to and effectively manage the accelerated impact of social media could adversely impact our business 

in recent years there has been a marked increase in the use of social media platforms including blogs chat platforms social media websites and other forms of internetbased communications that allow individuals access to a broad audience of consumers and other persons the rising popularity of social media and other consumeroriented technologies has increased the speed and accessibility of information dissemination and given users the ability to more effectively organize collective actions such as boycotts and other branddamaging behaviors the dissemination of information via social media could harm our business brand reputation marketing partners financial condition and results of operations regardless of the information’s accuracy this could include negative publicity related to our food products or stores or negative publicity related to actions by our executives team members or franchisees 

in addition we frequently use social media to communicate with consumers and the public in general failure to use social media effectively could lead to a decline in brand value and revenue in addition laws and regulations including ftc enforcement rapidly evolve to govern social media platforms and communications a failure of us our employees our franchisees or third parties acting at our direction to abide by applicable laws and regulations in the use of social media could adversely impact our brand reputation marketing partners financial condition and results of operations or subject us or our franchisees to fines or other penaltiesother risks associated with the use of social media include improper disclosure of proprietary information negative comments about our brand exposure of personally identifiable information fraud hoaxes or malicious dissemination of false information 

reports of foodborne illness or food tampering could reduce sales and harm our business 

reports whether true or not of foodborne illnesses such as e coli avian flu bovine spongiform encephalopathy hepatitis a trichinosis or salmonella and injuries caused by food tampering have in the past severely injured the reputations of participants in the quick service restaurant market and could in the future as well the potential for acts of terrorism affecting our global food supply also exists and if such an event occurs it could have a negative impact on us and could severely hurt sales and profits in addition our reputation is an important asset as a result anything that damages our reputation could immediately and severely affect our sales and profits media reports of illnesses and injuries whether accurate or not could force some stores to close or otherwise reduce sales at such stores moreover as described above social media has dramatically increased the rate at which negative publicity including as it relates to foodborne illness can be disseminated before there is any meaningful opportunity to respond to or address an issue even reports of foodborne illnesses or food tampering occurring solely at the restaurants of competitors could by resulting in negative publicity about the restaurant industry in general adversely affect us on a local regional national or international basis further the occurrence of a widespread illness health epidemic or other general health concern could adversely affect us on a local regional or international basis a decrease in global retail sales as a result of these health concerns or negative publicity or as a result of the closure of any domino’s stores could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

we do not have longterm contracts with certain of our suppliers and as a result they could seek to significantly increase prices or fail to deliver 

we do not have longterm contracts or arrangements with certain of our suppliers although in the past we have not experienced significant problems with our suppliers our suppliers may implement significant price increases or may not meet our requirements in a timely fashion or at all the occurrence of any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on the ability of our supply chain centers to deliver necessary products to our stores and on our results of operations 

shortages or interruptions in the supply or delivery of fresh food products could adversely affect our operating results 

we and our franchisees are dependent on frequent deliveries of food products that meet our specifications in addition we have single suppliers or a limited number of suppliers for certain of our ingredients including pizza cheese and meat toppings while we believe there are adequate reserve quantities and potential alternative suppliers shortages or interruptions in the supply of food products caused by increased demand capacity constraints problems in production or distribution financial or other difficulties of suppliers inclement weather or other conditions could adversely affect the availability quality and cost of ingredients additionally the effects of climate change could increase the frequency and duration of weather impacts on our operations and could adversely affect our operating results 

increases in food labor and other costs could adversely affect our profitability and operating results 

an increase in our operating costs could adversely affect our profitability and other operating results factors such as inflation increased food costs increased labor and employee health and benefit costs increased rent costs and increased energy costs may adversely affect our operating costs most of the factors affecting costs are beyond our control and in many cases we may not be able to pass along these increased costs to our customers or franchisees most ingredients used in our pizza particularly cheese are subject to significant price fluctuations as a result of seasonality weather demand and other factors cheese is a significant cost to us representing approximately 25 of the market basket purchased by our companyowned stores additionally while we strive to engage in a competitive bidding process for our ingredients because certain of these ingredients including meat products may only be available from a limited number of vendors we may not always be able to do so effectively furthermore if we need to seek new suppliers we may be subject to pricing or other terms less favorable to us than those reflected in our current supply arrangements labor costs are largely a function of the minimum wage for a majority of our store personnel and certain supply chain center personnel and generally are also a function of the availability of labor several states in which we operate have recently approved minimum wage increases as minimum wage increases are implemented in these states or if such increases are approved and implemented in other states in which we operate we expect our labor costs will continue to increase the advent of legislation aimed at predictive scheduling could impact labor for our stores and our franchisees’ stores additionally while we do not currently have any unionized employees if a significant portion of our employees were to become unionized our labor costs could increase and our business could be negatively affected by other union requirements that increase our costs disrupt our business reduce our flexibility and impact our employee culture labor costs and food costs including cheese generally represent approximately 50 to 60 of the sales at a typical companyowned store 

any prolonged disruption in the operations of any of our dough manufacturing and supply chain centers could harm our business 

we operate 19 regional dough manufacturing and supply chain centers one thin crust manufacturing center and one vegetable processing center in the us and five dough manufacturing and supply chain centers in canada we plan to continue investing in additional supply chain capacity in the future 

our us dough manufacturing and supply chain centers service all of our companyowned and us franchise stores as a result any prolonged disruption in the operations of any of these facilities whether due to technical or labor difficulties destruction or damage to the facility real estate issues limited capacity or other reasons could adversely affect our business and operating results 

our success depends in part upon effective advertising and lower advertising funds may reduce our ability to adequately market the domino’s pizza brand 

we have been routinely named a leading national advertiser by advertising age

 each domino’s store located in the contiguous us is obligated to contribute 6 of its sales subject in certain instances to lower rates based on certain incentives and waivers to dnaf which uses such fees for national advertising in addition to contributions for local marketlevel advertising we currently anticipate that this 6 contribution rate will remain in place for the foreseeable future while additional funds for advertising in the past have been provided by us our franchisees and other third parties none of these additional funds are legally required the lack of continued financial support for advertising activities could significantly curtail our marketing efforts which may in turn materially and adversely affect our business and our operating results

we face risks of litigation investigations enforcement actions and negative publicity from customers franchisees suppliers employees regulators and others in the ordinary course of business which can or could divert our financial and management resources litigation investigations enforcement actions or publicity may adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations 

claims of illness or injury relating to food quality or food handling are common in the food service industry and vehicular accidents and injuries occur in the food delivery business we are currently subject to these types of claims and have been subject to these types of claims in the past claims within our industry of improper supplier actions also occasionally arise that if made against one of our suppliers could potentially damage our brand image in addition class action lawsuits have been filed and may continue to be filed against various quick service restaurants alleging among other things that quick service restaurants have failed to disclose the health risks associated with highfat

foods and that quick service restaurant marketing practices have encouraged obesity state attorney general offices or other regulators have initiated and may in the future initiate investigations or enforcement actions against us in addition to decreasing our sales and profitability and diverting our management resources adverse publicity resulting from such allegations may materially and adversely affect us and our brand regardless of whether such allegations are valid or whether we are liable further a substantial settlement fine penalty or judgment against us could negatively impact our financial condition results of operations and brand reputation thereby hindering our ability to attract and retain franchisees and grow our business

further we may be subject to employee franchisee and other claims in the future based on among other things discrimination harassment wrongful termination and wage rest break and meal break issues including claims relating to overtime compensation we have been and continue to be subject to these types of claims if one or more of these claims were to be successful or if there is a significant increase in the number of these claims or if we receive significant negative publicity our business financial condition and operating results could be harmed 

loss of key employees or our inability to attract and retain new qualified employees could hurt our business and inhibit our ability to operate and grow successfully 

our success in the highly competitive pizza delivery and carryout

business will continue to depend to a significant extent on our leadership team and other key management personnel although we have entered into employment agreements with richard e allison jr and russell j weiner each of these executives may terminate his agreement on ninety days’ notice our other executive officers may terminate their employment pursuant to their employment agreements at any time as a result we may not be able to retain our executive officers and key personnel or attract additional qualified management while we do not have longterm employment agreements with our executive officers for all of our executive officers we have noncompete

and nonsolicitation 

agreements that extend for 24 months following the termination of such executive officer’s employment our success will also continue to depend on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel to operate our stores dough manufacturing and supply chain centers and international operations the loss of these employees or our inability to recruit and retain qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our operating results

adverse global economic conditions subject us to additional risk 

our financial condition and results of operations are impacted by global markets and economic conditions over which neither we nor our franchisees have control an economic downturn including deterioration in the economic conditions in the us or international markets where we compete may result in a reduction in the demand for our products longer payment cycles slower adoption of new technologies and increased price competition 

poor economic conditions may adversely affect the ability of our franchisees to pay royalties or amounts owed and could have a material adverse impact on our ability to pursue our growth strategy which would reduce cash collections and in turn may materially and adversely affect our ability to service our debt obligations 

our international operations subject us to additional risk such risks and costs may differ in each country in which we and our franchisees do business and may cause our profitability to decline due to increased costs 

we conduct a significant and growing portion of our business outside the us our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected if global markets in which our franchise stores compete are affected by changes in political economic or other factors these factors over which neither we nor our franchisees have control may include 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fluctuations in the value of the us dollar in relation to other currencies may lead to lower revenues and earnings 

exchange rate fluctuations could have an adverse effect on our results of operations international franchise royalties and fees represented approximately 67 of our total revenues in 2019 65 of our total revenues in 2018 and 74 of our total revenues in 2017 a majority of which were denominated in foreign currencies we also operate dough manufacturing and distribution facilities in canada which generate revenues denominated in canadian dollars sales made by franchise stores outside the us are denominated in the currency of the country in which the store is located and this currency could become less valuable in us dollars as a result of exchange rate fluctuations unfavorable currency fluctuations could lead to increased prices to customers outside the us or lower profitability to our franchisees outside the us or could result in lower revenues for us on a us dollar basis from such customers and franchisees a hypothetical 10 adverse change in the foreign currency rates in our international markets would have resulted in a negative impact on international royalty revenues of approximately 212 million in 2019 

our earnings and business growth strategy depend on the success of our franchisees and we may be harmed by actions taken by our franchisees or employees of our franchisees that are outside of our control 

a significant portion of our earnings comes from royalties and fees generated by our franchise stores franchisees are independent operators and their employees are not our employees we provide tools for franchisees to use in training their employees but the quality of franchise store operations and our brand and branded products may be diminished by any number of factors beyond our control consequently franchisees may not operate stores in a manner consistent with our standards and requirements or they or their employees may take other actions that adversely affect the value of our brand in such event our business and reputation may suffer and as a result our revenues and stock price could decline 

while we try to ensure that franchisees maintain the quality of the domino’s brand and branded products and comply with their franchise agreements franchisees may take actions that adversely affect the value of our intellectual property or reputation or that are inconsistent with their contractual obligations although our franchise arrangements permit the applicable franchisor to terminate a franchise agreement under certain circumstances including the failure by franchisees to uphold quality standards there can be no assurance that such remedy will be available or sufficient to prevent harm to our brand and protect our intellectual property 

as of december 29 2019 we had 777 us franchisees operating 5784 us stores twenty of these franchisees each own and operate more than 50 us stores including our largest us franchisee who owns and operates 176 stores and the average franchisee owns and operates approximately seven stores 

our international master franchisees are generally responsible for the development of significantly more stores than our us franchisees as a result our international operations are more closely tied to the success of a smaller number of franchisees than our us operations as of december 29 2019 our largest international master franchisee operated 2604 stores in nine markets which accounts for approximately 24 of our total international store count our us and international franchisees may not operate their franchises successfully if one or more of our key franchisees were to become insolvent or otherwise were unable or unwilling to pay us our royalties or other amounts owed our business and results of operations would be adversely affected 

we may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property which could harm the value of our brand and branded products and adversely affect our business 

we depend in large part on our brand and branded products and believe that they are very important to our business we rely on a combination of trademarks copyrights trade secrets and similar intellectual property rights to protect our brand and branded products the success of our business depends on our continued ability to use our existing trademarks in order to capitalize on our name recognition increase brand awareness and further develop our branded products in both us and international markets we have registered certain trademarks and have other trademark applications pending in the us and foreign jurisdictions not all of the trademarks that we currently use have been registered in all of the countries in which we do business and they may never be registered in all of these countries some countries’ laws do not protect unregistered trademarks at all or make them more difficult to enforce and third parties may have filed for “domino’s” or similar marks in countries where domino’s has not registered its brand accordingly we may not be able to adequately protect our trademarks everywhere in the world and our use of these trademarks may result in liability for trademark infringement trademark dilution or unfair competition 

all of the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property in the us and in foreign countries may not be adequate in addition the laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the us further through acquisitions of third parties or assets we may acquire brands and related trademarks that are subject to the same risks as the brands and trademarks we currently own 

we may from time to time be required to institute or defend litigation to enforce our trademarks or other intellectual property rights or to protect our trade secrets such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could negatively affect our sales profitability and prospects regardless of whether we are able to successfully enforce our rights 

the occurrence of cyber incidents or a deficiency in cybersecurity could negatively impact our business by causing a disruption to our operations a compromise or corruption of confidential information or damage to our employee and business relationships any of which could subject us to loss and harm our brand 

a cyber incident is considered to be any adverse event that threatens the confidentiality integrity or availability of information resources more specifically a cyber incident is an intentional attack or an unintentional event that can include gaining unauthorized access to systems to disrupt operations corrupt data or steal confidential information about customers franchisees suppliers or employees a number of retailers and other companies have recently experienced serious cyber incidents and breaches of their information technology systems as our reliance on technology has increased so have the risks posed to our systems both internal and those we have outsourced the three primary risks that could directly result from the occurrence of a cyber incident include operational interruption damage to our relationships with customers franchisees and employees and private data exposure including payment card or other financial data in addition to maintaining insurance coverage to address cyber incidents we have also implemented processes procedures and controls to help mitigate these risks however our cyber insurance coverage may not fully cover all of the costs associated with a cyber incident and these measures as well as our increased awareness of the risk of a cyber incident do not guarantee that our reputation and financial results will not be materially and adversely affected by such an incident 

our and our franchisees’ operations depend upon our ability and the ability of franchisees and thirdparty service providers as well as franchisees’ thirdparty service providers to protect computer equipment and systems against damage from theft fire power loss telecommunications failure and other catastrophic or unanticipated events as well as internal and external security incidents viruses denialofservice

attacks phishing attacks ransomware attacks and other intentional or unintentional disruptions a significant portion of our retail sales depend on the continuing operation of our information technology and communications systems including but not limited to domino’s pulse ™

 our online and mobile ordering platforms and our credit card processing systems the failure of these systems to operate effectively stemming from maintenance problems upgrading or transitioning to new platforms a compromise in our security or other unanticipated problems could result in interruptions to or delays in our and our franchisees’ operations some of our systems are not fully redundant and our system’s disaster recovery planning cannot account for all eventualities the occurrence of a natural disaster intentional sabotage or other unanticipated problems could result in lengthy interruptions in service in addition the implementation of technology changes and upgrades to maintain and upgrade our systems errors or vulnerabilities in our systems or damage to or failure of our systems could result in interruptions in our services and noncompliance

with certain laws or regulations which could reduce our sales revenues and profits and damage our business and brand

because we and our franchisees accept electronic forms of payment from customers our business requires the collection and retention of customer data including sensitive financial data and other personally identifiable information in various information systems that we and our franchisees maintain and in those maintained by third parties with whom we and our franchisees contract to provide payment processing a weakness in such third party’s systems or software products may provide a mechanism for a cyber threat in recent years a significant number of companies have experienced security data breaches in which customer information was stolen through vendor access channels while we select our thirdparty suppliers carefully cyberattacks and security data breaches at a payment processing contractor could compromise confidential information or adversely affect our ability to deliver products and services to our customers these problems could negatively affect our results of operations and remediation could result in significant unplanned capital investments 

we also maintain important internal company data such as personally identifiable information about our employees and franchisees and information relating to our operations in addition more than half of all global retail sales in 2019 were derived from digital channels primarily through our online ordering website and mobile applications where customers enter personally identifiable information that we retain our use and retention of personally identifiable information is regulated by foreign federal and state laws and regulations as well as by certain thirdparty agreements for example the european union adopted a new regulation that became effective in may 2018 the european union general data protection regulation and the state of california adopted the california consumer privacy act that became effective on january 1 2020 both of which require companies to meet new requirements regarding the handling of personal data as privacy and information security laws and regulations change we may incur additional costs to ensure that we remain in compliance with those laws and regulations if our security and information systems are compromised or if we our employees or franchisees fail to comply with these laws regulations or contract terms or to successfully implement appropriate processes related to applicable requirements laws and regulations governing cyber incidents could require us to notify customers employees or other groups and could result in adverse publicity loss of sales and cash flows increased fees payable to third parties and fines penalties or remediation and other costs that could adversely affect our reputation business and results of operations any other material disruption or other adverse event affecting one or more of our digital ordering platforms including for instance power loss technological failures user error or cyberattacks could similarly result in adverse publicity loss of sales and cash flows and other costs which could in turn materially and adversely affect our reputation business and results of operations 

we cannot predict the impact that new or improved technologies alternative methods of delivery including autonomous vehicle delivery or changes in consumer behavior facilitated by these technologies and alternative methods of delivery will have on our business 

advances in technologies or alternative methods of delivery including advances in digital ordering technology or certain changes in consumer behavior driven by these or other technologies and methods of delivery could have a negative effect on our business and market position moreover technology and consumer offerings continue to develop and we expect that new or enhanced technologies and consumer offerings will be available in the future we may pursue certain of those technologies and consumer offerings if we believe they offer a sustainable customer proposition and can be successfully integrated into our business model however we cannot predict consumer acceptance of these delivery channels or their impact on our business in addition our competitors some of whom have greater resources financial or otherwise than we do may be able to benefit from changes in technologies or consumer acceptance of alternative methods of delivery which could harm our competitive position there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully respond to changing consumer preferences including with respect to new technologies and alternative methods of delivery or to effectively adjust our product mix service offerings and marketing and merchandising initiatives for products and services that address and anticipate advances in technology and market trends if we are not able to successfully respond to these challenges our business market share financial condition and operating results could be materially and adversely affected 

we are subject to a number of risks related to credit card and debit card payments we accept 

as store operators we and our franchisees accept payments through credit card and debit card transactions for credit card and debit card payments we and our franchisees pay interchange and other fees which may increase over time an increase in such fees would cause an increase in our operating expenses and those of our franchisees and could require an increase in the prices charged for our products either of which could harm our operating results if there are malfunctions or other problems with our or our franchisees’ processing vendors billing software or payment processing systems our or our franchisees’ customer satisfaction may be adversely affected and one or more of the major payment networks could disallow us or our franchisees’ continued use of their payment methods if we or our franchisees fail to adequately control fraudulent credit card and debit card transactions or to comply with the payment card industry data security standards we or our franchisees may face civil liability diminished public perception of our or their security measures fines and assessments from the card brands and significantly higher credit card and debit card related costs each of which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations the termination of our ability to process payments through any major payment network would significantly impair our ability to operate our business we and our franchisees may need to expand or change our or their information systems to support different or emerging forms of payment methods including as a result of consumer demand or contractual or legal or regulatory requirements which may be timeconsuming and expensive and we or they may not realize a return on the investment 

we and our franchisees are subject to extensive government regulation and requirements issued by other groups and our failure to comply with existing or increased regulations could adversely affect our business and operating results 

we are subject to numerous federal state local and foreign laws and regulations as well as requirements issued by other groups including those relating to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we are subject to an ftc rule and to various state and foreign laws that govern the offer and sale of franchises these laws regulate various aspects of the franchise relationship including terminations and the refusal to renew franchises the failure to comply with these laws and regulations in any jurisdiction or to obtain required government approvals could result in a ban or temporary suspension on future franchise sales fines or other penalties or require us to make offers of rescission or restitution any of which could adversely affect our business and operating results 

in august 2015 the national labor relations board adopted a new and broader standard for determining when two or more otherwise unrelated employers may be found to be a joint employer of the same employees under the national labor relations act while the national labor relations board has formally proposed a rule that would reinstate the standard that was in place before august 2015 and invited public comment a final rule has not yet been issued in december 2019 the national labor relations board directed an administrative law judge to approve settlement agreements rather than rejecting the settlement and allowing the claims asserting that the franchisor should be the joint employer of its franchisees’ employees to proceed in a decision related to another franchise system however this decision is subject to appeal if the august 2015 standard remains in place or is adopted by other government agencies andor applied generally to franchise relationships it could cause us to be liable or held responsible for unfair labor practices and other violations of our franchisees and subject us to other liabilities and require us to conduct collective bargaining negotiations regarding employees of totally separate independent employers most notably our franchisees in such event our operating expenses may increase as a result of required modifications to our business practices increased litigation governmental investigations or proceedings administrative enforcement actions fines and civil liability additionally depending upon legal developments in california franchisors may be subject to claims that their franchisees should be treated as employees and not as independent contractors in california and potentially certain other states and localities with similar employment laws if such misclassification claims are successful against a franchisor the franchisor could be liable to its franchisees and potentially their employees and thereafter have to treat its franchisees and their employees as the franchisor’s employees under these laws 

we and our franchisees are subject to the fair labor standards act of 1938 as amended the “fair labor standards act” which along with the family and medical leave act governs such matters as minimum wage and overtime requirements and other working conditions and various family leave mandates as well as a variety of other laws enacted or rules and regulations promulgated by federal state and local governmental authorities that govern these and other employment matters we and our franchisees have experienced and expect further increases in payroll expenses as a result of governmentmandated increases in the minimum wage and although such increases are not currently expected to be material there may be material increases in the future enactment and enforcement of various federal state and local laws rules and regulations on immigration and labor organizations may adversely impact the availability and costs of labor for domino’s and franchisees’ stores in a particular area or across the united states in addition thirdparty suppliers may be affected by higher minimum wage standards which may increase the price of goods and services they supply to us such increased expenses may cause our franchisees to exit the business or cause us to reduce the number of companyowned stores or otherwise adversely affect the amount of royalty payments and license fees we receive 

on january 12 2020 the us department of labor announced a final rule to update and clarify the definition of joint employer under the fair labor standards act under the final rule the general test for assessing whether a party can be deemed a joint employer would be based upon whether that party i hires or fires the employee ii supervises and controls the employee’s work schedule or conditions of employment iii determines the employee’s rate and method of payment and iv maintains the employee’s employment records in the final rule the department of labor describes instances in which joint employment would not be more or less likely to be found to exist under the fair labor standards act which according to the department of labor includes the relationships that exist under the typical franchise business model this rule may reduce a franchisor’s risk of liability that currently exists under the joint employer standard now in effect under the fair labor standards act though ultimately the facts specific to the franchisorfranchisee model at issue would be considered when determining liability however the rule is separate from the joint employer standard under the national labor relations act the rulemaking currently underway at the national labor relations board and as described above potential liability as a joint employer under the national labor relations act 

certain governmental authorities and private litigants have recently asserted claims against franchisors including us for provisions in our prior franchise agreements that restrict franchisees from soliciting or hiring the employees of other franchisees or the applicable franchisor claims against franchisors for such clauses include allegations that these clauses violate state and federal antitrust and unfair practices laws by restricting the free movement of employees of franchisees andor franchisor including the employees of companyowned stores thereby depressing the wages of those employees 

the patient protection and affordable care act as amended the “affordable care act” requires employers such as us to provide health insurance for all qualifying employees or pay penalties for not providing coverage the majority of the increases in these costs began in 2015 and while the incremental costs of this program have not been material to us to date we cannot predict what effect these costs will have on our results of operations and financial position or the effects of the affordable care act on some of our larger franchisees modifications to or repeal of all or certain provisions of the affordable care act are possible consistent with statements made by certain elected officials 

the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 the “2017 tax act” was signed into law on december 22 2017 significantly reforming the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the 2017 tax act among other things changed us federal corporate income tax rates imposed significant additional limitations on the deductibility of interest allowed for the expensing of capital expenditures put into effect the migration from a “worldwide” system of taxation to a territorial system and modified or repealed many business deductions and credits rulings and regulations continue to be issued related to the 2017 tax act and we continue to examine the impact these updates to the 2017 tax act may have on our business the estimated impact of the 2017 tax act is based on our management’s current knowledge and assumptions and recognized impacts could be materially different from current estimates based on our actual results and our further analysis of the law 

we revalued our net deferred tax assets and liabilities at the newly enacted corporate tax rate in fiscal 2017 and recorded a significantly lower effective tax rate in 2019 and 2018 we currently expect the lower effective tax rates for the company recognized in 2019 and 2018 will continue in future periods 

among other provisions the 2017 tax act effective for taxable years beginning on january 1 2018 amended section 163j of the code to impose significant additional limitations on the deductibility of business interest expense while we do not currently expect the interest limitation under section 163j to materially limit our ability to deduct business interest the finalization of the current proposed treasury regulations and other future guidance could change this and materially limit our ability to deduct business interest in the future 

there also has been increased public focus including by us and foreign governmental authorities on environmental sustainability matters such as climate change the reduction of greenhouse gases and water consumption legislative regulatory or other efforts to combat climate change or other environmental concerns could result in future increases in taxes restrictions on or increases in the costs of supplies transportation and utilities any of which could increase our operating costs and those of our franchisees and necessitate future investments in facilities and equipment these risks also include the increased pressure to make commitments set targets or establish additional goals to take actions to meet them which could expose us and our franchisees to market operational execution and reputational costs or risks 

we may also become subject to legislation or regulation seeking to tax andor regulate highfat

foods foods with high sugar and salt content or foods otherwise deemed to be “unhealthy” and our capital expenditures could increase due to remediation and compliance measures related to these laws or regulations

adverse government regulations and enforcement efforts including the examples mentioned above or noncompliance

by us or our franchisees with any of the foregoing laws and regulations could lead to various claims or governmental or judicial fines sanctions or other enforcement measures which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

our current insurance coverage may not be adequate insurance premiums for such coverage may increase and we may not be able to obtain insurance at acceptable rates or at all 

we have retention programs for workers’ compensation general liability and owned and nonowned

automobile liabilities we are generally responsible for up to 10 million per occurrence under these retention programs for workers’ compensation and general liability we are generally responsible for up to 30 million per occurrence under these retention programs for owned and nonowned 

automobile liabilities total insurance limits under these retention programs vary depending upon the period covered and range up to 1100 million per occurrence for general liability and owned and nonowned

automobile liabilities and up to the applicable statutory limits for workers’ compensation these insurance policies may not be adequate to protect us from liabilities that we incur in our business in addition in the future our insurance premiums may increase and we may not be able to obtain similar levels of insurance on reasonable terms or at all any such inadequacy of or inability to obtain insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

our annual and quarterly financial results are subject to significant fluctuations depending on various factors many of which are beyond our control and if we fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors our share price may decline significantly 

our sales and operating results can vary significantly from quartertoquarter

and yeartoyear

depending on various factors many of which are beyond our control these factors include among other things

 

 

 

 

 

 

as a result our operational performance may decline quickly and significantly in response to changes in order patterns or rapid decreases in demand for our products any such decline may cause us and our franchisees to experience lower sales revenue we anticipate that fluctuations in operating results will continue in the future 

our common stock price could be subject to significant fluctuations andor may decline 

the market price of our common stock could be subject to significant fluctuations among the factors that could affect our stock price are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the stock markets in general have experienced volatility that has sometimes been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies these broad market fluctuations may cause the trading price of our common stock to decline 

actions of activist investors could negatively impact our business and the value of our stock price 

publiclytraded companies have increasingly become subject to activist investor campaigns responding to actions of an activist investor may be a significant distraction for our management and staff and could require us to expend significant time and resources including legal fees and potential proxy solicitation expenses any of these conditions could materially adversely affect our financial performance 

our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our business and limit our ability to plan for or respond to changes in our business 

we have a substantial amount of indebtedness as of december 29 2019 our consolidated total indebtedness was approximately 411 billion we may also incur additional debt which would not be prohibited under the terms of our current securitized debt agreements our substantial indebtedness could have important consequences for our business and our shareholders for example it could 

 

 

 

 

further a portion of our indebtedness bears interest at fluctuating interest rates based on the london interbank offered rate “libor” and there is currently uncertainty around whether libor will continue to exist after 2021 if libor ceases to exist we may need to renegotiate certain loan documents and we cannot predict what alternative index would be negotiated with our lenders as a result our interest expense could increase in which event we may have difficulties making interest payments and funding our other fixed costs and our available cash flow for general corporate requirements may be adversely affected 

in addition the financial and other covenants we agreed to with our lenders may limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness make investments pay dividends and engage in other transactions and the leverage may cause potential lenders to be less willing to loan funds to us in the future our failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default that if not cured or waived could result in the acceleration of repayment of all of our indebtedness 

downgrades in our credit ratings could impact our ability to access capital and materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

our debt is rated by credit rating agencies these agencies may downgrade their credit ratings for us based on the performance of our business our capital strategies or their overall view of our industry there can be no assurance that any rating assigned to our currently outstanding indebtedness will remain in effect for any given period of time or that any such ratings will not be lowered suspended or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if in that agency’s judgment circumstances so warrant a downgrade of our credit ratings could among other things increase our cost of borrowing limit our ability to access capital result in more restrictive covenants in agreements governing the terms of any future indebtedness that we may incur including restrictions on our ability to pay dividends or repurchase shares or require us to provide collateral for future borrowings and thereby adversely impact our business financial condition and results of operations 

we may be unable to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our significant debt service obligations which would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

our ability to make principal and interest payments on and to refinance our indebtedness will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future this to a certain extent is subject to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control if our business does not generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the amounts projected or at all or if future borrowings are not available to us under our variable funding notes in amounts sufficient to fund our other liquidity needs our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected if we cannot generate sufficient cash flow from operations to make scheduled principal amortization and interest payments on our debt obligations in the future we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity sell assets delay capital expenditures or seek additional equity if we are unable to refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all or to affect any other action relating to our indebtedness on satisfactory terms or at all our business may be harmed 

the terms of our securitized debt financing of certain of our whollyowned subsidiaries have restrictive terms and our failure to comply with any of these terms could put us in default which would have an adverse effect on our business and prospects 

unless and until we repay all outstanding borrowings under our securitized debt we will remain subject to the restrictive terms of these borrowings the securitized debt under which certain of our whollyowned subsidiaries issued and guaranteed fixed rate notes and variable funding senior revolving notes contain a number of covenants with the most significant financial covenant being a debt service coverage calculation these covenants limit the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to among other things 

  

 

 

  

 

 

  

 

 

  

 

 

  

 

 

  

 

 

  

 

 

  

 

 

the securitized debt also requires us to maintain specified financial ratios at the end of each fiscal quarter these restrictions could affect our ability to pay dividends or repurchase shares of our common stock our ability to meet these financial ratios can be affected by events beyond our control and we may not satisfy such a test a breach of this covenant could result in a rapid amortization event or default under the securitized debt if amounts owed under the securitized debt are accelerated because of a default under the securitized debt and we are unable to pay such amounts the investors may have the right to assume control of substantially all of the securitized assets 

during the term following issuance the outstanding senior notes will accrue interest in accordance with the terms of the debt agreements additionally our senior notes have original scheduled principal payments of 420 million in each of 2020 and 2021 8970 million in 2022 330 million in each of 2023 and 2024 115 billion in 2025 208 million in 2026 128 billion in 2027 68 million in 2028 and 6143 million in 2029 in accordance with our debt agreements the payment of principal on the outstanding senior notes shall be suspended if the leverage ratios for the company are less than or equal to 50x total debt as defined to adjusted ebitda as defined in the indenture governing our securitized debt and no catchup

provisions are applicable

if we are unable to refinance or repay amounts under the securitized debt prior to the expiration of the term our cash flow would be directed to the repayment of the securitized debt and other than a weekly management fee sufficient to cover minimal selling general and administrative expenses would not be available for operating our business 

no assurance can be given that any refinancing or additional financing will be possible when needed or that we will be able to negotiate acceptable terms in addition our access to capital is affected by prevailing conditions in the financial and capital markets and other factors beyond our control there can be no assurance that market conditions will be favorable at the times that we require new or additional financing 

the indenture governing the securitized debt will restrict the cash flow from the entities subject to the securitization to any of our other entities and upon the occurrence of certain events cash flow would be further restricted 

in the event that a rapid amortization event occurs under the indenture including without limitation upon an event of default under the indenture or the failure to repay the securitized debt at the end of its term the funds available to us would be reduced or eliminated which would in turn reduce our ability to operate or grow our business 

we are subject to a variety of additional risks associated with our franchisees 

our franchise system subjects us to a number of additional risks any one of which may impact our ability to collect royalty payments and fees from our franchisees may harm the goodwill associated with our brand andor may materially and adversely impact our business and results of operations such risks may also apply to us as owners of stores these risks include but are not limited to

we are a party to lawsuits revenue agent reviews by taxing authorities and administrative proceedings in the ordinary course of business which include without limitation workers’ compensation general liability automobile and franchisee claims we are also subject to suits related to employment practices 

litigation is subject to many uncertainties and the outcome of individual litigated matters is not predictable with assurance these matters referenced above could be decided unfavorably to us and could require us to pay damages or make other expenditures in amounts or a range of amounts that cannot be estimated with accuracy in management’s opinion these matters individually and in the aggregate should not have a significant adverse effect on the financial condition of the company and the established accruals adequately provide for the estimated resolution of such claims 

on february 14 2011 domino’s pizza llc was named as a defendant in a lawsuit along with fischler enterprises of cf inc a franchisee and jeffrey s kidd the franchisee’s delivery driver filed by yvonne wiederhold the plaintiff as personal representative of the estate of richard e wiederhold deceased the case involved a traffic accident in which the franchisee’s delivery driver is alleged to have caused an accident involving a vehicle driven by richard wiederhold mr wiederhold sustained spinal injuries resulting in quadriplegia and passed away several months after the accident the case went to trial in 2016 and the company was found liable but the verdict was reversed by the florida fifth district court of appeals in may 2018 and was remanded to the ninth judicial circuit court of florida for a new trial the case was tried again in june 2019 and the jury returned a 90 million judgment for the plaintiff where the company and mr kidd were found to be 100 liable after certain offsets and other deductions the final verdict was 80 million the company continues to deny liability and has filed an appeal

description of the business 

domino’s is the largest pizza company in the world based on global retail sales with more than 17000 locations in over 90 markets around the world founded in 1960 our roots are in convenient pizza delivery while a significant amount of our sales also come from carryout customers although we are a highlyrecognized global brand we focus on serving neighborhoods locally through our large network of franchise owners and companyowned stores 

our business model is straightforward domino’s stores handcraft and serve quality food at a competitive price with easy ordering access and efficient service enhanced by our technological innovations our handtossed dough is made fresh and distributed to stores around the world by us and our franchisees 

domino’s generates revenues and earnings by charging royalties and fees to our franchisees royalties are ongoing percentofsales 

fees for use of the domino’s brand marks we also generate revenues and earnings by selling food equipment and supplies to franchisees primarily in the us and canada and by operating a number of our own stores franchisees profit by selling pizza and other complementary items to their local customers in our international markets we generally grant geographical rights to the domino’s pizza brand to master franchisees these master franchisees are charged with developing their geographical area and they may profit by subfranchising

and selling food and equipment to those subfranchisees

as well as by running pizza stores everyone in the system can benefit including the end consumer who can purchase domino’s menu items for themselves and their family conveniently and economically

our business model can yield strong returns for our franchise owners and companyowned stores it can also yield significant cash flow to us through a consistent franchise royalty payment and supply chain revenue stream with moderate capital expenditures we have historically returned cash to shareholders through dividend payments and share repurchases since becoming a publiclytraded company in 2004 

fiscal 2019 highlights 

  

 

  

 

  

 

  

 

  

 

  

 

during 2019 we continued our rapid global expansion with the opening of 1106 net new stores our international franchise segment led the way with 856 net new store openings we also continued our strong us and international same store sales performance with 35 straight quarters of positive us same store sales and 104 straight quarters of positive international same store sales our us carryout business experienced continued strong growth while our overall us delivery business continues to grow our us delivery same store sales growth has been pressured by our fortressing strategy which includes increasing store concentration in certain markets where we compete as well as from aggressive competitive activity 

we remained focused on improving the customer experience through our technology initiatives including the recent launch of our gps delivery tracking technology which allows customers to track the progress of their pizza delivery through the domino’s ordering platforms our emphasis on technology innovation helped the domino’s system generate more than half of global retail sales from digital channels in 2019 overall we believe our focus in 2019 on global growth and technology will continue to strengthen our brand in the future 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of these financial statements requires our management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis our management evaluates its estimates including those related to revenue recognition longlived assets insurance and legal matters sharebased payments and income taxes we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from those estimates changes in our accounting policies and estimates could materially impact our results of operations and financial condition for any particular period we believe that our most critical accounting policies and estimates are 

revenue recognition

 we earn revenues through our network of us companyowned and franchised stores dough manufacturing and supply chain centers and international operations retail sales from franchise stores are reported to us by our franchisees and are not included in our revenues retail sales from companyowned stores and royalty revenues resulting from the retail sales from franchised stores are recognized as revenues when the items are delivered to or carried out by customers retail sales are generally reported and related royalties paid to us based on a percentage of retail sales as specified in the related standard franchise agreement generally 55 of us franchise retail sales and on average 30 of international franchise retail sales we also generate revenues from us franchise advertising contributions to dnaf our consolidated notforprofit

advertising fund generally 60 of us franchise retail sales although these revenues are restricted to be used only for advertising and promotional activities to benefit franchised stores we have determined there are not performance obligations associated with the franchise advertising contributions received by dnaf that are separate from our us royalty payment stream and as a result these franchise contributions and the related expenses are presented gross in the consolidated statements of income revenues from companyowned stores and revenues from franchised stores including us franchise royalties and fees and us franchise advertising revenues can fluctuate from timetotime

as a result of store count and sales level changes sales of food from our supply chain centers are recognized as revenues upon delivery of the food to franchisees while sales of equipment and supplies are generally recognized as revenues upon shipment of the related products to franchisees

longlived assets

we record longlived assets including property plant and equipment and capitalized software at cost for acquisitions of franchise operations we estimate the fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired based on physical inspection of assets historical experience and other information available to us regarding the acquisition we depreciate and amortize longlived assets using useful lives determined by us based on historical experience and other information available to us we evaluate the potential impairment of longlived assets at least annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable our evaluation is based on various analyses including the projection of undiscounted cash flows for companyowned stores we perform related impairment tests on an operating market basis which we have determined to be the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of other cash flows if the carrying amount of a longlived asset exceeds the amount of the expected future undiscounted cash flows of that asset we estimate the fair value of the asset if the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset an impairment loss is recognized and the asset is written down to its estimated fair value

we have not made any significant changes in the methodology used to project the future market cash flows of companyowned stores during the years presented same store sales fluctuations and the rates at which operating costs will fluctuate in the future are key factors in evaluating recoverability of the related assets if our same store sales significantly decline or if operating costs increase and we are unable to recover these costs the carrying value of our companyowned stores by market may be unrecoverable and we may be required to recognize an impairment charge 

insurance and legal matters

we are a party to lawsuits and legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business management closely monitors these legal matters and estimates the probable costs for the resolution of such matters these estimates are primarily determined by consulting with both internal and external parties handling the matters and are based upon an analysis of potential results assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies legal judgments can be volatile and difficult to predict accordingly if our estimates relating to legal matters proved inaccurate for any reason we may be required to increase or decrease the related expense in future periods we had accruals for legal matters of approximately 18 million at december 29 2019 and 19 million at december 30 2018

for certain periods prior to december 1998 and for periods after december 2001 we maintain insurance coverage for workers’ compensation general liability and owned and nonowned

auto liability under insurance policies requiring payment of a deductible for each occurrence up to between 500000 and 30 million depending on the policy year and line of coverage the related insurance reserves are based on undiscounted independent actuarial estimates which are based on historical information along with assumptions about future events analyses of historical trends and actuarial valuation methods are utilized to estimate the ultimate claim costs for claims incurred as of the balance sheet date and for claims incurred but not yet reported when estimating these liabilities several factors are considered including the severity duration and frequency of claims legal cost associated with claims healthcare trends and projected inflation

our methodology for determining our exposure has remained consistent throughout the years presented management believes that the various assumptions developed and actuarial methods used to determine our insurance reserves are reasonable and provide meaningful data that management uses to make its best estimate of our exposure to these risks changes in assumptions for such factors as medical costs and legal actions as well as changes in actual experience could cause our estimates to change in the near term which could result in an increase or decrease in the related expense in future periods a 10 change in our insurance liability at december 29 2019 would have affected our income before provision for income taxes by approximately 58 million in 2019 we had accruals for insurance matters of approximately 584 million at december 29 2019 and 533 million at december 30 2018 

sharebased payments

we recognize compensation expense related to our sharebased compensation arrangements over the requisite service period based on the grant date fair value of the awards the grant date fair value of each restricted stock and performancebased restricted stock award is equal to the market price of our stock on the date of grant the grant date fair value of each stock option award is estimated using the blackscholes option pricing model the pricing model requires assumptions including the expected life of the stock option the riskfree interest rate the expected dividend yield and expected volatility of our stock over the expected life which significantly impact the assumed fair value we account for forfeitures as they occur additionally our stock option restricted stock and performancebased restricted stock arrangements provide for accelerated vesting and the ability to exercise during the remainder of the tenyear

stock option life upon the retirement of individuals holding the awards who have achieved specified service and age requirements

management believes that the methods and various assumptions used to determine compensation expense related to these arrangements are reasonable but if the assumptions change significantly for future grants sharebased compensation expense will fluctuate in future years 

income taxes

we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities we measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using current enacted tax rates that will apply in the years in which we expect the temporary differences to be recovered or paid judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes related reserves and deferred tax assets and liabilities these include establishing a valuation allowance related to the ability to realize certain deferred tax assets if necessary on an ongoing basis management will assess whether it remains more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets will be realized our accounting for deferred tax assets represents our best estimate of future events our net deferred tax assets assume that we will generate sufficient taxable income in specific tax jurisdictions based on our estimates and assumptions changes in our current estimates due to unanticipated events could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations

tabular amounts in millions except percentages 

revenues 

revenues primarily consist of retail sales from our companyowned stores royalties advertising contributions and fees from our us franchised stores royalties and fees from our international franchised stores and sales of food equipment and supplies from our supply chain centers to substantially all of our us franchised stores and certain international franchised stores companyowned store and franchised store revenues may vary from period to period due to changes in store count mix supply chain revenues may vary significantly as a result of fluctuations in commodity prices as well as the mix of products we sell

consolidated revenues increased 1859 million or 54 in 2019 due primarily to higher supply chain food volumes as well as higher global franchise revenues resulting from retail sales growth these increases in revenues were partially offset by lower us companyowned store revenues resulting from the sale of 59 companyowned stores to certain of our existing us franchisees during the second quarter of 2019 the “2019 store sale” these changes in revenues are more fully described below 

us stores

revenues from us stores are primarily comprised of retail sales from us companyowned store operations and royalties advertising contributions and other fees from us franchised stores as summarized in the following table

 

us companyowned stores

revenues from us companyowned store operations decreased 612 million or 119 in 2019 due primarily to the 2019 store sale this decrease in revenues was partially offset by a 28 increase in same store sales as compared to 2018

us franchise royalties and fees

revenues from us franchise operations increased 370 million or 95 in 2019 the increase was driven by a 32 increase in same store sales as compared to 2018 and an increase in the average number of stores open during the year resulting primarily from net store growth and to a lesser extent the 2019 store sale us franchise royalties and fees further benefited from an increase in revenues from fees paid by franchisees for the use of our technology platforms

us franchise advertising

 revenues from us franchise advertising increased 323 million or 90 in 2019 due primarily to higher same store sales and an increase in the average number of us franchised stores open during the year resulting primarily from net store growth and to a lesser extent the 2019 store sale

supply chain

revenues from supply chain operations are primarily comprised of sales of food equipment and supplies from our supply chain centers to substantially all of our us franchised stores and certain international franchised stores supply chain revenues increased 1616 million or 83 in 2019 this increase was due primarily to higher volumes from increased orders resulting from an increase in the average number of us franchise stores open during the year and an increase in market basket pricing to stores our market basket pricing to stores increased 17 during 2019 which resulted in an estimated 318 million increase in supply chain revenue

international franchise royalties and fees

international franchise revenues primarily consist of royalties from retail sales and other fees from our international franchise stores revenues from international franchise operations increased 163 million or 72 in 2019 this increase was due primarily to an increase in the average number of international stores open during 2019 as well as higher same store sales the negative impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates of approximately 89 million in 2019 partially offset these increases excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rates same store sales increased 19 in 2019 as compared to 2018

cost of sales  operating margin

consolidated cost of sales consists primarily of us companyowned store and supply chain costs incurred to generate related revenues components of consolidated cost of sales primarily include food labor and occupancy costs the changes to the consolidated operating margin which we define as revenues less cost of sales are summarized in the following table

 

the 998 million or 77 increase in consolidated operating margin was primarily driven by higher global franchise revenues and higher supply chain volumes but was partially offset by lower companyowned store margins resulting from the 2019 store sale franchise revenues do not have a cost of sales component so changes in these revenues have a disproportionate effect on the operating margin 

as a percentage of total revenues our consolidated operating margin increased 09 percentage points in 2019 due to higher global royalty revenues and an increase in companyowned store and supply chain operating margins companyowned store operating margin increased 10 percentage point in 2019 and supply chain operating margin increased 03 percentage points in 2019 these changes in margin are more fully discussed below 

us companyowned stores

the changes to us companyowned store operating margin which do not include other storelevel costs such as royalties and advertising are summarized in the following table

 

the 92 million or 79 decrease in the us companyowned store operating margin was due primarily to the 2019 store sale operating margin in 2019 was also negatively impacted by higher labor costs partially offset by higher same store sales as a percentage of store revenues the store operating margin increased 10 percentage point in 2019 as discussed in more detail below 

 

 

 

supply chain

the changes to the supply chain operating margin are summarized in the following table

 

the 235 million or 112 increase in the supply chain operating margin was due primarily to higher volumes from increased franchise retail sales as a percentage of supply chain revenues the supply chain operating margin increased 03 percentage points in 2019 due primarily to procurement savings and lower delivery costs offset in part by higher labor costs 

general and administrative expenses

general and administrative expenses increased 98 million or 26 in 2019 a pretax

gain of 59 million recognized from the sale of 12 companyowned stores in 2018 resulted in an increase in general and administrative expenses as compared to the prior year lower advertising expenses resulting primarily from the 2019 store sale partially offset these increases continued investments in technological initiatives and other areas also contributed to the increase in 2019

us franchise advertising

 us franchise advertising expenses increased 323 million or 90 in 2019 consistent with the increase in us franchise advertising revenue us franchise advertising costs are accrued and expensed when the related us franchise advertising revenues are recognized as our consolidated notforprofit

advertising fund is obligated to expend such revenues on advertising and these revenues cannot be used for general corporate purposes

interest income

interest income increased 07 million to 40 million in 2019 due to a higher average cash and cash equivalents balance and higher interest rates earned on our cash and cash equivalents

interest expense

interest expense increased 45 million to 1508 million in 2019 this increase was driven by a higher weighted average debt balance primarily due to our 2019 recapitalization and increased borrowings under our variable funding notes a higher weighted average borrowing rate also contributed to higher interest expense our weighted average borrowing rate was 41 in 2019 and was 40 in 2018 the increase in interest expense in 2019 was partially offset by 33 million of incremental interest expense recorded in 2018 in connection with the 2018 recapitalization

provision for income taxes

provision for income taxes increased 152 million to 819 million in 2019 and the effective tax rate increased to 170 in 2019 as compared to 156 in 2018 higher pretax

income and a 43 million valuation allowance primarily related to expected limitations on foreign tax credits contributed to the increase in tax expense higher excess tax benefits on equitybased compensation which are recorded as a reduction to the income tax provision partially offset these increases excess tax benefits recorded were higher by 19 million in 2019 as compared to 2018

liquidity and capital resources 

historically we have operated with minimal positive working capital or negative working capital primarily because our receivable collection periods and inventory turn rates are faster than the normal payment terms on our current liabilities we generally collect our receivables within three weeks from the date of the related sale and we generally experience multiple inventory turns per month in addition our sales are not typically seasonal which further limits our working capital requirements these factors coupled with the use of our ongoing cash flows from operations to service our debt obligations invest in our business pay dividends and repurchase our common stock reduce our working capital amounts as of december 29 2019 we had working capital of 1210 million excluding restricted cash and cash equivalents of 2093 million advertising fund assets restricted of 1054 million and advertising fund liabilities of 1019 million working capital includes total unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of 1906 million 

as of december 29 2019 we had approximately 1574 million of restricted cash and cash equivalents held for future principal and interest payments and other working capital requirements of our assetbacked securitization structure 487 million of restricted cash equivalents held in a threemonth interest reserve as required by the related debt agreements and 32 million of other restricted cash for a total of 2093 million of restricted cash and cash equivalents as of december 29 2019 we also held 840 million of advertising fund restricted cash and cash equivalents which can only be used for activities that promote the domino’s brand

under the provisions of the company’s previously existing debt agreements during the first and second quarters of 2017 the company had a leverage ratio of less than 45x and accordingly did not make previously scheduled debt amortization payments in accordance with the debt agreements subsequent to the 2017 recapitalization and through 2018 the company’s leverage ratios exceeded the leverage ratio of 50x and accordingly the company began making the scheduled amortization payments

capital expenditures 

in the past three years we have invested approximately 2955 million in capital expenditures in 2019 we invested 856 million in capital expenditures which primarily related to investments in our proprietary internally developed pointofsale

system domino’s pulse our internal enterprise systems our digital ordering platform supply chain centers asset upgrades for our existing companyowned stores and new companyowned stores we did not have any material commitments for capital expenditures as of december 29 2019

the following table illustrates the main components of our cash flows 

 

operating activities 

cash provided by operating activities increased 1028 million in 2019 due to the positive impact of changes in operating assets and liabilities of 590 million an increase in net income of 387 million and higher noncash

amounts of 51 million the positive impact of changes in operating assets and liabilities was primarily related to the timing of payments on accounts payable and accrued liabilities during 2019 as compared to 2018

cash provided by operating activities increased 529 million in 2018 primarily due to an increase in net income of 841 million this increase was partially offset by the negative impact of changes in operating assets and liabilities of 321 million our cash outflows for operating assets and liabilities in 2018 were higher than in 2017 due primarily to higher inventory balances and the timing of payments on accounts payable and accrued liabilities 

we are focused on continually improving our net income and cash flow from operations and management expects to continue to generate positive cash flows from operating activities for the foreseeable future

market risk 

we do not engage in speculative transactions nor do we hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes in connection with the 2017 recapitalization we issued fixed and floating rate notes and at december 29 2019 we are exposed to interest rate risk on borrowings under our 2017 fiveyear floating rate notes and our 2019 variable funding notes as of december 29 2019 we did not have any outstanding borrowings under our 2019 variable funding notes our 2017 fiveyear floating rate notes and our 2019 variable funding notes bear interest at fluctuating interest rates based on libor a hypothetical 10 adverse change in the libor rate would have resulted in higher interest expense of approximately 31 million in 2019 

there is currently uncertainty around whether libor will continue to exist after 2021 if libor ceases to exist we may need to renegotiate our loan documents and we cannot predict what alternative index would be negotiated with our lenders as a result our interest expense could increase in which event we may have difficulties making interest payments and funding our other fixed costs and our available cash flow for general corporate requirements may be adversely affected 

our fixed rate debt exposes the company to changes in market interest rates reflected in the fair value of the debt and to the risk that the company may need to refinance maturing debt with new debt at a higher rate 

we are exposed to market risks from changes in commodity prices during the normal course of business we purchase cheese and certain other food products that are affected by changes in commodity prices and as a result we are subject to volatility in our food costs we may periodically enter into financial instruments to manage this risk we do not engage in speculative transactions nor do we hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes in instances when we use fixed pricing agreements with our suppliers these agreements cover our physical commodity needs are not netsettled

and are accounted for as normal purchases

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

we have exposure to various foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations for revenues generated by our operations outside the us which can adversely impact our net income and cash flows approximately 67 of our total revenues in 2019 65 of our total revenues in 2018 and 74 of our total revenues in 2017 were derived from our international franchise segment a majority of which were denominated in foreign currencies we also operate dough manufacturing and distribution facilities in canada which generate revenues denominated in canadian dollars we do not enter into financial instruments to manage this foreign currency exchange risk a hypothetical 10 adverse change in the foreign currency rates for our international markets would have resulted in a negative impact on royalty revenues of approximately 212 million in 2019

the domino’s business model is straightforward we handcraft and serve quality food at a competitive price with easy ordering access and efficient service enhanced by our technology innovations our dough is generally made fresh and distributed to stores around the world by us and our franchisees 

domino’s generates revenues and earnings by charging royalties and fees to our franchisees royalties are ongoing percentofsales fees for use of the domino’s ® brand marks the company also generates revenues and earnings by selling food equipment and supplies to franchisees primarily in the us and canada and by operating a number of our own stores franchisees profit by selling pizza and other complementary items to their local customers in our international markets we generally grant geographical rights to the domino’s pizza ® brand to master franchisees these master franchisees are charged with developing their geographical area and they may profit by subfranchising and selling food and equipment to those subfranchisees as well as by running pizza stores everyone in the system can benefit including the end consumer who can purchase domino’s menu items for themselves and their family conveniently and economically 

the domino’s business model can yield strong returns for our franchise owners and companyowned stores it can also yield significant cash flow to us through a consistent franchise royalty payment and supply chain revenue stream with moderate capital expenditures we have historically returned cash to shareholders through dividend payments and share repurchases since becoming a publiclytraded company

our history 

we pioneered the pizza delivery business and built domino’s pizza into one of the most widelyrecognized consumer brands in the world we have been delivering quality affordable food to our customers since 1960 when brothers thomas and james monaghan borrowed 900 to purchase a small pizza store in ypsilanti michigan thomas purchased his brother’s share of the business shortly thereafter concentrating first on building stores near college campuses and military bases in the 1960s and 1970s the brand grew quickly in the 1980s in urban markets and near residential communities we became “domino’s pizza” in 1965 and opened our first franchised store in 1967 the first international stores opened in 1983 in canada and australia 

monaghan sold 93 of his economic stake in the company in 1998 to bain capital llc then sold and transferred his remaining stake in the company in 2004 when we completed our initial public offering 

since 1998 the company has been structured with a leveraged balance sheet and has completed a number of recapitalization events the company’s most recent recapitalization transaction in 2018 the “2018 recapitalization” primarily consisted of the issuance of 8250 million of fixed rate notes and the repurchase and retirement of 4900 million of previously outstanding fixed rate notes as of december 30 2018 the company had 353 billion in total debt which included debt from its 2018 recapitalization and its previous recapitalization transactions in 2017 and 2015 the “2017 recapitalization” and the “2015 recapitalization” and together with the 2018 recapitalization the “2018 2017 and 2015 recapitalizations” excess proceeds from our 2018 2017 and 2015 recapitalizations were used primarily to repurchase shares of our common stock 

we relaunched our brand in the us in late 2009 by introducing a new recipe for our core pizza product since 2008 the majority of our menu has changed either through the improvement of existing products or the introduction of new products such as our handmade pan pizza and specialty chicken during this time frame we also began expanding our focus on technology through our development of innovative ordering platforms and other technological advancements such as the launch of our piece of the pie rewards ® loyalty program in 2015 and the launch of domino’s delivery hotspots ® in 2018 globally we opened our 10000 th store in 2012 and our 15000 th store in 2018 in 2013 we announced a plan requiring all stores to adopt our new carryout friendly “pizza theater” store design which is more inviting to customers and allows them to see their orders being made fresh in front of them the majority of our us and international stores have completed these remodels as of the end of 2018 

 

our industry 

the us qsr pizza category is large and fragmented from 2008 through 2018 the us qsr pizza category has grown from 328 billion to 365 billion it is the secondlargest category within the 2996 billion us qsr sector the us qsr pizza category is primarily comprised of delivery dinein and carryout 

in the us we compete primarily in the delivery and carryout segments of the pizza industry we are the market share leader in the delivery segment and we are amongst the top three chains in share in the carryout segment delivery segment sales of 98 billion in 2018 down from 103 billion in 2008 account for approximately 27 of total us qsr pizza the delivery segment declined slightly during the period from 2008 to 2012 and has increased slightly since 2012 from 97 billion in 2012 to 98 billion in 2018 the three industry leaders including domino’s account for over 56 of us pizza delivery based on reported consumer spending with the remaining sales going to regional chains and independent establishments from 2008 to 2018 the carryout segment grew from 141 billion to 171 billion the four industry leaders including domino’s account for approximately 48 of the carryout segment 

in contrast to the us international pizza delivery is relatively underdeveloped with only domino’s and two other competitors having a significant global presence we believe that demand for pizza and pizza delivery is large and growing throughout the world driven by international consumers’ increasing emphasis on convenience and the proven success of our 35 years of conducting business abroad 

our competition 

the global pizza delivery and carryout segments are highly competitive in the us we compete against regional and local companies as well as national chains pizza hut ®  papa john’s ® and little caesars pizza ®  internationally we compete primarily with pizza hut ®  papa john’s ® and countryspecific national and local pizzerias we generally compete on the basis of product quality location image service technology convenience and price our business and those of our competitors can be affected by changes in consumer tastes economic conditions demographic trends and consumers’ disposable income we also compete on a broader scale with other food and food delivery companies we compete not only for customers but also for employees suitable real estate sites and qualified franchisees 

our customers 

the company’s business is not dependent upon a single retail customer or small group of customers including franchisees no customer accounted for more than 10 of total consolidated revenues in 2018 2017 or 2016 our largest franchisee based on store count domino’s pizza enterprises dmp asx operates 2383 stores in seven international markets and accounts for 15 of our total store count revenues from this master franchisee accounted for 14 of our consolidated revenues in 2018 our international business unit only requires a modest amount of general and administrative expenses to support its markets and does not have costs of sales therefore the vast majority of these royalty revenues result in profits to us 

our menu 

we offer a menu designed to present an attractive quality offering to customers while keeping it simple enough to minimize order errors and expedite ordertaking and food preparation our basic menu features pizza products with varying sizes and crust types our typical store also offers ovenbaked sandwiches pasta boneless chicken and wings bread side items desserts and soft drink products international markets vary toppings by country and culture such as squid topping in japan or spicy cheese in india and often feature regional specialty items such as a banana and cinnamon dessert pizza in brazil 

store image and operations 

we have been focused primarily on pizza delivery for nearly 60 years as well as carryout as a significant component of our business in 2012 we introduced our carryoutfriendly pizza theater store design the majority of our us and international stores have converted to this design as of the end of 2018 many stores offer casual seating and enable customers to watch the preparation of their orders but do not offer a fullservice dinein experience as a result our stores generally do not require expensive restaurant facilities and staffing 

 

our business segments 

we operate and report three business segments us stores international franchise and supply chain 

us stores 

our us stores segment consists primarily of our franchise operations which consist of 5486 franchised stores located in the united states we also operate a network of 390 us companyowned stores 

during 2018 our us stores segment accounted for 126 billion or 37 of our consolidated revenues we use our companyowned stores as test sites for new products and promotions as well as operational improvements we also use them for training new store managers and operations team members as well as developing prospective franchisees while we are primarily a franchised business we continuously evaluate our mix of us companyowned and franchise stores 

we maintain a productive relationship with our independent franchise owners through regional franchise teams distributing materials that help franchise stores comply with our standards and using franchise advisory groups that facilitate communications between us and our franchisees 

us franchise profile 

as of december 30 2018 our network of 5486 us franchise stores were owned and operated by 793 independent us franchisees our franchise formula enables franchisees to benefit from our brand name with a relatively low initial capital investment as of december 30 2018 the average us franchisee owned and operated seven stores and had been in our franchise system for over 18 years at the same time 17 of our us franchisees operated more than 50 stores including our largest us franchisee who operated 179 stores and 262 of our us franchisees each operated one store 

we apply rigorous standards to prospective us franchisees we generally require them to manage a store for at least one year and graduate from our franchise management school before being granted a franchise this enables us to observe the operational and financial performance of a potential franchisee prior to entering into a longterm contract substantially all of our 793 independent us franchise owners started their careers with us as delivery drivers or in other instore positions which we believe offers advantages in terms of familiarity with our business and store operations in addition we generally restrict the ability of us franchisees to be involved in other businesses which we believe helps focus our franchisees’ attention on operating their stores we believe these characteristics and standards are largely unique within the franchise industry and have resulted in qualified and focused franchisees operating domino’s stores 

us franchise agreements 

we enter into franchise agreements with us franchisees under which the franchisee is generally granted the right to operate a store in a particular location for a term of ten years with an ability to renew for an additional term of ten years we have a franchise contract renewal rate of approximately 99 under the current standard franchise agreement we assign an exclusive area of primary responsibility to each franchised store each franchisee is generally required to pay a 55 royalty fee on sales in certain instances we will collect lower rates based on new store incentives 

our us stores currently contribute 6 of their sales to fund national marketing and advertising campaigns subject in certain instances to lower rates based on certain incentives and waivers these funds are administered by domino’s national advertising fund inc “dnaf” our consolidated notforprofit advertising subsidiary the funds are primarily used to purchase media for advertising but also support market research field communications public relations commercial production talent payments and other activities to promote the brand in addition to the national and marketlevel advertising contributions us stores spend additional funds on local store marketing activities 

we have the contractual right subject to state law to terminate a franchise agreement for a variety of reasons including but not limited to a franchisee’s failure to adhere to the company’s franchise agreement failure to make required payments or failure to adhere to specified company policies and standards 

 

international franchise 

our international franchise segment is comprised of a network of franchised stores in more than 85 international markets at december 30 2018 we had 10038 international franchise stores during 2018 this segment accounted for 2247 million or 6 of our consolidated revenues the principal sources of revenues from those operations are royalty payments generated by retail sales from franchised stores 

our international franchisees employ our basic standard operating model and adapt it to satisfy the local eating habits and consumer preferences of various regions outside the us currently the vast majority of our international stores operate under master franchise agreements 

we believe domino’s appeals to potential international franchisees because of our recognized brand name and technological leadership the moderate capital expenditures required to open and operate our stores and our system’s favorable store economics stores in eight of our top ten international markets in terms of store count are operated by master franchise companies that are publicly traded on stock exchanges in india jublfood ns the united kingdom dom l mexico alsea mx australia dmp asx which operates the stores in our australia japan france and germany markets and turkey dpeu l the following table shows our store count as of december 30 2018 in our top ten international markets which accounted for approximately 64 of our international stores as of december 30 2018 

 

 international franchisee profile 

the vast majority of our markets outside of the us are operated by master franchisees with franchise and distribution rights for entire regions or countries in a few select markets we franchise directly to individual store operators prospective master franchisees are required to possess local market knowledge to establish and develop domino’s pizza stores with the ability to identify and access targeted real estate sites as well as expertise in local laws customs culture and consumer behavior we also seek candidates that have access to sufficient capital to meet growth and development plans 

master franchise agreements 

our master franchise agreements generally grant the franchisee exclusive rights to develop and subfranchise stores and the right to operate supply chain centers in particular geographic areas agreements are generally for a term of ten years with options to renew for additional terms the agreements typically contain growth clauses requiring franchisees to open a minimum number of stores within a specified period the master franchisee is generally required to pay an initial onetime franchise fee as well as an additional franchise fee upon the opening of each new store the master franchisee is also required to pay a continuing royalty fee as a percentage of sales which varies among international markets and averaged approximately 30 in 2018 

supply chain 

our supply chain segment operates 19 regional dough manufacturing and food supply chain centers in the us one thin crust manufacturing center one vegetable processing center and one center providing equipment and supplies to our us and certain international stores we plan to continue investing in additional supply chain centers and capacity initiatives in the future we also operate five dough manufacturing and food supply chain centers in canada our supply chain segment leases a fleet of more than 800 tractors and trailers during 2018 our supply chain segment accounted for 194 billion or nearly 57 of our consolidated revenues 

our centers produce fresh dough and purchase receive store and deliver quality food and other complementary items to our us stores and most of our canadian franchised stores we regularly supply over 6300 stores with various food and supplies our supply chain segment made approximately 766000 fullservice deliveries in 2018 or approximately 25 deliveries per store per week and we produced over 573 million pounds of fresh dough during 2018 

 

we believe our franchisees voluntarily choose to obtain food supplies and equipment from us because we offer the most efficient convenient and costeffective alternative while also offering both quality and consistency our supply chain segment offers profitsharing arrangements to franchisees who purchase all of their food for their stores from our centers these profitsharing arrangements generally offer participating franchisees and companyowned stores with 50 or a higher percentage in the case of companyowned stores and certain franchisees who operate a larger number of stores of their regional supply chain center’s pretax profits we believe these arrangements strengthen our ties and provide aligned benefits with franchisees 

thirdparty suppliers 

over half of our annual food spend is with suppliers with whom we have maintained a partnership of at least 20 years our supply partners are required to meet strict quality standards to ensure food safety we review and evaluate these partners’ quality assurance programs through among other actions onsite visits thirdparty audits and product evaluations to ensure compliance with our standards we believe the length and quality of our relationships with thirdparty suppliers provides us with priority service and quality products at competitive prices 

cheese is our largest food cost the price we charge to our us franchisees for cheese is based on the chicago mercantile exchange cheddar block price plus a supply chain markup as cheese prices fluctuate our revenues and margin percentages in our supply chain segment also fluctuate however actual supply chain dollar margins remain unchanged we currently purchase our us pizza cheese from a single supplier under our september 2017 agreement our us supplier agreed to provide an uninterrupted supply of cheese and the company agreed to a sevenyear pricing schedule to purchase all of its us pizza cheese from this supplier while we expect to meet the terms of this agreement if we do not we will be required to repay the certain negotiated cost savings as outlined in the agreement the majority of our meat toppings in the us come from a single supplier under a contract that expires in june 2022 we have the right to terminate these arrangements for quality failures and for uncured breaches 

we are party to a multiyear agreement with cocacola ® for the contiguous us this contract renegotiated in december 2013 provides for cocacola to continue to be our exclusive beverage supplier and expires in march 2019 

we believe alternative thirdparty suppliers are available for all of these referenced products while we may incur additional costs if we are required to replace any of our supply partners we do not believe such additional costs would have a material adverse effect on our business we continually evaluate each supply category to determine the optimal sourcing strategy 

we have not experienced any significant shortages of supplies or delays in receiving our inventories or products prices charged to us by our supply partners are subject to fluctuation and we have historically been able to pass increased costs and savings on to stores we periodically enter into supplier contracts to manage the risk from changes in commodity prices we do not engage in speculative transactions nor do we hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes 

our strengths 

strong brand equity 

we are the largest pizza company in the world based on global retail sales we believe our domino’s pizza brand is one of the most widelyrecognized consumer brands in the world we are the recognized world leader in pizza delivery and have a significant business in carryout we believe consumers associate our brand with the timely delivery of quality affordable food 

over the past five years our us franchise and companyowned stores have invested an estimated 19 billion in national cooperative and local advertising our international franchisees also invest significant amounts in advertising efforts in their markets we continue to reinforce our brand with extensive advertising through various media channels we have also enhanced the strength of our brand through marketing affiliations with brands such as cocacola 

we are the number one pizza delivery company in the us with a 311 share of pizza delivery based on reported consumer spending with 5876 stores located in the us our store delivery areas cover a majority of us households our share position and scale allow us to leverage our purchasing power supply chain strength and marketing investments we believe our scale and market coverage allow us to effectively serve our customers’ demands for convenience and timely delivery outside the us we have significant market share positions in many of the markets in which we compete 

 

strong and proven business model 

our business model generates us and international franchise royalties and fees supply chain revenue and retail sales at companyowned stores we have developed this model over our many years of operation and it is anchored by strong storelevel economics which provide an entrepreneurial incentive for our franchisees and historically has generated demand for new stores our franchise system in turn has produced strong and consistent earnings for us through royalty payments and through supply chain revenues with moderate capital expenditures by us 

we developed a costefficient store model characterized by a delivery and carryoutoriented store design with moderate capital requirements and a menu of quality affordable items at the store level we believe the simplicity and efficiency of our operations give us significant advantages over our competitors who in many cases also focus on dinein or have broader menu offerings at the supply chain level we believe we provide quality good value and consistency for our franchise customers while also driving profits for us which we share with our franchisees 

our menu simplifies and streamlines production and delivery processes and maximizes economies of scale on purchases of our principal food items in addition our stores are generally smaller and less expensive to build furnish and maintain as compared to many other restaurant concepts new stores built in our pizza theater design are often slightly larger than stores we have built in the past to create a better experience for our carryout and dinein customers however they are still generally smaller and less expensive than many other restaurant concepts the combination of this efficient store model and strong sales volume has resulted in favorable storelevel financial returns and we believe makes domino’s pizza an attractive business opportunity for existing and prospective franchisees around the world we and our franchisees are continuing to focus on growing our store count around the world to increase our presence in all of our markets to better serve our customers 

we believe our store economics have led to a strong welldiversified franchise system this established franchise system has produced strong cash flows and earnings for us enabling us to invest in the domino’s pizza brand stores technology and supply chain centers pay significant dividends repurchase and retire shares of our common stock and service our debt obligations 

technological innovation 

technological innovation is vital to our brand and our longterm success digital ordering is critical to competing in the global pizza industry in 2018 more than half of all global retail sales were derived from digital channels primarily through our online ordering website and mobile applications we believe we are among the largest ecommerce retailers in terms of annual transactions after launching digital ordering in the us in 2008 we made the strategic decision in 2010 to develop our own online ordering platform and to manage this important and growing area of our business internally over the next five years we launched mobile applications that cover 95 of the smartphones and tablets on the us market in 2013 we launched an enhanced online ordering profiles platform allowing customers the ability to reorder their favorite order in as few as five clicks or 30 seconds in 2014 we introduced “dom” a voice ordering application which we believe is the first in the restaurant industry and we also made the domino’s tracker ® available on our ordering platforms in 2015 we introduced several innovative ordering platforms including samsung smart tv ®  twitter and text message using a pizza emoji we continued this trend of innovation in 2016 with the introduction of zeroclick ordering as well as adding google home facebook messenger apple watch and amazon echo to our ordering platforms in 2017 as part of an industryfirst collaboration with ford motor company we began a meaningful test of delivery using selfdriving vehicles in april 2018 we launched domino’s delivery hotspots featuring over 200000 nontraditional delivery locations including parks beaches local landmarks and other unique gathering spots 

the company’s piece of the pie rewards loyalty program launched in 2015 is meant to reward customers with a program that is simple to understand and easy to use upon signing up for the program customers become rewards members and can earn points for online orders when rewards members reach a certain amount of points they can redeem their points for free pizza rewards members may also receive exclusive membersonly discounts and bonus offers we may also occasionally provide additional opportunities for participating customers to benefit under the piece of the pie rewards program 

all of this improved functionality has been developed to work seamlessly with our domino’s pulse ™ pointofsale system our domino’s pulse system is designed to drive operating efficiencies for our franchisees and our corporate management and assist franchisees in independently managing their business we have installed domino’s pulse in every companyowned store in the us in more than 99 of our us franchised stores and in approximately 72 of our international stores 

we believe utilizing domino’s pulse with our integrated technology solutions throughout our system provides us with competitive advantages over other concepts we intend to continue to enhance and grow our online ordering digital marketing and technological capabilities 

 

product innovation 

in late 2009 we reintroduced our core handtossed pizza in the us with a new recipe which we believe has contributed to continued growth in customer reorder rate consumer traffic and increased sales this recipe is now in use in other markets around the world our nearly 60 years of innovation have resulted in numerous new product developments including our more recent innovations of handmade pan pizza specialty chicken parmesan bread bites stuffed cheesy bread marbled cookie brownie and bread twists among others product innovation is also present in our global markets where our master franchisees have the ability to recommend products to suit their local market tastes products include the mayo jaga in japan bacon potatoes and sweet mayonnaise and the saumoneta in france light cream potatoes onions smoked salmon and dill 

internal dough manufacturing and supply chain system 

in addition to generating significant revenues and earnings in the us and canada we believe our vertically integrated dough manufacturing and supply chain system enhances the quality and consistency of our products enhances our relationships with franchisees and leverages economies of scale to offer lower costs to our stores it also allows store managers to better focus on store operations and customer service by relieving them of the responsibility of mixing dough in the stores and sourcing other ingredients many of our international master franchisees also profit from running supply chain businesses 

our ideals 

we believe in opportunity hard work inspired solutions winning together embracing community and uncommon honesty 

opportunity abounds at domino’s you can start in an entrylevel position and become a store owner – in fact substantially all of our independent us franchise owners started their careers with us as delivery drivers or in other instore positions thousands of other team members – supervisors trainers quality auditors international business consultants marketers and executives – also began their careers in the stores internal growth and providing opportunities for anyone willing to work hard are the foundation of our core beliefs 

the ideals of inspired solutions uncommon honesty and winning together were driving forces behind the relaunch of our brand we were inspired by our harshest critics when it came to the perceived taste of our pizza our solution was not simply more advertising the solution was to create a new recipe and a broader menu of greattasting products our marketing campaign was shockingly honest in its approach telling consumers and showing them via television ads that we heard their negative feedback and were listening and without the buyin from our franchise owners we couldn’t have done it we believe that we can’t focus solely on the company’s success we must focus on making our stores and our franchisees successful that’s winning together 

community involvement

 item 1a risk factors 

the quick service restaurant pizza category is highly competitive and such competition could adversely affect our operating results 

in the us we compete against regional and local companies as well as national chains pizza hut ®  papa john’s ® and little caesars pizza ®  internationally we compete primarily with pizza hut ®  papa john’s ® and countryspecific national and local companies we could experience increased competition from existing or new companies in the pizza category which could create increasing pressures to grow our business in order to maintain our market share additionally we face growing competition from the supermarket industry and meal kit and food delivery providers with the improvement of prepared food offerings and the trend towards convergence in grocery deli retail and restaurant services if we are unable to maintain our competitive position we could experience downward pressure on prices lower demand for our products reduced margins the inability to take advantage of new business opportunities and the loss of market share all of which would have an adverse effect on our operating results and could cause our stock price to decline 

we also compete on a broader scale with quick service and other international national regional and local restaurants competition from delivery aggregators and other food delivery services has also increased in recent years the overall food service market and the quick service restaurant sector are intensely competitive with respect to food quality price service image convenience and concept and are often affected by changes in 

 

  

  

  

  

 we compete within the food service market and the quick service restaurant sector not only for customers but also for management and hourly employees including drivers suitable real estate sites and qualified franchisees our supply chain segment is also subject to competition from outside suppliers while all us franchisees purchased food equipment and supplies from us in 2018 us franchisees are not required to purchase food equipment or supplies from us and they may choose to purchase from outside suppliers if other suppliers who meet our qualification standards were to offer lower prices or better service to our franchisees for their ingredients and supplies and as a result our franchisees chose not to purchase from our us supply chain centers our financial condition business and results of operations would be adversely affected 

if we fail to successfully implement our growth strategy which includes opening new us and international stores our ability to increase our revenues and operating profits could be adversely affected 

a significant component of our growth strategy includes the opening of new us and international stores we and our franchisees face many challenges in opening new stores including among others 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 the opening of additional franchise stores also depends in part upon the availability of prospective franchisees who meet our criteria our failure to add a significant number of new stores would adversely affect our ability to increase revenues and operating income additionally our growth strategy and the success of new stores depend in large part on the availability of suitable store sites if we and our franchisees are not able to secure leases in desired locations on favorable terms or to renew such leases our business and results of operations may be adversely affected 

we and our franchisees are currently planning to expand our us and international operations in many of the markets where we currently operate and in select new markets this may require considerable management time as well as startup expenses for market development before any significant revenues and earnings are generated operations in new foreign markets may achieve low margins or may be unprofitable and expansion in existing markets may be affected by local economic and market conditions therefore as we continue to expand internationally we or our franchisees may not experience the operating margins we expect our results of operations may be negatively impacted and our common stock price may decline 

 

we may also pursue strategic acquisitions as part of our business if we are able to identify acquisition candidates such acquisitions may be financed to the extent permitted under our debt agreements with substantial debt or with potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities 

the food service market is affected by consumer preferences and perceptions changes in these preferences and perceptions may reduce the demand for our products which would reduce sales and harm our business 

food service businesses are affected by changes in consumer tastes international national regional and local economic conditions and demographic trends for instance if prevailing health or dietary preferences cause consumers to avoid pizza and other products we offer in favor of foods that are perceived as healthier our business and operating results would be harmed moreover because we are primarily dependent on a single product if consumer demand for pizza should decrease our business would suffer more than if we had a more diversified menu as many other food service businesses do the preferences of customers also may change as a result of advances in technology or alternative delivery methods or channels if we are not able to respond to these changes or our competitors respond to these changes more effectively our business and operating results could be adversely affected 

our inability or failure to recognize respond to and effectively manage the accelerated impact of social media could adversely impact our business 

in recent years there has been a marked increase in the use of social media platforms including blogs chat platforms social media websites and other forms of internetbased communications that allow individuals access to a broad audience of consumers and other persons the rising popularity of social media and other consumeroriented technologies has increased the speed and accessibility of information dissemination the dissemination of information via social media could harm our business brand reputation marketing partners financial condition and results of operations regardless of the information’s accuracy this could include negative publicity related to our food products or stores or negative publicity related to actions by our executives team members or franchisees 

in addition we frequently use social media to communicate with consumers and the public in general failure to use social media effectively could lead to a decline in brand value and revenue other risks associated with the use of social media include improper disclosure of proprietary information negative comments about our brand exposure of personally identifiable information fraud hoaxes or malicious dissemination of false information

reports of foodborne illness or food tampering could reduce sales and harm our business 

reports whether true or not of foodborne illnesses such as e coli avian flu bovine spongiform encephalopathy hepatitis a trichinosis or salmonella and injuries caused by food tampering have in the past severely injured the reputations of participants in the qsr sector and could in the future as well the potential for acts of terrorism affecting our global food supply also exists and if such an event occurs it could have a negative impact on us and could severely hurt sales and profits in addition our reputation is an important asset as a result anything that damages our reputation could immediately and severely affect our sales and profits media reports of illnesses and injuries whether accurate or not could force some stores to close or otherwise reduce sales at such stores moreover as described above social media has dramatically increased the rate at which negative publicity including as it relates to foodborne illness can be disseminated before there is any meaningful opportunity to respond to or address an issue even reports of foodborne illnesses or food tampering occurring solely at the restaurants of competitors could by resulting in negative publicity about the restaurant industry adversely affect us on a local regional national or international basis 

we do not have longterm contracts with certain of our suppliers and as a result they could seek to significantly increase prices or fail to deliver 

we do not have longterm contracts or arrangements with certain of our suppliers although in the past we have not experienced significant problems with our suppliers our suppliers may implement significant price increases or may not meet our requirements in a timely fashion or at all the occurrence of any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

shortages or interruptions in the supply or delivery of fresh food products could adversely affect our operating results 

we and our franchisees are dependent on frequent deliveries of food products that meet our specifications in addition we have single suppliers or a limited number of suppliers for certain of our ingredients including pizza cheese and meat toppings while we believe there are adequate reserve quantities and potential alternative suppliers shortages or interruptions in the supply of food products caused by increased demand capacity constraints problems in production or distribution financial or other difficulties of suppliers inclement weather or other conditions could adversely affect the availability quality and cost of ingredients could adversely affect our operating results 

 

increases in food labor and other costs could adversely affect our profitability and operating results 

an increase in our operating costs could adversely affect our profitability factors such as inflation increased food costs increased labor and employee health and benefit costs increased rent costs and increased energy costs may adversely affect our operating costs most of the factors affecting costs are beyond our control and in many cases we may not be able to pass along these increased costs to our customers or franchisees most ingredients used in our pizza particularly cheese are subject to significant price fluctuations as a result of seasonality weather demand and other factors cheese is a significant cost to us representing approximately 2025 of the market basket purchased by our companyowned stores additionally while we strive to engage in a competitive bidding process for our ingredients because certain of these ingredients including meat products may only be available from a limited number of vendors we may not always be able to do so effectively furthermore if we need to seek new suppliers we may be subject to pricing or other terms less favorable to us than those reflected in our current supply arrangements labor costs are largely a function of the minimum wage for a majority of our store personnel and certain supply chain center personnel and generally are also a function of the availability of labor several states in which we operate have recently approved minimum wage increases as minimum wage increases are implemented in these states or if such increases are approved and implemented in other states in which we operate we expect our labor costs will continue to increase the advent of legislation aimed at predictive scheduling could impact labor for our stores and our franchisees’ stores additionally while we do not currently have any unionized employees if a significant portion of our employees were to become unionized our labor costs could increase and our business could be negatively affected by other union requirements that increase our costs disrupt our business reduce our flexibility and impact our employee culture labor costs and food costs including cheese generally represent approximately 50 to 60 of the sales at a typical companyowned store 

any prolonged disruption in the operations of any of our dough manufacturing and supply chain centers could harm our business 

we operate 19 regional dough manufacturing and supply chain centers one thin crust manufacturing center and one vegetable processing center in the us and five dough manufacturing and supply chain centers in canada we plan to continue investing in additional supply chain capacity in the future 

our us dough manufacturing and supply chain centers service all of our companyowned and us franchise stores as a result any prolonged disruption in the operations of any of these facilities whether due to technical or labor difficulties destruction or damage to the facility real estate issues limited capacity or other reasons could adversely affect our business and operating results 

our success depends in part upon effective advertising and lower advertising funds may reduce our ability to adequately market the domino’s pizza brand 

we have been routinely named a leading national advertiser by advertising age  each domino’s store located in the contiguous us is obligated to pay a percentage of its sales in advertising fees in fiscal 2018 each store in the contiguous us generally was required to contribute 6 of their sales to dnaf subject in certain instances to lower rates based on certain incentives and waivers which uses such fees for national advertising in addition to contributions for local marketlevel advertising we currently anticipate that this 6 contribution rate will remain in place for the foreseeable future while additional funds for advertising in the past have been provided by us our franchisees and other third parties none of these additional funds are legally required the lack of continued financial support for advertising activities could significantly curtail our marketing efforts which may in turn materially and adversely affect our business and our operating results 

we face risks of litigation investigations enforcement actions and negative publicity from customers franchisees suppliers employees regulators and others in the ordinary course of business which can or could divert our financial and management resources litigation investigations enforcement actions or publicity may adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations 

claims of illness or injury relating to food quality or food handling are common in the food service industry and vehicular accidents and injuries occur in the food delivery business claims within our industry of improper supplier actions also occasionally arise that if made against one of our suppliers could potentially damage our brand image in addition class action lawsuits have been filed and may continue to be filed against various quick service restaurants alleging among other things that quick service restaurants have failed to disclose the health risks associated with highfat foods and that quick service restaurant marketing practices have encouraged obesity state attorney general offices or other regulators may initiate investigations or enforcement actions against us in addition to decreasing our sales and profitability and diverting our management resources adverse publicity or a substantial settlement fine penalty or judgment against us could negatively impact our financial condition results of operations and brand reputation thereby hindering our ability to attract and retain franchisees and grow our business 

 

further we may be subject to employee franchisee and other claims in the future based on among other things discrimination harassment wrongful termination and wage rest break and meal break issues and those claims relating to overtime compensation we have been and continue to be subject to these types of claims if one or more of these claims were to be successful or if there is a significant increase in the number of these claims or if we receive significant negative publicity our business financial condition and operating results could be harmed 

loss of key employees or our inability to attract and retain new qualified employees could hurt our business and inhibit our ability to operate and grow successfully 

our success in the highly competitive pizza delivery and carryout business will continue to depend to a significant extent on our leadership team and other key management personnel although we have entered into employment agreements with richard e allison jr and russell j weiner each of these executives may terminate his agreement on ninety days’ notice our other executive officers may terminate their employment pursuant to their employment agreements at any time as a result we may not be able to retain our executive officers and key personnel or attract additional qualified management while we do not have longterm employment agreements with our executive officers for all of our executive officers we have noncompete and nonsolicitation agreements that extend for 24 months following the termination of such executive officer’s employment our success will also continue to depend on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel to operate our stores dough manufacturing and supply chain centers and international operations the loss of these employees or our inability to recruit and retain qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 

adverse global economic conditions subject us to additional risk 

our financial condition and results of operations are impacted by global markets and economic conditions over which neither we nor our franchisees have control an economic downturn including deterioration in the economic conditions in the us or international markets where we compete may result in a reduction in the demand for our products longer payment cycles slower adoption of new technologies and increased price competition

poor economic conditions may adversely affect the ability of our franchisees to pay royalties or amounts owed and could have a material adverse impact on our ability to pursue our growth strategy which would reduce cash collections and in turn may materially and adversely affect our ability to service our debt obligations 

our international operations subject us to additional risk such risks and costs may differ in each country in which we and our franchisees do business and may cause our profitability to decline due to increased costs 

we conduct a significant and growing portion of our business outside the us our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected if global markets in which our franchise stores compete are affected by changes in political economic or other factors these factors over which neither we nor our franchisees have control may include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

fluctuations in the value of the us dollar in relation to other currencies may lead to lower revenues and earnings 

exchange rate fluctuations could have an adverse effect on our results of operations approximately 65 of our total revenues in 2018 74 of our total revenues in 2017 and 72 of our total revenues in 2016 were derived from our international franchise segment a majority of which were denominated in foreign currencies we also operate dough manufacturing and distribution facilities in canada which generate revenues denominated in canadian dollars sales made by franchise stores outside the us are denominated in the currency of the country in which the store is located and this currency could become less valuable in us dollars as a result of exchange rate fluctuations unfavorable currency fluctuations could lead to increased prices to customers outside the us or lower profitability to our franchisees outside the us or could result in lower revenues for us on a us dollar basis from such customers and franchisees a hypothetical 10 adverse change in the foreign currency rates in our international markets would have resulted in a negative impact on international royalty revenues of approximately 200 million in 2018 

our earnings and business growth strategy depends on the success of our franchisees and we may be harmed by actions taken by our franchisees or employees of our franchisees that are outside of our control 

a significant portion of our earnings comes from royalties and fees generated by our franchise stores franchisees are independent operators and their employees are not our employees we provide tools for franchisees to use in training their employees but the quality of franchise store operations and our brand and branded products may be diminished by any number of factors beyond our control franchisees may not operate stores in a manner consistent with our standards and requirements or they or their employees may take other actions that adversely affect the value of our brand in such event our business and reputation may suffer and as a result our revenues and stock price could decline 

as of december 30 2018 we had 793 us franchisees operating 5486 us stores seventeen of these franchisees each own and operate more than 50 us stores including our largest us franchisee who owns and operates 179 stores and the average franchisee owns and operates seven stores 

our international master franchisees are generally responsible for the development of significantly more stores than our us franchisees as a result our international operations are more closely tied to the success of a smaller number of franchisees than our us operations our largest international master franchisee operates 2383 stores in seven markets which accounts for approximately 24 of our total international store count our us and international franchisees may not operate their franchises successfully if one or more of our key franchisees were to become insolvent or otherwise were unable or unwilling to pay us our royalties or other amounts owed our business and results of operations would be adversely affected 

we may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property which could harm the value of our brand and branded products and adversely affect our business 

we depend in large part on our brand and branded products and believe that they are very important to our business we rely on a combination of trademarks copyrights trade secrets and similar intellectual property rights to protect our brand and branded products the success of our business depends on our continued ability to use our existing trademarks in order to increase brand awareness and further develop our branded products in both us and international markets we have registered certain trademarks and have other trademark applications pending in the us and foreign jurisdictions not all of the trademarks that we currently use have been registered in all of the countries in which we do business and they may never be registered in all of these countries we may not be able to adequately protect our trademarks and our use of these trademarks may result in liability for trademark infringement trademark dilution or unfair competition all of the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property in the us and in foreign countries may not be adequate in addition the laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the us further through acquisitions of third parties we may acquire brands and related trademarks that are subject to the same risks as the brands and trademarks we currently own 

we may from time to time be required to institute or defend litigation to enforce our trademarks or other intellectual property rights or to protect our trade secrets such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could negatively affect our sales profitability and prospects regardless of whether we are able to successfully enforce our rights 

 

the occurrence of cyber incidents or a deficiency in cybersecurity could negatively impact our business by causing a disruption to our operations a compromise or corruption of confidential information or damage to our employee and business relationships any of which could subject us to loss and harm our brand 

a cyber incident is considered to be any adverse event that threatens the confidentiality integrity or availability of information resources more specifically a cyber incident is an intentional attack or an unintentional event that can include gaining unauthorized access to systems to disrupt operations corrupt data or steal confidential information about customers franchisees suppliers or employees a number of retailers and other companies have recently experienced serious cyber incidents and breaches of their information technology systems as our reliance on technology has increased so have the risks posed to our systems both internal and those we have outsourced the three primary risks that could directly result from the occurrence of a cyber incident include operational interruption damage to our relationships with customers franchisees and employees and private data exposure in addition to maintaining insurance coverage to address cyber incidents we have also implemented processes procedures and controls to help mitigate these risks however our cyber insurance coverage may not fully cover the costs of a cyber incident and these measures as well as our increased awareness of the risk of a cyber incident do not guarantee that our reputation and financial results will not be adversely affected by such an incident 

because we and our franchisees accept electronic forms of payment from customers our business requires the collection and retention of customer data including sensitive financial data and other personally identifiable information in various information systems that we and our franchisees maintain and in those maintained by third parties with whom we and our franchisees contract to provide payment processing a weakness in such third party’s systems or software products may provide a mechanism for a cyber threat in recent years a significant number of companies have experienced security breaches in which customer information was stolen through vendor access channels while we select our thirdparty suppliers carefully cyber attacks and security breaches at a payment processing contractor could compromise confidential information or adversely affect our ability to deliver products and services to our customers these problems could negatively affect our results of operations and remediation could result in significant unplanned capital investments 

we also maintain important internal company data such as personally identifiable information about our employees and franchisees and information relating to our operations in addition more than half of all global retail sales in 2018 were derived from digital channels primarily through our online ordering website and mobile applications where customers enter personally identifiable information that we retain our use and retention of personally identifiable information is regulated by foreign federal and state laws and regulations as well as by certain thirdparty agreements for example the european union adopted a new regulation that became effective in may 2018 the european union general data protection regulation which requires companies to meet new requirements regarding the handling of personal data as privacy and information security laws and regulations change we may incur additional costs to ensure that we remain in compliance with those laws and regulations if our security and information systems are compromised or if we our employees or franchisees fail to comply with these laws regulations or contract terms or to successfully implement appropriate processes related to applicable requirements laws and regulations governing cyber incidents could require us to notify customers employees or other groups and could result in adverse publicity loss of sales and profits increased fees payable to third parties and penalties or remediation and other costs that could adversely affect our reputation business and results of operations any other material disruption or other adverse event affecting one or more of our digital ordering platforms including for instance power loss technological failures user error or cyber attacks could similarly result in adverse publicity loss of sales and profits and other costs which could adversely affect our reputation business and results of operations 

we may also become subject to private lawsuits or other proceedings for purportedly fraudulent transactions arising out of the actual or alleged theft of our consumers’ credit or debit card information or if consumer or employee information is obtained by unauthorized persons or used inappropriately any such claim or proceeding or any adverse publicity resulting from such an event may have a material adverse effect on our business and the potential of incurring significant remediation costs 

 

we are subject to extensive government regulation and requirements issued by other groups and our failure to comply with existing or increased regulations could adversely affect our business and operating results 

we are subject to numerous federal state local and foreign laws and regulations as well as requirements issued by other groups including those relating to 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 we are subject to a federal trade commission rule and to various state and foreign laws that govern the offer and sale of franchises these laws regulate various aspects of the franchise relationship including terminations and the refusal to renew franchises the failure to comply with these laws and regulations in any jurisdiction or to obtain required government approvals could result in a ban or temporary suspension on future franchise sales fines or other penalties or require us to make offers of rescission or restitution any of which could adversely affect our business and operating results 

in 2015 the national labor relations board adopted a new and broader standard for determining when two or more otherwise unrelated employers may be found to be a joint employer of the same employees under the national labor relations act although elements of this joint employer liability standard continue to be subject to judicial review if this standard is generally upheld or adopted by other government agencies such as the department of labor the equal employment opportunity commission and the occupational safety and health administration andor applied generally to franchise relationships it could cause us to be liable or held responsible for unfair labor practices and other violations of our franchisees and subject us to other liabilities and require us to conduct collective bargaining negotiations regarding employees of totally separate independent employers most notably our franchisees in such event our operating expenses may increase as a result of required modifications to our business practices increased litigation governmental investigations or proceedings administrative enforcement actions fines and civil liability 

the patient protection and affordable care act as amended the “affordable care act” requires employers such as us to provide health insurance for all qualifying employees or pay penalties for not providing coverage the majority of the increases in these costs began in 2015 and while the incremental costs of this program have not been material to us to date we cannot predict what effect these costs will have on our results of operations and financial position or the effects of the affordable care act on some of our larger franchisees modifications to or repeal of all or certain provisions of the affordable care act are possible consistent with statements made by certain elected officials 

the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 the “2017 tax act” was signed into law on december 22 2017 significantly reforming the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the 2017 tax act among other things includes changes to us federal tax rates imposes significant additional limitations on the deductibility of interest allows for the expensing of capital expenditures puts into effect the migration from a “worldwide” system of taxation to a territorial system and modifies or repeals many business deductions and credits we continue to examine the impact the 2017 tax act may have on our business the estimated impact of the 2017 tax act is based on our management’s current knowledge and assumptions and recognized impacts could be materially different from current estimates based on our actual results and our further analysis of the new law we revalued our net deferred tax assets and liabilities at the newly enacted corporate tax rate in fiscal 2017 and recorded a significantly lower effective tax rate in 2018 although some uncertainty remains about the effects of this new legislation on our business we currently expect lower effective tax rates for the company in 2018 will continue in future periods 

we may also become subject to legislation or regulation seeking to tax andor regulate highfat foods foods with high sugar and salt content or foods otherwise deemed to be “unhealthy” and our capital expenditures could increase due to remediation and compliance measures related to these laws or regulations 

 

if we fail to comply with existing or future laws and regulations we may be subject to governmental or judicial fines sanctions and other enforcement measures

our current insurance coverage may not be adequate insurance premiums for such coverage may increase and we may not be able to obtain insurance at acceptable rates or at all 

we have retention programs for workers’ compensation general liability and owned and nonowned automobile liabilities we are generally responsible for up to 10 million per occurrence under these retention programs for workers’ compensation and general liability we are generally responsible for between 500000 and 30 million per occurrence under these retention programs for owned and nonowned automobile liabilities total insurance limits under these retention programs vary depending upon the period covered and range up to 1100 million per occurrence for general liability and owned and nonowned automobile liabilities and up to the applicable statutory limits for workers’ compensation these insurance policies may not be adequate to protect us from liabilities that we incur in our business in addition in the future our insurance premiums may increase and we may not be able to obtain similar levels of insurance on reasonable terms or at all any such inadequacy of or inability to obtain insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our annual and quarterly financial results are subject to significant fluctuations depending on various factors many of which are beyond our control and if we fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors our share price may decline significantly 

our sales and operating results can vary significantly from quartertoquarter and yeartoyear depending on various factors many of which are beyond our control these factors include among other things 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 as a result our operational performance may decline quickly and significantly in response to changes in order patterns or rapid decreases in demand for our products we anticipate that fluctuations in operating results will continue in the future 

our common stock price could be subject to significant fluctuations andor may decline 

the market price of our common stock could be subject to significant fluctuations among the factors that could affect our stock price are 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 the stock markets in general have experienced volatility that has sometimes been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies these broad market fluctuations may cause the trading price of our common stock to decline 

 

our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our business and limit our ability to plan for or respond to changes in our business 

we have a substantial amount of indebtedness as of december 30 2018 our consolidated total indebtedness was approximately 353 billion we may also incur additional debt which would not be prohibited under the terms of our current securitized debt agreements our substantial indebtedness could have important consequences for our business and our shareholders for example it could 

 

  

  

  

 further a portion of our indebtedness bears interest at fluctuating interest rates based on the london interbank offered rate “libor” and there is currently uncertainty around whether libor will continue to exist after 2021 if libor ceases to exist we may need to renegotiate certain loan documents and we cannot predict what alternative index would be negotiated with our lenders as a result our interest expense could increase in which event we may have difficulties making interest payments and funding our other fixed costs and our available cash flow for general corporate requirements may be adversely affected 

in addition the financial and other covenants we agreed to with our lenders may limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness make investments pay dividends and engage in other transactions and the leverage may cause potential lenders to be less willing to loan funds to us in the future our failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default that if not cured or waived could result in the acceleration of repayment of all of our indebtedness 

downgrades in our credit ratings could impact our ability to access capital and materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

our debt is rated by credit rating agencies these agencies may downgrade their credit ratings for us based on the performance of our business our capital strategies or their overall view of our industry there can be no assurance that any rating assigned to our currently outstanding indebtedness will remain in effect for any given period of time or that any such ratings will not be lowered suspended or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if in that agency’s judgment circumstances so warrant a downgrade of our credit ratings could among other things increase our cost of borrowing limit our ability to access capital result in more restrictive covenants in agreements governing the terms of any future indebtedness that we may incur including restrictions on our ability to pay dividends or repurchase shares or require us to provide collateral for future borrowings and thereby adversely impact our business financial condition and results of operations 

we may be unable to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our significant debt service obligations which would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

our ability to make principal and interest payments on and to refinance our indebtedness will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future this to a certain extent is subject to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control if our business does not generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the amounts projected or at all or if future borrowings are not available to us under our variable funding notes in amounts sufficient to fund our other liquidity needs our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected if we cannot generate sufficient cash flow from operations to make scheduled principal amortization and interest payments on our debt obligations in the future we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity sell assets delay capital expenditures or seek additional equity if we are unable to refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all or to effect any other action relating to our indebtedness on satisfactory terms or at all our business may be harmed 

 

the terms of our securitized debt financing of certain of our whollyowned subsidiaries have restrictive terms and our failure to comply with any of these terms could put us in default which would have an adverse effect on our business and prospects 

unless and until we repay all outstanding borrowings under our securitized debt we will remain subject to the restrictive terms of these borrowings the securitized debt under which certain of our whollyowned subsidiaries issued and guaranteed fixed rate notes and variable funding senior revolving notes contain a number of covenants with the most significant financial covenant being a debt service coverage calculation these covenants limit the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to among other things 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 the securitized debt also requires us to maintain specified financial ratios at the end of each fiscal quarter these restrictions could affect our ability to pay dividends or repurchase shares of our common stock our ability to meet these financial ratios can be affected by events beyond our control and we may not satisfy such a test a breach of this covenant could result in a rapid amortization event or default under the securitized debt if amounts owed under the securitized debt are accelerated because of a default under the securitized debt and we are unable to pay such amounts the investors may have the right to assume control of substantially all of the securitized assets 

during the term following issuance the outstanding senior notes will accrue interest in accordance with the terms of the debt agreements additionally our senior notes have original scheduled principal payments of 353 million in each of 2019 through 2021 8880 million in 2022 263 million in each of 2023 and 2024 114 billion in 2025 140 million in 2026 and 127 billion in 2027 in accordance with our debt agreements the payment of principal on the outstanding senior notes shall be suspended if the leverage ratios for the company are less than or equal to 50x total debt as defined to adjusted ebitda as defined and no catchup provisions are applicable as of december 30 2018 we also had 650 million outstanding under our variable funding notes with a legal maturity date in july 2022 subject to two additional oneyear extensions at the option of the company subject to certain conditions 

if we are unable to refinance or repay amounts under the securitized debt prior to the expiration of the term our cash flow would be directed to the repayment of the securitized debt and other than a weekly management fee sufficient to cover minimal selling general and administrative expenses would not be available for operating our business 

no assurance can be given that any refinancing or additional financing will be possible when needed or that we will be able to negotiate acceptable terms in addition our access to capital is affected by prevailing conditions in the financial and capital markets and other factors beyond our control there can be no assurance that market conditions will be favorable at the times that we require new or additional financing 

the indenture governing the securitized debt will restrict the cash flow from the entities subject to the securitization to any of our other entities and upon the occurrence of certain events cash flow would be further restricted 

in the event that a rapid amortization event occurs under the indenture including without limitation upon an event of default under the indenture or the failure to repay the securitized debt at the end of its term the funds available to us would be reduced or eliminated which would in turn reduce our ability to operate or grow our business

 item 3 legal proceedings 

we are a party to lawsuits revenue agent reviews by taxing authorities and administrative proceedings in the ordinary course of business which include without limitation workers’ compensation general liability automobile and franchisee claims we are also subject to suits related to employment practices 

litigation is subject to many uncertainties and the outcome of individual litigated matters is not predictable with assurance these matters referenced above could be decided unfavorably to us and could require us to pay damages or make other expenditures in amounts or a range of amounts that cannot be estimated with accuracy in management’s opinion these matters individually and in the aggregate should not have a significant adverse effect on the financial condition of the company and the established accruals adequately provide for the estimated resolution of such claims

on february 14 2011 domino’s pizza llc was named as a defendant in a lawsuit along with fischler enterprises of cf inc a franchisee and jeffrey s kidd the franchisee’s delivery driver filed by yvonne wiederhold the plaintiff as personal representative of the estate of richard e wiederhold deceased the case involved a traffic accident in which the franchisee’s delivery driver is alleged to have caused an accident involving a vehicle driven by richard wiederhold mr wiederhold sustained spinal injuries resulting in quadriplegia and passed away several months after the accident the jury returned a 101 million judgment for the plaintiff where the company and mr kidd were found to be 90 liable after certain offsets and other deductions the final verdict was 89 million in the second quarter of 2016 the trial court ruled on all postjudgment motions and entered the judgment the company denies liability and in the third quarter of 2016 filed an appeal of the verdict on a variety of grounds on may 11 2018 the court of appeals reversed and remanded the case to the trial court for a new trial based on the plaintiff’s improper closing argument the company continues to deny liability in this matter 

while we may occasionally be party to large claims including class action suits we do not believe that any existing matters individually or in the aggregate will materially affect our financial position results of operations or cash flows

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of these financial statements requires our management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis our management evaluates its estimates including those related to revenue recognition longlived and intangible assets insurance and legal matters sharebased payments and income taxes we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from those estimates changes in our accounting policies and estimates could materially impact our results of operations and financial condition for any particular period we believe that our most critical accounting policies and estimates are 

revenue recognition  we earn revenues through our network of us companyowned and franchised stores dough manufacturing and supply chain centers and international operations retail sales from franchise stores are reported to the company by its franchisees and are not included in company revenues retail sales from companyowned stores and royalty revenues resulting from the retail sales from franchised stores are recognized as revenues when the items are delivered to or carried out by customers retail sales are generally reported and related royalties paid to the company based on a percentage of retail sales as specified in the related standard franchise agreement generally 55 of us franchise retail sales and on average 30 of international franchise retail sales the company also generates revenues from us franchise advertising contributions to dnaf its consolidated notforprofit advertising fund generally 60 of us franchise retail sales although these revenues are restricted to be used only for advertising and promotional activities to benefit franchised stores the company has determined there are not performance obligations associated with the franchise advertising contributions received by dnaf that are separate from its us royalty payment stream and as a result these franchise contributions and the related expenses are presented gross in the company’s consolidated statement of income 

revenues from companyowned stores and revenues from franchised stores including us franchise royalties and fees and us franchise advertising revenues can fluctuate from timetotime as a result of store count and sales level changes this can occur when a companyowned store is sold to a franchisee if a companyowned store that generated 1000000 in revenue in fiscal 2017 was sold to a franchisee in fiscal 2018 revenues from companyowned stores would have declined by 1000000 in fiscal 2018 while us franchise royalty revenues would have increased by 55000 and us franchise advertising revenues would have increased by 60000 in fiscal 2018 as we generally collect 55 of a us franchisee’s retail sales as royalty revenue and 60 of a us franchisee’s retail sales for advertising contributions sales of food from our supply chain centers are recognized as revenues upon delivery of the food to franchisees while sales of equipment and supplies are generally recognized as revenues upon shipment of the related products to franchisees 

 

longlived and intangible assets we record longlived assets including property plant and equipment and capitalized software at cost for acquisitions of franchise operations we estimate the fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired based on physical inspection of assets historical experience and other information available to us regarding the acquisition we depreciate and amortize longlived assets using useful lives determined by us based on historical experience and other information available to us we evaluate the potential impairment of longlived assets at least annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable our evaluation is based on various analyses including the projection of undiscounted cash flows for companyowned stores we perform related impairment tests on an operating market basis which the company has determined to be the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of other cash flows if the carrying amount of a longlived asset exceeds the amount of the expected future undiscounted cash flows of that asset the company estimates the fair value of the asset if the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset an impairment loss is recognized and the asset is written down to its estimated fair value 

we have not made any significant changes in the methodology used to project the future market cash flows of companyowned stores during the years presented same store sales fluctuations and the rates at which operating costs will fluctuate in the future are key factors in evaluating recoverability of the related assets if our same store sales significantly decline or if operating costs increase and we are unable to recover these costs the carrying value of our companyowned stores by market may be unrecoverable and we may be required to recognize an impairment charge 

a significant portion of our goodwill relates to acquisitions of us franchise stores and is included in our us stores segment specifically in our companyowned stores division we evaluate goodwill annually for impairment by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit which is primarily determined using the present value of future cash flows to its carrying value if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value goodwill would be impaired we have not made any significant changes in the methodology used to evaluate goodwill impairment during the years presented at december 30 2018 the fair value of our business operations with associated goodwill exceeded their recorded carrying value including the related goodwill if cash flows generated by our companyowned stores were to decline significantly in the future or there were negative revisions to the market multiple assumption we may be required to recognize a goodwill impairment charge however based on the latest impairment analysis we do not believe it is reasonably likely that there could be changes in assumptions that would trigger impairment the company did not record any impairment charges during fiscal 2018 fiscal 2017 or fiscal 2016 

we adopted asu 201704 intangibles – goodwill and other topic 350 simplifying the test for goodwill impairment “asu 201704” during 2018 asu 201704 simplifies the subsequent measurement of goodwill by eliminating “step 2” from the goodwill impairment test as the fair value of our business operations exceeded their recorded carrying value in “step 1” of the impairment test the adoption of this standard did not have an impact on our evaluation of goodwill impairment 

insurance and legal matters we are a party to lawsuits and legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business management closely monitors these legal matters and estimates the probable costs for the resolution of such matters these estimates are primarily determined by consulting with both internal and external parties handling the matters and are based upon an analysis of potential results assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies legal judgments can be volatile and difficult to predict accordingly if our estimates relating to legal matters proved inaccurate for any reason we may be required to increase or decrease the related expense in future periods we had accruals for legal matters of approximately 19 million at december 30 2018 and 17 million at december 31 2017 

for certain periods prior to december 1998 and for periods after december 2001 we maintain insurance coverage for workers’ compensation general liability and owned and nonowned auto liability under insurance policies requiring payment of a deductible for each occurrence up to between 500000 and 30 million depending on the policy year and line of coverage the related insurance reserves are based on undiscounted independent actuarial estimates which are based on historical information along with assumptions about future events specifically various methods including analyses of historical trends and actuarial valuation methods are utilized to estimate the cost to settle reported claims and claims incurred but not yet reported the actuarial valuation methods develop estimates of the future ultimate claim costs based on the claims incurred as of the balance sheet date when estimating these liabilities several factors are considered including the severity duration and frequency of claims legal cost associated with claims healthcare trends and projected inflation 

 

our methodology for determining our exposure has remained consistent throughout the years presented management believes that the various assumptions developed and actuarial methods used to determine our selfinsurance reserves are reasonable and provide meaningful data that management uses to make its best estimate of our exposure to these risks changes in assumptions for such factors as medical costs and legal actions as well as changes in actual experience could cause our estimates to change in the near term which could result in an increase or decrease in the related expense in future periods a 10 change in our selfinsurance liability at december 30 2018 would have affected our income before provision for income taxes by approximately 53 million for fiscal 2018 we had accruals for insurance matters of approximately 533 million at december 30 2018 and 514 million at december 31 2017 

sharebased payments we recognize compensation expense related to our sharebased compensation arrangements over the requisite service period based on the grant date fair value of the awards the grant date fair value of each restricted stock and performancebased restricted stock award is equal to the market price of our stock on the date of grant the grant date fair value of each stock option award is estimated using the blackscholes option pricing model the pricing model requires assumptions including the expected life of the stock option the riskfree interest rate the expected dividend yield and expected volatility of our stock over the expected life which significantly impact the assumed fair value we account for forfeitures as they occur additionally our stock option restricted stock and performancebased restricted stock arrangements provide for accelerated vesting and the ability to exercise during the remainder of the tenyear stock option life upon the retirement of individuals holding the awards who have achieved specified service and age requirements 

management believes that the methods and various assumptions used to determine compensation expense related to these arrangements are reasonable but if the assumptions change significantly for future grants sharebased compensation expense will fluctuate in future years 

income taxes we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities we measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using current enacted tax rates that will apply in the years in which we expect the temporary differences to be recovered or paid judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes related reserves and deferred tax assets and liabilities these include establishing a valuation allowance related to the ability to realize certain deferred tax assets if necessary on an ongoing basis management will assess whether it remains more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets will be realized the company did not have any valuation allowances recorded for deferred tax assets as of december 30 2018 or december 31 2017 our accounting for deferred tax assets represents our best estimate of future events our net deferred tax assets assume that we will generate sufficient taxable income in specific tax jurisdictions based on our estimates and assumptions changes in our current estimates due to unanticipated events could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

the amounts recorded on the balance sheet relating to uncertain tax positions consider the ultimate resolution of revenue agent reviews based on estimates and assumptions we believe we have appropriately accounted for our uncertain tax positions however tax audits changes in tax laws and other unforeseen matters may result in us owing additional taxes we adjust our reserves for uncertain tax positions when facts and circumstances change or due to the passage of time the completion of a tax audit or the expiration of a statute of limitations associated with uncertain tax positions are examples of situations when we may adjust our reserves management believes that our tax positions comply with applicable tax law and that we have adequately provided for these matters however to the extent the final tax outcome of these matters is different than our recorded amounts we may be required to adjust our tax reserves resulting in additional income tax expense or benefit in future periods

liquidity and capital resources 

historically we have operated with minimal positive working capital or negative working capital primarily because our receivable collection periods and inventory turn rates are faster than the normal payment terms on our current liabilities we generally collect our receivables within three weeks from the date of the related sale and we generally experience 35 to 45 inventory turns per year in addition our sales are not typically seasonal which further limits our working capital requirements these factors coupled with the use of our ongoing cash flows from operations to service our debt obligations invest in our business pay dividends and repurchase our common stock reduce our working capital amounts as of december 30 2018 we had working capital of 146 million excluding restricted cash and cash equivalents of 1670 million advertising fund assets restricted of 1127 million and advertising fund liabilities of 1072 million working capital includes total unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of 254 million 

 

as of december 30 2018 we had approximately 1303 million of restricted cash held for future principal and interest payments 365 million of restricted cash held in a threemonth interest reserve as required by the related debt agreements and 02 million of other restricted cash for a total of 1670 million of restricted cash and cash equivalents as of december 30 2018 we also held 450 million of advertising fund restricted cash and cash equivalents which can only be used for activities that promote the domino’s pizza brand 

our primary source of liquidity is cash flows from operations and availability of borrowings under our variable funding notes in connection with the 2017 recapitalization the company issued a variable funding note facility which allows for advances of up to 1750 million of series 20171 variable funding senior secured notes class a1 notes and certain other credit instruments including letters of credit the “2017 variable funding notes” as of december 30 2018 we had 650 million of outstanding borrowings and 619 million of available borrowing capacity under our 2017 variable funding notes net of letters of credit issued of 481 million the letters of credit are primarily related to our casualty insurance programs and certain supply chain center leases borrowings under the 2017 variable funding notes are available to fund our working capital requirements capital expenditures and subject to other limitations other general corporate purposes including dividend payments and share repurchases 

2018 recapitalization 

on april 24 2018 we completed the 2018 recapitalization in which certain of our subsidiaries issued new notes pursuant to an assetbacked securitization the notes consisted of 4250 million series 20181 4116 fixed rate senior secured notes class a2i with an anticipated term of 75 years the “2018 75year fixed rate notes” and 4000 million series 20181 4328 fixed rate senior secured notes class a2ii with an anticipated term of 925 years the “2018 925year fixed rate notes” and collectively with the 2018 75year fixed rate notes the “2018 notes” in an offering exempt from registration under the securities act of 1933 as amended gross proceeds from the issuance of the 2018 notes were 8250 million additional information related to the 2018 recapitalization transaction is included in note 4 to our consolidated financial statements

 operating activities 

cash provided by operating activities increased 529 million in 2018 primarily due to an increase in net income of 841 million this increase was partially offset by the negative impact of changes in operating assets and liabilities of 321 million our cash outflows for operating assets and liabilities in 2018 were higher than in 2017 due primarily to higher inventory balances and the timing of payments on accounts payable and accrued liabilities 

cash provided by operating activities increased 488 million in 2017 from 2016 primarily due to an increase in net income of 632 million net income in 2017 included a 272 million benefit from the adoption of asu 201609 which requires tax benefits on equitybased compensation to be recorded as a reduction to the provision from income taxes in net income and as a component of cash provided by operating activities in 2016 these tax benefits were recorded directly to stockholders’ deficit and as a financing activity in the statement of cash flows cash provided by operating activities was also positively impacted by an increase in noncash amounts of 181 million these increases were offset in part by the negative impact of changes in operating assets and liabilities of 325 million primarily related to the timing of payments on accounts payable and accrued liabilities during 2017 as compared to 2016

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk 

we do not engage in speculative transactions nor do we hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes in connection with the 2017 recapitalization we issued fixed and floating rate notes and at december 30 2018 we are exposed to interest rate risk on borrowings under our 2017 floating rate notes and our 2017 variable funding notes as of december 30 2018 we had 650 million in outstanding borrowings under our 2017 variable funding notes our 2017 floating rate notes and our 2017 variable funding notes bear interest at fluctuating interest rates based on libor a hypothetical 10 adverse change in the libor rate would have resulted in higher interest expense of approximately 30 million in 2018 

there is currently uncertainty around whether libor will continue to exist after 2021 if libor ceases to exist we may need to renegotiate our loan documents and we cannot predict what alternative index would be negotiated with our lenders as a result our interest expense could increase in which event we may have difficulties making interest payments and funding our other fixed costs and our available cash flow for general corporate requirements may be adversely affected 

our fixed rate debt exposes the company to changes in market interest rates reflected in the fair value of the debt and to the risk that the company may need to refinance maturing debt with new debt at a higher rate 

we are exposed to market risks from changes in commodity prices during the normal course of business we purchase cheese and certain other food products that are affected by changes in commodity prices and as a result we are subject to volatility in our food costs we may periodically enter into financial instruments to manage this risk we do not engage in speculative transactions nor do we hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes in instances when we use fixed pricing agreements with our suppliers these agreements cover our physical commodity needs are not netsettled and are accounted for as normal purchases 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

we have exposure to various foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations for revenues generated by our operations outside the us which can adversely impact our net income and cash flows approximately 65 of our total revenues in 2018 74 of our total revenues in 2017 and 72 of our total revenues in 2016 were derived from our international franchise segment a majority of which were denominated in foreign currencies we also operate dough manufacturing and distribution facilities in canada which generate revenues denominated in canadian dollars we do not enter into financial instruments to manage this foreign currency exchange risk a hypothetical 10 adverse change in the foreign currency rates for our international markets would have resulted in a negative impact on royalty revenues of approximately 200 million in 2018

 item 1 business tableend overview 

domino’s is the largest pizza company in the world based on global retail sales with more than 14800 locations in over 85 markets around the world founded in 1960 our roots are in convenient pizza delivery while a significant amount of our sales also come from carryout customers although we are a highlyrecognized global brand we focus on serving the local neighborhoods in which we live and do business through our large network of franchise owners and companyowned stores on average we and our franchisees sell more than 25 million pizzas each day throughout our global system 

our business model is straightforward we handcraft and serve quality food at a competitive price with easy ordering access and efficient service enhanced by our technology innovations our dough is generally made fresh and distributed to stores around the world by us and our franchisees 

domino’s generates revenues and earnings by charging royalties and fees to our franchisees royalties are ongoing percentofsales fees for use of the domino’s ® brand marks the company also generates revenues and earnings by selling food equipment and supplies to franchisees primarily in the us and canada and by operating a number of our own stores franchisees profit by selling pizza and other complementary items to their local customers in our international markets we generally grant geographical rights to the domino’s pizza ® brand to master franchisees these master franchisees are charged with developing their geographical area and they may profit by subfranchising and selling food and equipment to those subfranchisees as well as by running pizza stores everyone in the system can benefit including the end consumer who can feed domino’s menu items to their family conveniently and economically 

our business model can yield strong returns for our franchise owners and companyowned stores it can also yield significant cash flow to us through a consistent franchise royalty payment and supply chain revenue stream with moderate capital expenditures we have historically returned cash to shareholders through dividend payments and share repurchases since becoming a publiclytraded company

our history 

we pioneered the pizza delivery business and built domino’s pizza into one of the most widelyrecognized consumer brands in the world we have been delivering quality affordable food to our customers since 1960 when brothers thomas and james monaghan borrowed 900 to purchase a small pizza store in ypsilanti michigan thomas purchased his brother’s share of the business shortly thereafter concentrating first on building stores near college campuses and military bases in the 1960s and 1970s the brand grew quickly in the 1980s in urban markets and near residential communities we became “domino’s pizza” in 1965 and opened our first franchised store in 1967 the first international stores opened in 1983 in canada and australia 

monaghan sold 93 of his economic stake in the company in 1998 to bain capital llc then sold and transferred his remaining stake in the company in 2004 when we completed our initial public offering 

since 1998 the company has been structured with a leveraged balance sheet and has completed a number of recapitalization events the company’s most recent recapitalization transaction in 2017 the “2017 recapitalization” primarily consisted of the issuance of 19 billion of fixed and floating rate notes and the repurchase and retirement of 9102 million of previously outstanding fixed rate notes following the 2017 recapitalization and including debt from its previous recapitalization in 2015 the “2015 recapitalization” the company had 315 billion in total debt excess proceeds from both our 2015 and 2017 recapitalizations were primarily used to repurchase shares of our common stock 

we relaunched our brand in the us in late 2009 by introducing a new recipe for our core pizza product since 2008 the majority of our menu has changed either through the improvement of existing products or the introduction of new products such as our handmade pan pizza and specialty chicken during this time frame we also began expanding our focus on technology through our development of innovative ordering platforms and other technological advancements such as the launch of our piece of the pie rewards ® loyalty program in 2015 globally we opened our 10000 th store in 2012 and our 14000 th store in 2017 in 2013 we announced a plan requiring all stores to adopt our new carryout friendly “pizza theater” store design which is more inviting to customers and allows them to see their orders being made fresh in front of them the majority of our domestic and international stores have completed these remodels as of the end of 2017 

 

our industry 

the us qsr pizza category is large and fragmented from 2007 through 2017 the us qsr pizza category has grown from 329 billion to 360 billion it is the secondlargest category within the 2902 billion us qsr sector the us qsr pizza category is primarily comprised of delivery dinein and carryout 

in the us we compete primarily in the delivery and carryout segments of the pizza industry we are the market share leader in the delivery segment and we are amongst the top three chains in share in the carryout segment delivery segment sales of 98 billion in 2017 down from 109 billion in 2007 account for approximately 27 of total us qsr pizza the delivery segment declined during the period from 2007 to 2012 and has increased slightly since 2012 from 97 billion in 2012 to 98 billion in 2017 the three industry leaders including domino’s account for over 56 of us pizza delivery based on reported consumer spending with the remaining sales going to regional chains and independent establishments from 2007 to 2017 the carryout segment grew from 135 billion to 167 billion the four industry leaders including domino’s account for approximately 48 of the carryout segment 

in contrast to the us international pizza delivery is relatively underdeveloped with only domino’s and two other competitors having a significant global presence we believe that demand for pizza and pizza delivery is large and growing throughout the world driven by international consumers’ increasing emphasis on convenience and the proven success of our 35 years of conducting business abroad 

our competition 

the global pizza delivery and carryout segments are highly competitive in the us we compete against regional and local companies as well as national chains pizza hut ®  papa john’s ® and little caesars pizza ®  internationally we compete primarily with pizza hut ®  papa john’s ® and countryspecific national and local pizzerias we generally compete on the basis of product quality location image service technology convenience and price our business and those of our competitors can be affected by changes in consumer tastes economic conditions demographic trends and consumers’ disposable income we also compete on a broader scale with other food and food delivery companies we compete not only for customers but also for employees suitable real estate sites and qualified franchisees 

our customers 

the company’s business is not dependent upon a single retail customer or small group of customers including franchisees no customer accounted for more than 10 of total consolidated revenues in 2017 2016 or 2015 our largest franchisee based on store count domino’s pizza enterprises dmp asx operates 2170 stores in seven international markets and accounts for 15 of our total store count revenues from this master franchisee accounted for 15 of our consolidated revenues in 2017 our international business unit only requires a minimal amount of general and administrative expenses to support its markets and does not have costs of sales therefore the vast majority of these royalty revenues result in profits to us 

our menu 

we offer a menu designed to present an attractive quality offering to customers while keeping it simple enough to minimize order errors and expedite ordertaking and food preparation our basic menu features pizza products with varying sizes and crust types our typical store also offers ovenbaked sandwiches pasta boneless chicken and wings bread side items desserts and soft drink products international markets vary toppings by country and culture such as squid topping in japan or spicy cheese in india and often feature regional specialty items such as a banana and cinnamon dessert pizza in brazil 

store image and operations 

we have been focused primarily on pizza delivery for over 55 years as well as carryout as a significant component of our business in 2012 we introduced our carryoutfriendly pizza theater store design the majority of our domestic and international stores have converted to this design as of the end of 2017 many stores offer casual seating and enable customers to watch the preparation of their orders but do not offer a fullservice dinein experience as a result our stores generally do not require expensive restaurant facilities and staffing 

research and development 

we conduct research and product development at our world resource center our corporate headquarters in ann arbor michigan companysponsored research and development activities which include testing new products for possible menu additions are an important activity for us and our franchisees we do not consider the amounts spent on research and development to be material 

 

our business segments 

we operate and report three business segments domestic stores international franchise and supply chain 

domestic stores 

our domestic stores segment consists primarily of our franchise operations which consist of 5195 franchised stores located in the contiguous united states we also operate a network of 392 domestic companyowned stores located in the contiguous united states 

during 2017 our domestic stores segment accounted for 8422 million or over 30 of our consolidated revenues we use our companyowned stores as test sites for new products and promotions as well as operational improvements we also use them for training new store managers and operations team members as well as developing prospective franchisees while we are primarily a franchised business we continuously evaluate our mix of domestic companyowned and franchise stores 

we maintain a productive relationship with our independent franchise owners through regional franchise teams distributing materials that help franchise stores comply with our standards and using franchise advisory groups that facilitate communications between us and our franchisees 

domestic franchise profile 

as of december 31 2017 our network of 5195 domestic franchise stores were owned and operated by 789 independent domestic franchisees our franchise formula enables franchisees to benefit from our brand name with a relatively low initial capital investment as of december 31 2017 the average domestic franchisee owned and operated seven stores and had been in our franchise system for over 18 years at the same time 14 of our domestic franchisees operated more than 50 stores including our largest domestic franchisee who operated 187 stores and 271 of our domestic franchisees each operated one store 

we apply rigorous standards to prospective domestic franchisees we generally require them to manage a store for at least one year before being granted a franchise this enables us to observe the operational and financial performance of a potential franchisee prior to entering into a longterm contract significantly all of our 789 independent domestic franchise owners started their careers with us as delivery drivers or in other instore positions which we believe offers advantages in terms of familiarity with our business and store operations in addition we generally restrict the ability of domestic franchisees to be involved in other businesses which we believe helps focus our franchisees’ attention on operating their stores we believe these characteristics and standards are largely unique within the franchise industry and have resulted in qualified and focused franchisees operating domino’s stores 

domestic franchise agreements 

we enter into franchise agreements with domestic franchisees under which the franchisee is generally granted the right to operate a store in a particular location for a term of ten years with an ability to renew for an additional term of ten years we have a franchise contract renewal rate of approximately 99 under the current standard franchise agreement we assign an exclusive area of primary responsibility to each franchised store each franchisee is generally required to pay a 55 royalty fee on sales in certain instances we will collect lower rates based on area development agreements sales initiatives and new store incentives 

our domestic stores currently contribute 6 of their sales to fund national marketing and advertising campaigns subject in limited instances to lower rates based on certain incentives and waivers these funds are administered by domino’s national advertising fund inc “dnaf” our notforprofit advertising subsidiary the funds are primarily used to purchase media for advertising but also support market research field communications public relations commercial production talent payments and other activities to promote the brand in addition to the national and marketlevel advertising contributions domestic stores spend additional funds on local store marketing activities 

we have the contractual right subject to state law to terminate a franchise agreement for a variety of reasons including but not limited to a franchisee’s failure to adhere to the company’s franchise agreement failure to make required payments or failure to adhere to specified company policies and standards 

 

international franchise 

our international franchise segment is comprised of a network of franchised stores in more than 85 international markets at december 31 2017 we had 9269 international franchise stores during 2017 this segment accounted for 2067 million or over 7 of our consolidated revenues the principal sources of revenues from those operations are royalty payments generated by retail sales from franchised stores 

our international franchisees employ our basic standard operating model and adapt it to satisfy the local eating habits and consumer preferences of various regions outside the united states currently the vast majority of our international stores operate under master franchise agreements 

we believe domino’s appeals to potential international franchisees because of our recognized brand name and technological leadership the moderate capital expenditures required to open and operate our stores and our system’s favorable store economics our top five international markets in terms of store count are master franchise companies which are publicly traded on stock exchanges in australia dmpasx india jublfood ns mexico alsea mx turkey dpeu l and the united kingdom dom l the following table shows our store count as of december 31 2017 in our top ten international markets which accounted for approximately 66 of our international stores as of december 31 2017 

 

 international franchisee profile 

the vast majority of our markets outside of the contiguous united states are operated by master franchisees with franchise and distribution rights for entire regions or countries in a few select markets we franchise directly to individual store operators prospective master franchisees are required to possess local market knowledge to establish and develop domino’s pizza stores with the ability to identify and access targeted real estate sites as well as expertise in local laws customs culture and consumer behavior we also seek candidates that have access to sufficient capital to meet growth and development plans 

master franchise agreements 

our master franchise agreements generally grant the franchisee exclusive rights to develop and subfranchise stores and the right to operate supply chain centers in particular geographic areas agreements are generally for a term of ten to 20 years with options to renew for additional terms the agreements typically contain growth clauses requiring franchisees to open a minimum number of stores within a specified period the master franchisee is generally required to pay an initial onetime franchise fee as well as an additional franchise fee upon the opening of each new store the master franchisee is also required to pay a continuing royalty fee as a percentage of sales which varies among international markets and averaged approximately 30 in 2017 

supply chain 

our supply chain segment operates 18 regional dough manufacturing and food supply chain centers in the us one thin crust manufacturing center one vegetable processing center and one center providing equipment and supplies to certain of our domestic and international stores an additional regional dough manufacturing and food supply chain center is expected to open in fiscal 2018 we also operate five dough manufacturing and food supply chain centers in canada our supply chain segment leases a fleet of more than 600 tractors and trailers during 2017 our supply chain segment accounted for 174 billion or nearly 63 of our consolidated revenues 

our centers produce fresh dough and purchase receive store and deliver quality food and other complementary items to over 99 of our us and canadian franchised stores and all of our companyowned stores we regularly supply over 6000 stores with various food and supplies our supply chain segment made approximately 699000 fullservice deliveries in 2017 or approximately two deliveries per store per week and we produced over 525 million pounds of dough during 2017 

 

we believe our franchisees voluntarily choose to obtain food supplies and equipment from us because we offer the most efficient convenient and costeffective alternative while also offering both quality and consistency our supply chain segment offers profitsharing arrangements to franchisees who purchase all of their food for their stores from our centers these profitsharing arrangements generally offer participating franchisees and companyowned stores with 50 or a higher percentage in the case of companyowned stores and certain franchisees who operate a larger number of stores of their regional supply chain center’s pretax profits we believe these arrangements strengthen our ties and provide aligned benefits with franchisees 

thirdparty suppliers 

over half of our annual food spend is with suppliers where we have maintained a partnership of at least 20 years our supply partners are required to meet strict quality standards to ensure food safety we review and evaluate these partners’ quality assurance programs through among other actions onsite visits thirdparty audits and product evaluations to ensure compliance with our standards we believe the length and quality of our relationships with thirdparty suppliers provides us with priority service and quality products at competitive prices 

cheese is our largest food cost the price we charge to our domestic franchisees for cheese is based on the chicago mercantile exchange cheddar block price plus a supply chain markup as cheese prices fluctuate our revenues and margin percentages in our supply chain segment also fluctuate however actual supply chain dollar margins remain unchanged we currently purchase our domestic pizza cheese from a single supplier under the september 2017 agreement our domestic supplier agreed to provide an uninterrupted supply of cheese and the company agreed to a sevenyear pricing schedule to purchase all of its domestic pizza cheese from this supplier while we expect to meet the terms of this agreement if we do not we will be required to repay the certain negotiated cost savings as outlined in the agreement the majority of our meat toppings in the us come from a single supplier under an extension of a previous agreement we are currently in negotiations for a longerterm contract that would extend through june 2022 we have the right to terminate these arrangements for quality failures and for uncured breaches 

we are party to a multiyear agreement with cocacola ® for the contiguous united states this contract renegotiated in december 2013 provides for cocacola to continue to be our exclusive beverage supplier and expires on december 31 2018 or at such time as a minimum number of cases of cocacola products are purchased by us whichever occurs later 

we believe alternative thirdparty suppliers are available for all of these referenced products while we may incur additional costs if we are required to replace any of our supply partners we do not believe such additional costs would have a material adverse effect on our business we continually evaluate each supply category to determine the optimal sourcing strategy 

we have not experienced any significant shortages of supplies or delays in receiving our inventories or products prices charged to us by our supply partners are subject to fluctuation and we have historically been able to pass increased costs and savings on to stores we periodically enter into supplier contracts to manage the risk from changes in commodity prices we do not engage in speculative transactions nor do we hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes 

our strengths 

strong brand equity 

we are the largest pizza company in the world based on global retail sales we believe our domino’s pizza brand is one of the most widelyrecognized consumer brands in the world we are the recognized world leader in pizza delivery and have a significant business in carryout we believe consumers associate our brand with the timely delivery of quality affordable food 

over the past five years our us franchise and companyowned stores have invested an estimated 18 billion in national cooperative and local advertising our international franchisees also invest significant amounts in advertising efforts in their markets we continue to reinforce our brand with extensive advertising through various media channels we have also enhanced the strength of our brand through marketing affiliations with brands such as cocacola 

we are the number one pizza delivery company in the united states with a 290 share of pizza delivery based on reported consumer spending with 5587 stores located in the contiguous united states our store delivery areas cover a majority of us households our share position and scale allow us to leverage our purchasing power supply chain strength and marketing investments we believe our scale and market coverage allow us to effectively serve our customers’ demands for convenience and timely delivery outside the us we have significant market share positions in many of the markets in which we compete 

 

strong and proven business model 

our business model is comprised of domestic and international franchise royalties and fees revenue from supply chain and revenue from retail sales at companyowned stores we have developed this model over our many years of operation and it is anchored by strong storelevel economics which provide an entrepreneurial incentive for our franchisees and historically has generated demand for new stores our franchise system in turn has produced strong and consistent earnings for us through royalty payments and through supply chain revenues with moderate capital expenditures by us 

we developed a costefficient store model characterized by a delivery and carryoutoriented store design with moderate capital requirements and a menu of quality affordable items at the store level we believe the simplicity and efficiency of our operations give us significant advantages over our competitors who in many cases also focus on dinein or have broader menu offerings at the supply chain level we believe we provide quality and consistency for our franchise customers while also driving profits for us which we share with our franchisees 

our menu simplifies and streamlines production and delivery processes and maximizes economies of scale on purchases of our principal food items in addition our stores are generally smaller and less expensive to build furnish and maintain as compared to many other restaurant concepts new stores built in our pizza theater design may be slightly larger than stores we have built in the past to create a better experience for our carryout and dinein customers however they are still generally smaller and less expensive than many other restaurant concepts the combination of this efficient store model and strong sales volume has resulted in strong storelevel financial returns and we believe makes domino’s pizza an attractive business opportunity for existing and prospective franchisees around the world 

we believe our store economics have led to a strong welldiversified franchise system this established franchise system has produced strong cash flow and earnings for us enabling us to invest in the domino’s pizza brand stores technology and supply chain centers pay significant dividends repurchase and retire shares of our common stock and service our debt obligations 

technological innovation 

technological innovation is vital to our brand and our longterm success digital ordering is critical to competing in the global pizza industry in 2017 more than half of all global retail sales were derived from digital channels primarily through our online ordering website and mobile applications we believe we are among the largest ecommerce retailers in terms of annual transactions after launching digital ordering domestically in 2008 we made the strategic decision in 2010 to develop our own online ordering platform and to manage this important and growing area of our business internally over the next five years we launched mobile applications that cover 95 of the smartphones and tablets on the us market in 2013 we launched an enhanced online ordering profiles platform allowing customers the ability to reorder their favorite order in as few as five clicks or 30 seconds in 2014 we introduced “dom” a voice ordering application which we believe is the first in the restaurant industry and we also made the domino’s tracker ® available on our ordering platforms in 2015 we introduced several innovative ordering platforms including samsung smart tv ®  twitter and text message using a pizza emoji we continued this trend of innovation in 2016 with the introduction of zeroclick ordering as well as adding google home facebook messenger apple watch and amazon echo to our ordering platforms in 2017 as part of an industryfirst collaboration with ford motor company domino’s began a meaningful test of delivery using selfdriving vehicles 

during 2015 the company also launched its piece of the pie rewards loyalty program which is meant to reward customers with a program that is simple to understand and easy to use upon signing up for the program customers become rewards members and can earn points for online orders when rewards members reach a certain amount of points they can redeem their points for free pizza rewards members may also receive exclusive membersonly discounts and bonus offers we may also occasionally provide additional opportunities for participating customers to benefit under the piece of the pie rewards program 

all of this improved functionality has been developed to work seamlessly with our domino’s pulse ™ pointofsale system our domino’s pulse system is designed to drive operating efficiencies for our franchisees and our corporate management and assist franchisees in independently managing their business we have installed domino’s pulse in every companyowned store in the us in more than 99 of our domestic franchised stores and in over 71 of our international stores 

we believe utilizing domino’s pulse with our integrated technology solutions throughout our system provides us with competitive advantages over other concepts we intend to continue to enhance and grow our online ordering digital marketing and technological capabilities 

 

product innovation 

in late 2009 we reintroduced our core pizza in the us with a new recipe which we believe has contributed to continued growth in customer reorder rate consumer traffic and increased sales this recipe is now in use in the vast majority of markets around the world our more than 55 years of innovation have resulted in numerous new product developments including our more recent innovations of handmade pan pizza specialty chicken parmesan bread bites stuffed cheesy bread marbled cookie brownie and bread twists among others product innovation is also present in our global markets where our master franchisees have the ability to recommend products to suit their local market tastes products include the mayo jaga in japan bacon potatoes and sweet mayonnaise and the saumoneta in france light cream potatoes onions smoked salmon and dill 

internal dough manufacturing and supply chain system 

in addition to generating significant revenues and earnings in the united states and canada we believe our vertically integrated dough manufacturing and supply chain system enhances the quality and consistency of our products enhances our relationships with franchisees and leverages economies of scale to offer lower costs to our stores it also allows store managers to better focus on store operations and customer service by relieving them of the responsibility of mixing dough in the stores and sourcing other ingredients many of our international master franchisees also profit from running supply chain businesses 

our ideals 

we believe in opportunity hard work inspired solutions winning together embracing community and uncommon honesty 

opportunity abounds at domino’s you can start in an entrylevel position and become a store owner – in fact significantly all of our independent domestic franchise owners started their careers with us as delivery drivers or in other instore positions thousands of other team members – supervisors trainers quality auditors international business consultants marketers and executives – also began their careers in the stores internal growth and providing opportunities for anyone willing to work hard is the foundation of our core beliefs 

the ideals of inspired solutions uncommon honesty and winning together were driving forces behind the relaunch of our brand we were inspired by our harshest critics when it came to the perceived taste of our pizza our solution was not simply more advertising the solution was to create a new recipe and a broader menu of greattasting products our marketing campaign was shockingly honest in its approach telling consumers and showing them via television ads that we heard their negative feedback and were listening and without the buyin from our franchise owners we couldn’t have done it we believe that we can’t focus solely on the company’s success we must focus on making our stores and our franchisees successful that’s winning together

 item 1a risk factors tableend the quick service restaurant pizza category is highly competitive and such competition could adversely affect our operating results 

in the us we compete against regional and local companies as well as national chains pizza hut ®  papa john’s ® and little caesars pizza ®  internationally we compete primarily with pizza hut ®  papa john’s ® and countryspecific national and local pizzerias we could experience increased competition from existing or new companies in the pizza category which could create increasing pressures to grow our business in order to maintain our market share if we are unable to maintain our competitive position we could experience downward pressure on prices lower demand for our products reduced margins the inability to take advantage of new business opportunities and the loss of market share all of which would have an adverse effect on our operating results and could cause our stock price to decline 

we also compete on a broader scale with quick service and other international national regional and local restaurants competition from delivery aggregators and other food delivery services has also increased in recent years the overall food service market and the quick service restaurant sector are intensely competitive with respect to food quality price service image convenience and concept and are often affected by changes in 

 

  

  

  

  

 we compete within the food service market and the quick service restaurant sector not only for customers but also for management and hourly employees including drivers suitable real estate sites and qualified franchisees our supply chain segment is also subject to competition from outside suppliers while all domestic franchisees purchased food equipment and supplies from us in 2017 domestic franchisees are not required to purchase food equipment or supplies from us and they may choose to purchase from outside suppliers if other suppliers who meet our qualification standards were to offer lower prices or better service to our franchisees for their ingredients and supplies and as a result our franchisees chose not to purchase from our domestic supply chain centers our financial condition business and results of operations would be adversely affected 

if we fail to successfully implement our growth strategy which includes opening new domestic and international stores our ability to increase our revenues and operating profits could be adversely affected 

a significant component of our growth strategy includes the opening of new domestic and international stores we and our franchisees face many challenges in opening new stores including among others 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 the opening of additional franchise stores also depends in part upon the availability of prospective franchisees who meet our criteria our failure to add a significant number of new stores would adversely affect our ability to increase revenues and operating income additionally our growth strategy and the success of new stores depend in large part on the availability of suitable store sites if we and our franchisees are not able to secure leases in desired locations on favorable terms or to renew such leases our business and results of operations may be adversely affected 

we and our franchisees are currently planning to expand our domestic and international operations in many of the markets where we currently operate and in select new markets this may require considerable management time as well as startup expenses for market development before any significant revenues and earnings are generated operations in new foreign markets may achieve low margins or may be unprofitable and expansion in existing markets may be affected by local economic and market conditions therefore as we expand internationally we or our franchisees may not experience the operating margins we expect our results of operations may be negatively impacted and our common stock price may decline 

we may also pursue strategic acquisitions as part of our business if we are able to identify acquisition candidates such acquisitions may be financed to the extent permitted under our debt agreements with substantial debt or with potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities 

 

the food service market is affected by consumer preferences and perceptions changes in these preferences and perceptions may reduce the demand for our products which would reduce sales and harm our business 

food service businesses are affected by changes in consumer tastes international national regional and local economic conditions and demographic trends for instance if prevailing health or dietary preferences cause consumers to avoid pizza and other products we offer in favor of foods that are perceived as healthier our business and operating results would be harmed moreover because we are primarily dependent on a single product if consumer demand for pizza should decrease our business would suffer more than if we had a more diversified menu as many other food service businesses do the preferences of customers also may change as a result of advances in technology or alternative delivery methods or channels if we are not able to respond to these changes or our competitors respond to these changes more effectively our business and operating results could be adversely affected 

reports of foodborne illness or food tampering could reduce sales and harm our business 

reports whether true or not of foodborne illnesses such as e coli avian flu bovine spongiform encephalopathy hepatitis a trichinosis or salmonella and injuries caused by food tampering have in the past severely injured the reputations of participants in the qsr sector and could in the future as well the potential for acts of terrorism on our global food supply also exists and if such an event occurs it could have a negative impact on us and could severely hurt sales and profits in addition our reputation is an important asset as a result anything that damages our reputation could immediately and severely affect our sales and profits media reports of illnesses and injuries whether accurate or not could force some stores to close or otherwise reduce sales at such stores in addition reports of foodborne illnesses or food tampering even those occurring solely at the restaurants of competitors could by resulting in negative publicity about the restaurant industry adversely affect us on a local regional national or international basis 

increases in food labor and other costs could adversely affect our profitability and operating results 

an increase in our operating costs could adversely affect our profitability factors such as inflation increased food costs increased labor and employee health and benefit costs increased rent costs and increased energy costs may adversely affect our operating costs most of the factors affecting costs are beyond our control and in many cases we may not be able to pass along these increased costs to our customers or franchisees most ingredients used in our pizza particularly cheese are subject to significant price fluctuations as a result of seasonality weather demand and other factors cheese is a significant cost to us representing approximately 2025 of the market basket purchased by our companyowned stores labor costs are largely a function of the minimum wage for a majority of our store personnel and certain supply chain center personnel and generally are also a function of the availability of labor several states in which we operate have recently approved minimum wage increases as minimum wage increases are implemented in these states or if such increases are approved and implemented in other states in which we operate we expect our labor costs will increase labor costs and food costs including cheese represent approximately 50 to 60 of the sales at a typical companyowned store 

we do not have longterm contracts with certain of our suppliers and as a result they could seek to significantly increase prices or fail to deliver 

we do not have longterm contracts or arrangements with certain of our suppliers although in the past we have not experienced significant problems with our suppliers our suppliers may implement significant price increases or may not meet our requirements in a timely fashion or at all the occurrence of any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

shortages or interruptions in the supply or delivery of fresh food products could adversely affect our operating results 

we and our franchisees are dependent on frequent deliveries of food products that meet our specifications in addition we have single suppliers or a limited number of suppliers for certain of our ingredients including pizza cheese while we believe there are adequate reserve quantities and potential alternative suppliers shortages or interruptions in the supply of food products caused by increased demand capacity constraints problems in production or distribution financial or other difficulties of suppliers inclement weather or other conditions could adversely affect the availability quality and cost of ingredients could adversely affect our operating results 

any prolonged disruption in the operations of any of our dough manufacturing and supply chain centers could harm our business 

we operate 18 regional dough manufacturing and supply chain centers one thin crust manufacturing center and one vegetable processing center in the united states and five dough manufacturing and supply chain centers in canada an additional regional dough manufacturing and food supply chain center is expected to open in fiscal 2018 

 

our domestic dough manufacturing and supply chain centers service all of our companyowned and domestic franchise stores as a result any prolonged disruption in the operations of any of these facilities whether due to technical or labor difficulties destruction or damage to the facility real estate issues limited capacity or other reasons could adversely affect our business and operating results 

our success depends in part upon effective advertising and lower advertising funds may reduce our ability to adequately market the domino’s pizza brand 

we have been routinely named a leading national advertiser by advertising age  each domino’s store located in the contiguous united states is obligated to pay a percentage of its sales in advertising fees in fiscal 2017 each store in the contiguous united states generally was required to contribute 6 of their sales to dnaf subject in limited instances to lower rates based on certain incentives and waivers which uses such fees for national advertising in addition to contributions for local marketlevel advertising we currently anticipate that this 6 contribution rate will remain in place for the foreseeable future while additional funds for advertising in the past have been provided by us our franchisees and other third parties none of these additional funds are legally required the lack of continued financial support for advertising activities could significantly curtail our marketing efforts which may in turn materially and adversely affect our business and our operating results 

we face risks of litigation and negative publicity from customers franchisees suppliers employees and others in the ordinary course of business which can or could divert our financial and management resources any adverse litigation or publicity may negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations 

claims of illness or injury relating to food quality or food handling are common in the food service industry and vehicular accidents and injuries occur in the food delivery business claims within our industry of improper supplier actions also occasionally arise that if made against one of our suppliers could potentially damage our brand image in addition class action lawsuits have been filed and may continue to be filed against various quick service restaurants alleging among other things that quick service restaurants have failed to disclose the health risks associated with highfat foods and that quick service restaurant marketing practices have encouraged obesity in addition to decreasing our sales and profitability and diverting our management resources adverse publicity or a substantial judgment against us could negatively impact our financial condition results of operations and brand reputation thereby hindering our ability to attract and retain franchisees and grow our business 

further we may be subject to employee franchisee and other claims in the future based on among other things discrimination harassment wrongful termination and wage rest break and meal break issues and those claims relating to overtime compensation we are currently subject to these types of claims and have been subject to these types of claims in the past if one or more of these claims were to be successful or if there is a significant increase in the number of these claims or if we receive significant negative publicity our business financial condition and operating results could be harmed 

loss of key employees or our inability to attract and retain new qualified employees could hurt our business and inhibit our ability to operate and grow successfully 

our success in the highly competitive pizza delivery and carryout business will continue to depend to a significant extent on our leadership team and other key management personnel although we have entered into employment agreements with richard e allison jr and russell j weiner each of these executives may terminate his agreement on ninety days’ notice our other executive officers may terminate their employment pursuant to their employment agreements at any time as a result we may not be able to retain our executive officers and key personnel or attract additional qualified management while we do not have longterm employment agreements with our executive officers for all of our executive officers we have noncompete and nonsolicitation agreements that extend for 24 months following the termination of such executive officer’s employment our success will also continue to depend on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel to operate our stores dough manufacturing and supply chain centers and international operations the loss of these employees or our inability to recruit and retain qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 

adverse global economic conditions subject us to additional risk 

our financial condition and results of operations are impacted by global markets and economic conditions over which neither we nor our franchisees have control an economic downturn including deterioration in the economic conditions in the us or international markets where we compete may result in a reduction in the demand for our products longer payment cycles slower adoption of new technologies and increased price competition

poor economic conditions may adversely affect the ability of our franchisees to pay royalties or amounts owed and could have a material adverse impact on our ability to pursue our growth strategy which would reduce cash collections and in turn may materially and adversely affect our ability to service our debt obligations 

 

our international operations subject us to additional risk such risks and costs may differ in each country in which we and our franchisees do business and may cause our profitability to decline due to increased costs 

we conduct a significant and growing portion of our business outside the united states our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected if global markets in which our franchise stores compete are affected by changes in political economic or other factors these factors over which neither we nor our franchisees have control may include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 fluctuations in the value of the us dollar in relation to other currencies may lead to lower revenues and earnings 

exchange rate fluctuations could have an adverse effect on our results of operations approximately 74 of our total revenues in 2017 72 of our total revenues in 2016 and 74 of our total revenues in 2015 were derived from our international franchise segment a majority of which were denominated in foreign currencies we also operate dough manufacturing and distribution facilities in canada which generate revenues denominated in canadian dollars sales made by franchise stores outside the united states are denominated in the currency of the country in which the store is located and this currency could become less valuable in us dollars as a result of exchange rate fluctuations unfavorable currency fluctuations could lead to increased prices to customers outside the united states or lower profitability to our franchisees outside the united states or could result in lower revenues for us on a us dollar basis from such customers and franchisees a hypothetical 10 adverse change in the foreign currency rates in our international markets would have resulted in a negative impact on international royalty revenues of approximately 179 million in 2017 

we may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property which could harm the value of our brand and branded products and adversely affect our business 

we depend in large part on our brand and branded products and believe that they are very important to our business we rely on a combination of trademarks copyrights service marks trade secrets and similar intellectual property rights to protect our brand and branded products the success of our business depends on our continued ability to use our existing trademarks and service marks in order to increase brand awareness and further develop our branded products in both domestic and international markets we have registered certain trademarks and have other trademark registrations pending in the united states and foreign jurisdictions not all of the trademarks that we currently use have been registered in all of the countries in which we do business and they may never be registered in all of these countries we may not be able to adequately protect our trademarks and our use of these trademarks may result in liability for trademark infringement trademark dilution or unfair competition all of the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property in the united states and in foreign countries may not be adequate in addition the laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states further through acquisitions of third parties we may acquire brands and related trademarks that are subject to the same risks as the brands and trademarks we currently own 

we may from time to time be required to institute or defend litigation to enforce our trademarks or other intellectual property rights or to protect our trade secrets such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could negatively affect our sales profitability and prospects regardless of whether we are able to successfully enforce our rights 

 

our earnings and business growth strategy depends on the success of our franchisees and we may be harmed by actions taken by our franchisees or employees of our franchisees that are outside of our control 

a significant portion of our earnings comes from royalties and fees generated by our franchise stores franchisees are independent operators and their employees are not our employees we provide tools for franchisees to use in training their employees but the quality of franchise store operations and our brand and branded products may be diminished by any number of factors beyond our control franchisees may not operate stores in a manner consistent with our standards and requirements or they or their employees may take other actions that adversely affect the value of our brand in such event our business and reputation may suffer and as a result our revenues and stock price could decline 

as of december 31 2017 we had 789 domestic franchisees operating 5195 domestic stores fourteen of these franchisees each own and operate over 50 domestic stores including our largest domestic franchisee who owns and operates 187 stores and the average franchisee owns and operates seven stores 

our international master franchisees are generally responsible for the development of significantly more stores than our domestic franchisees as a result our international operations are more closely tied to the success of a smaller number of franchisees than our domestic operations our largest international master franchisee operates 2170 stores in seven markets which accounts for approximately 23 of our total international store count our domestic and international franchisees may not operate their franchises successfully if one or more of our key franchisees were to become insolvent or otherwise were unable or unwilling to pay us our royalties or other amounts owed our business and results of operations would be adversely affected 

the occurrence of cyber incidents or a deficiency in cybersecurity could negatively impact our business by causing a disruption to our operations a compromise or corruption of confidential information or damage to our employee and business relationships any of which could subject us to loss and harm our brand 

a cyber incident is considered to be any adverse event that threatens the confidentiality integrity or availability of information resources more specifically a cyber incident is an intentional attack or an unintentional event that can include gaining unauthorized access to systems to disrupt operations corrupt data or steal confidential information about customers franchisees suppliers or employees a number of retailers and other companies have recently experienced serious cyber incidents and breaches of their information technology systems as our reliance on technology has increased so have the risks posed to our systems both internal and those we have outsourced the three primary risks that could directly result from the occurrence of a cyber incident include operational interruption damage to our relationships with customers franchisees and employees and private data exposure in addition to maintaining insurance coverage to address cyber incidents we have also implemented processes procedures and controls to help mitigate these risks however our cyber insurance coverage may not cover the costs of a cyber incident and these measures as well as our increased awareness of the risk of a cyber incident do not guarantee that our reputation and financial results will not be adversely affected by such an incident 

because we and our franchisees accept electronic forms of payment from customers our business requires the collection and retention of customer data including sensitive data and other personally identifiable information in various information systems that we and our franchisees maintain and in those maintained by third parties with whom we and our franchisees contract to provide payment processing we also maintain important internal company data such as personally identifiable information about our employees and franchisees and information relating to our operations in addition more than half of all global retail sales in 2017 were derived from digital channels primarily through our online ordering website and mobile applications where customers enter personally 

identifiable information that we retain our use and retention of personally identifiable information is regulated by foreign federal and state laws as well as by certain thirdparty agreements as privacy and information security laws and regulations change we may incur additional costs to ensure that we remain in compliance with those laws and regulations if our security and information systems are compromised or if our employees or franchisees fail to comply with these laws regulations or contract terms and this information is obtained by unauthorized persons or used inappropriately it could adversely affect our reputation and could disrupt our operations and result in costly litigation judgments or penalties laws and regulations governing cyber incidents could require us to notify customers employees or other groups result in adverse publicity loss of sales and profits increase fees payable to third parties and result in penalties or remediation and other costs that could adversely affect our business and results of operations any other material disruption or other adverse event affecting one or more of our digital ordering platforms could similarly result in a loss of sales and profits which could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

 

we are subject to extensive government regulation and requirements issued by other groups and our failure to comply with existing or increased regulations could adversely affect our business and operating results 

we are subject to numerous federal state local and foreign laws and regulations as well as requirements issued by other groups including those relating to 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 the affordable care act requires employers such as us to provide health insurance for all qualifying employees or pay penalties for not providing coverage the majority of the increases in these costs began in 2015 and while the incremental costs of this program have not been material to us to date we cannot predict what effect these costs will have on our results of operations and financial position or the effects of the affordable care act on some of our larger franchisees modifications to or repeal of all or certain provisions of the affordable care act are possible consistent with statements made by certain elected officials 

the 2017 tax act was signed into law on december 22 2017 significantly reforming the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the 2017 tax act among other things includes changes to us federal tax rates imposes significant additional limitations on the deductibility of interest allows for the expensing of capital expenditures puts into effect the migration from a “worldwide” system of taxation to a territorial system and modifies or repeals many business deductions and credits we continue to examine the impact the 2017 tax act may have on our business the estimated impact of the 2017 tax act is based on our management’s current knowledge and assumptions and recognized impacts could be materially different from current estimates based on our actual results and our further analysis of the new law we revalued our net deferred tax assets and liabilities at the newly enacted corporate tax rate in fiscal 2017 while the impact of this new legislation was not material to our 2017 financial statements we expect to have a significantly lower effective tax rate in future periods 

we may also become subject to legislation or regulation seeking to tax andor regulate highfat foods foods with high sugar and salt content or foods otherwise deemed to be “unhealthy” if we fail to comply with existing or future laws and regulations we may be subject to governmental or judicial fines or sanctions in addition our capital expenditures could increase due to remediation measures that may be required if we are found to be noncompliant with any of these laws or regulations 

we are also subject to a federal trade commission rule and to various state and foreign laws that govern the offer and sale of franchises additionally these laws regulate various aspects of the franchise relationship including terminations and the refusal to renew franchises the failure to comply with these laws and regulations in any jurisdiction or to obtain required government approvals could result in a ban or temporary suspension on future franchise sales fines or other penalties or require us to make offers of rescission or restitution any of which could adversely affect our business and operating results 

our current insurance coverage may not be adequate insurance premiums for such coverage may increase and we may not be able to obtain insurance at acceptable rates or at all 

we have retention programs for workers’ compensation general liability and owned and nonowned automobile liabilities we are generally responsible for up to 10 million per occurrence under these retention programs for workers’ compensation and general liability we are generally responsible for between 500000 and 30 million per occurrence under these retention programs for owned and nonowned automobile liabilities total insurance limits under these retention programs vary depending upon the period covered and range up to 1100 million per occurrence for general liability and owned and nonowned automobile liabilities and up to the applicable statutory limits for workers’ compensation these insurance policies may not be adequate to protect us from liabilities that we incur in our business in addition in the future our insurance premiums may increase and we may not be able to obtain similar levels of insurance on reasonable terms or at all any such inadequacy of or inability to obtain insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

our annual and quarterly financial results are subject to significant fluctuations depending on various factors many of which are beyond our control and if we fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors our share price may decline significantly 

our sales and operating results can vary significantly from quartertoquarter and yeartoyear depending on various factors many of which are beyond our control these factors include among other things 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 as a result our operational performance may decline quickly and significantly in response to changes in order patterns or rapid decreases in demand for our products we anticipate that fluctuations in operating results will continue in the future 

our common stock price could be subject to significant fluctuations andor may decline 

the market price of our common stock could be subject to significant fluctuations among the factors that could affect our stock price are 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 the stock markets in general have experienced volatility that has sometimes been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies these broad market fluctuations may cause the trading price of our common stock to decline 

our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our business and limit our ability to plan for or respond to changes in our business 

we have a substantial amount of indebtedness as of december 31 2017 our consolidated total indebtedness was approximately 315 billion we may also incur additional debt which would not be prohibited under the terms of our current securitized debt agreements our substantial indebtedness could have important consequences to our business and our shareholders for example it could 

 

  

  

  

 in addition the financial and other covenants we agreed to with our lenders may limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness make investments pay dividends and engage in other transactions and the leverage may cause potential lenders to be less willing to loan funds to us in the future our failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default that if not cured or waived could result in the acceleration of repayment of all of our indebtedness 

 

we may be unable to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our significant debt service obligations which would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

our ability to make principal and interest payments on and to refinance our indebtedness will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future this to a certain extent is subject to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control if our business does not generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the amounts projected or at all or if future borrowings are not available to us under our variable funding notes in amounts sufficient to fund our other liquidity needs our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected if we cannot generate sufficient cash flow from operations to make scheduled principal amortization and interest payments on our debt obligations in the future we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity sell assets delay capital expenditures or seek additional equity if we are unable to refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all or to effect any other action relating to our indebtedness on satisfactory terms or at all our business may be harmed 

the terms of our securitized debt financing of certain of our whollyowned subsidiaries have restrictive terms and our failure to comply with any of these terms could put us in default which would have an adverse effect on our business and prospects 

unless and until we repay all outstanding borrowings under our securitized debt we will remain subject to the restrictive terms of these borrowings the securitized debt under which certain of our whollyowned subsidiaries issued and guaranteed fixed rate notes and variable funding senior revolving notes contain a number of covenants with the most significant financial covenant being a debt service coverage calculation these covenants limit the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to among other things 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 the securitized debt also requires us to maintain specified financial ratios at the end of each fiscal quarter these restrictions could affect our ability to pay dividends or repurchase shares of our common stock our ability to meet these financial ratios can be affected by events beyond our control and we may not satisfy such a test a breach of this covenant could result in a rapid amortization event or default under the securitized debt if amounts owed under the securitized debt are accelerated because of a default under the securitized debt and we are unable to pay such amounts the investors may have the right to assume control of substantially all of the securitized assets 

during the term following issuance the outstanding senior notes will accrue interest in accordance with the terms of the debt agreements additionally our senior notes have original scheduled principal payments of 320 million in each of 2018 and 2019 5095 million in 2020 270 million in 2021 8798 million in 2022 180 million in each of 2023 and 2024 7420 million in 2025 100 million in 2026 and 9075 million in 2027 in accordance with our debt agreements the payment of principal on the outstanding senior notes shall be suspended if the leverage ratios for the company are less than or equal to 50x total debt as defined to adjusted ebitda as defined and no catchup provisions are applicable 

if we are unable to refinance or repay amounts under the securitized debt prior to the expiration of the term our cash flow would be directed to the repayment of the securitized debt and other than a weekly management fee sufficient to cover minimal selling general and administrative expenses would not be available for operating our business 

no assurance can be given that any refinancing or additional financing will be possible when needed or that we will be able to negotiate acceptable terms in addition our access to capital is affected by prevailing conditions in the financial and capital markets and other factors beyond our control there can be no assurance that market conditions will be favorable at the times that we require new or additional financing 

the indenture governing the securitized debt will restrict the cash flow from the entities subject to the securitization to any of our other entities and upon the occurrence of certain events cash flow would be further restricted 

in the event that a rapid amortization event occurs under the indenture including without limitation upon an event of default under the indenture or the failure to repay the securitized debt at the end of its term the funds available to us would be reduced or eliminated which would in turn reduce our ability to operate or grow our business

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of these financial statements requires our management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis our management evaluates its estimates including those related to revenue recognition longlived and intangible assets insurance and legal matters sharebased payments and income taxes we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from those estimates changes in our accounting policies and estimates could materially impact our results of operations and financial condition for any particular period we believe that our most critical accounting policies and estimates are 

revenue recognition  we earn revenues through our network of domestic companyowned and franchised stores dough manufacturing and supply chain centers and international operations retail sales from franchise stores are reported to the company by its franchisees and are not included in company revenues retail sales from companyowned stores and royalty revenues resulting from the retail sales from franchised stores are recognized as revenues when the items are delivered to or carried out by customers retail sales are generally reported and related royalties paid to the company based on a percentage of retail sales as specified in the related standard franchise agreement generally 55 of domestic franchise retail sales and on average 30 of international franchise retail sales revenues from companyowned stores and royalty revenues and fees from franchised stores can fluctuate from timetotime as a result of store count and sales level changes this can occur when a companyowned store is sold to a franchisee if a companyowned store that generated 1000000 in revenue in fiscal 2016 was sold to a franchisee in fiscal 2017 revenues from companyowned stores would have declined by 1000000 in fiscal 2017 while franchise royalty revenues would have increased by only 55000 in fiscal 2017 as we generally collect 55 of a domestic franchisee’s retail sales sales of food from our supply chain centers are recognized as revenues upon delivery of the food to franchisees while sales of equipment and supplies are generally recognized as revenues upon shipment of the related products to franchisees 

longlived and intangible assets we record longlived assets including property plant and equipment and capitalized software at cost for acquisitions of franchise operations we estimate the fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired based on physical inspection of assets historical experience and other information available to us regarding the acquisition we depreciate and amortize longlived assets using useful lives determined by us based on historical experience and other information available to us we evaluate the potential impairment of longlived assets at least annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable our evaluation is based on various analyses including the projection of undiscounted cash flows for companyowned stores we perform related impairment tests on an operating market basis which the company has determined to be the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of other cash flows if the carrying amount of a longlived asset exceeds the amount of the expected future undiscounted cash flows of that asset the company estimates the fair value of the asset if the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset an impairment loss is recognized and the asset is written down to its estimated fair value 

we have not made any significant changes in the methodology used to project the future market cash flows of companyowned stores during the years presented same store sales fluctuations and the rates at which operating costs will fluctuate in the future are key factors in evaluating recoverability of the related assets if our same store sales significantly decline or if operating costs increase and we are unable to recover these costs the carrying value of our companyowned stores by market may be unrecoverable and we may be required to recognize an impairment charge the company did not record any impairment charges during fiscal 2017 fiscal 2016 or fiscal 2015 

a significant portion of our goodwill relates to acquisitions of domestic franchise stores and is included in our domestic stores segment specifically in our companyowned stores division we evaluate goodwill annually for impairment by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit which is primarily determined using the present value of future cash flows to its carrying value if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value goodwill would be impaired we have not made any significant changes in the methodology used to evaluate goodwill impairment during the years presented at december 31 2017 the fair value of our business operations with 

 

associated goodwill exceeded their recorded carrying value including the related goodwill if cash flows generated by our companyowned stores were to decline significantly in the future or there were negative revisions to the market multiple assumption we may be required to recognize a goodwill impairment charge however based on the latest impairment analysis we do not believe it is reasonably likely that there could be changes in assumptions that would trigger impairment 

insurance and legal matters we are a party to lawsuits and legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business management closely monitors these legal matters and estimates the probable costs for the resolution of such matters these estimates are primarily determined by consulting with both internal and external parties handling the matters and are based upon an analysis of potential results assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies legal judgments can be volatile and difficult to predict accordingly if our estimates relating to legal matters proved inaccurate for any reason we may be required to increase or decrease the related expense in future periods we had accruals for legal matters of approximately 17 million at december 31 2017 and 27 million at january 1 2017 

for certain periods prior to december 1998 and for periods after december 2001 we maintain insurance coverage for workers’ compensation general liability and owned and nonowned auto liability under insurance policies requiring payment of a deductible for each occurrence up to between 500000 and 30 million depending on the policy year and line of coverage the related insurance reserves are based on undiscounted independent actuarial estimates which are based on historical information along with assumptions about future events specifically various methods including analyses of historical trends and actuarial valuation methods are utilized to estimate the cost to settle reported claims and claims incurred but not yet reported the actuarial valuation methods develop estimates of the future ultimate claim costs based on the claims incurred as of the balance sheet date when estimating these liabilities several factors are considered including the severity duration and frequency of claims legal cost associated with claims healthcare trends and projected inflation 

our methodology for determining our exposure has remained consistent throughout the years presented management believes that the various assumptions developed and actuarial methods used to determine our selfinsurance reserves are reasonable and provide meaningful data that management uses to make its best estimate of our exposure to these risks changes in assumptions for such factors as medical costs and legal actions as well as changes in actual experience could cause our estimates to change in the near term which could result in an increase or decrease in the related expense in future periods a 10 change in our selfinsurance liability at december 31 2017 would have affected our income before provision for income taxes by approximately 51 million for fiscal 2017 we had accruals for insurance matters of approximately 514 million at december 31 2017 and 439 million at january 1 2017 

sharebased payments we recognize compensation expense related to our sharebased compensation arrangements over the requisite service period based on the grant date fair value of the awards the grant date fair value of each restricted stock and performancebased restricted stock award is equal to the market price of our stock on the date of grant the grant date fair value of each stock option award is estimated using a blackscholes option pricing model the pricing model requires assumptions including the expected life of the stock option the riskfree interest rate the expected dividend yield and expected volatility of our stock over the expected life which significantly impact the assumed fair value we account for forfeitures as they occur additionally our stock option restricted stock and performancebased restricted stock arrangements provide for accelerated vesting and the ability to exercise during the remainder of the tenyear stock option life upon the retirement of individuals holding the awards who have achieved specified service and age requirements 

management believes that the methods and various assumptions used to determine compensation expense related to these arrangements are reasonable but if the assumptions change significantly for future grants sharebased compensation expense will fluctuate in future years 

income taxes we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities we measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using current enacted tax rates that will apply in the years in which we expect the temporary differences to be recovered or paid judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes related reserves and deferred tax assets and liabilities these include establishing a valuation allowance related to the ability to realize certain deferred tax assets if necessary on an ongoing basis management will assess whether it remains more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets will be realized the company did not have any valuation allowances recorded for deferred tax assets as of december 31 2017 and had valuation allowances recorded for deferred tax assets of approximately 01 million as of january 1 2017 our accounting for deferred tax assets represents our best estimate of future events our net deferred tax assets assume that we will generate sufficient taxable income in specific tax jurisdictions based on our estimates and assumptions changes in our current estimates due to unanticipated events could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

 

the amounts recorded on the balance sheet relating to uncertain tax positions consider the ultimate resolution of revenue agent reviews based on estimates and assumptions we believe we have appropriately accounted for our uncertain tax positions however tax audits changes in tax laws and other unforeseen matters may result in us owing additional taxes we adjust our reserves for uncertain tax positions when facts and circumstances change or due to the passage of time the completion of a tax audit or the expiration of a statute of limitations associated with uncertain tax positions are examples of situations when we may adjust our reserves management believes that our tax positions comply with applicable tax law and that we have adequately provided for these matters however to the extent the final tax outcome of these matters is different than our recorded amounts we may be required to adjust our tax reserves resulting in additional income tax expense or benefit in future periods

revenues revenues primarily consist of retail sales from our companyowned stores royalties and fees from our domestic and international franchised stores and sales of food equipment and supplies from our supply chain centers to all of our domestic franchised stores and certain international franchised stores companyowned store and franchised store revenues may vary from period to period due to changes in store count mix supply chain revenues may vary significantly as a result of fluctuations in commodity prices as well as the mix of products we sell 

consolidated revenues increased 3154 million or 128 in 2017 the increase was due primarily to higher supply chain food volumes as well as higher companyowned store domestic franchise and international franchise revenues resulting from same store sales and store count growth these changes in revenues are more fully described below 

domestic stores revenues from domestic stores are primarily comprised of retail sales from domestic companyowned store operations as well as royalties from retail sales and other fees from domestic franchised stores as summarized in the following table 

 

 higher domestic companyowned same store sales royalty revenues earned on higher franchise same store sales and an increase in the average number of stores open drove an increase in overall domestic store revenues of 909 million or 121 these results are more fully described below 

domestic companyowned stores revenues from domestic companyowned store operations increased 518 million or 118 in 2017 this increase was due to an 87 increase in same store sales as compared to 2016 and an increase in the average number of stores open during the year 

domestic franchise revenues from domestic franchise operations increased 391 million or 125 in 2017 the increase was driven by a 76 increase in same store sales as compared to 2016 and an increase in the average number of stores open during the year revenues further benefited from higher fees paid by franchisees for the use of our internally developed technology platforms 

supply chain revenues from supply chain operations are primarily comprised of sales of food equipment and supplies from our supply chain centers to all of our domestic franchised stores and certain international franchised stores as summarized in the following table 

 

 domestic supply chain domestic supply chain revenues increased 1661 million or 118 in 2017 these increases were primarily attributable to higher volumes from increased order counts at the store level as well as store count growth our market basket pricing to stores increased 17 during 2017 which resulted in an estimated 188 million increase in domestic supply chain revenues 

international supply chain revenues from international supply chain operations increased 286 million or 211 in 2017 driven primarily by higher volumes from increased order counts at the store level the positive impact of foreign currency exchange rates of 34 million in 2017 also contributed to the increases 

international franchise international franchise revenues primarily consist of royalties from retail sales and other fees from our international franchise stores revenues from international franchise operations increased 297 million or 168 in 2017 this increase was due to an increase in the average number of international stores open during 2017 as well as higher same store sales and an increase in technology fees and was offset slightly by the negative impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates of approximately 08 million in 2017 excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rates same store sales increased 34 in 2017 compared to 2016 

 

cost of sales  operating margin consolidated cost of sales consists primarily of domestic companyowned store and supply chain costs incurred to generate related revenues components of consolidated cost of sales primarily include food labor and occupancy costs the changes to the consolidated operating margin which we define as revenues less cost of sales are summarized in the following table 

 

 the 983 million or 128 increase in consolidated operating margin was due to higher domestic and international franchise revenues as well as higher supply chain and companyowned store margins franchise revenues do not have a cost of sales component so changes in franchise revenues have a disproportionate effect on the consolidated operating margin 

as a percentage of total revenues our consolidated operating margin increased 01 percentage points in 2017 due to a higher mix of franchise revenues and higher supply chain margin as a percentage of supply chain revenues companyowned store operating margin decreased 13 percentage points during 2017 these changes in margin are more fully discussed below

general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses increased 312 million or 99 in 2017 primarily driven by continued investments in technological initiatives primarily in ecommerce and information technology as well as investments in other strategic areas higher companyowned store national advertising contributions resulting from higher same store sales also contributed to the increase these increases were partially offset by lower performancebased compensation expense and a pretax gain recognized from the sale of 17 companyowned stores during the fourth quarter of 2017 of 40 million 

interest income interest income increased 08 million to 15 million in 2017 

 

interest expense interest expense increased 124 million to 1225 million in 2017 this increase was driven by higher average borrowings and approximately 58 million of expenses related to the 2017 recapitalization these expenses include a 55 million writeoff of debt issuance costs and 03 million of interest expense that was incurred on the 2012 debt subsequent to the closing of the 2017 recapitalization but prior to the repayment of the 2012 debt the increase in interest expense was offset in part by a lower weightedaverage borrowing rate 

our average outstanding debt balance excluding capital lease obligations was approximately 263 billion in 2017 and approximately 223 billion in 2016 the increase in the average outstanding debt balance was due to the issuance of debt in connection with the 2017 recapitalization our weighted average borrowing rate decreased to 42 in fiscal 2017 from 46 in fiscal 2016 the decreases in the company’s cash borrowing rate resulted from the lower interest rates on the debt issued as part of the 2017 recapitalization 

provision for income taxes provision for income taxes decreased 78 million to 1222 million in 2017 although pretax income increased in 2017 the effective tax rate decreased primarily as a result of the company’s adoption of asu 201609 compensation – stock compensation topic 718 improvements to employee sharebased payment accounting “asu 201609” which requires tax benefits on equitybased compensation to be recorded as a reduction to the income tax provision the adoption of this standard benefitted the provision for income taxes by 272 million in 2017 the effective tax rate decreased to 306 in 2017 as compared to 377 in 2016

domestic supply chain domestic supply chain revenues increased 1424 million or 113 in 2016 these increases were primarily attributable to higher volumes from increased order counts at the store level they were partially offset by lower commodity prices and the estimated 278 million positive impact in 2015 related to the inclusion of the 53 rd week the lower cheese block price passed through directly in domestic supply chain pricing to franchisees did not have a material impact on domestic supply chain revenues in 2016 we estimate that lower commodity prices resulted in an approximate 30 million decrease in domestic supply chain revenues during 2016 

international supply chain revenues from international supply chain operations increased 187 million or 160 in 2016 this increase resulted primarily from higher volumes from increased order counts at the store level in 2016 and was offset in part by the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates of approximately 43 million in 2016 and the estimated 26 million positive impact in 2015 related to the inclusion of the 53 rd week

as a percentage of supply chain revenues the supply chain operating margin increased 03 percentage points in 2016 due to lower casualty and health insurance expenses higher volumes from store count growth and increased store order counts as well as lower fuel costs increased labor costs partially offset these increases decreases in certain food prices have a positive effect on the supply chain operating margin percentage due to the fixed dollar margin earned by supply chain on certain food items lower commodity prices decreased both revenues and costs by 30 million in fiscal 2016 lower cheese prices did not have a material impact in 2016 if our us cheese prices for 2016 had been in effect during 2015 the supply chain operating margin as a percentage of supply chain revenues would have remained the same the dollar margin would also have been unaffected 

general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses increased 359 million or 129 in 2016 these increases were driven by continued investments in technological initiatives and labor primarily in ecommerce information technology and international operations as well as higher performancedriven expenses resulting from improved operating performance and higher same store sales including variable performancebased compensation and companyowned store national advertising contributions general and administrative expenses were positively impacted by the nonrecurrence of an estimated 47 million of expenses from the inclusion of the 53 rd week in 2015 

interest income interest income increased slightly to 07 million in 2016 

interest expense interest expense increased 105 million to 1101 million in 2016 the increase was driven by a higher average debt balance as a result of the 2015 recapitalization and was offset in part by a lower cash borrowing rate

historically we have operated with minimal positive working capital or negative working capital primarily because our receivable collection periods and inventory turn rates are faster than the normal payment terms on our current liabilities we generally collect our receivables within three weeks from the date of the related sale and we generally experience 35 to 45 inventory turns per year in addition our sales are not typically seasonal which further limits our working capital requirements these factors coupled with the use of our ongoing cash flows from operations to service our debt obligations invest in our business pay dividends and repurchase our common stock reduce our working capital amounts as of december 31 2017 we had negative working capital of 103 million excluding restricted cash and cash equivalents of 1918 million and including total unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of 358 million 

as of december 31 2017 we had approximately 1229 million of restricted cash and cash equivalents held for future principal and interest payments and 321 million of restricted cash equivalents held in a threemonth interest reserve as required by the related debt agreements 367 million of cash held as collateral for outstanding letters of credit and 01 million of other restricted cash for a total of 1918 million of restricted cash and cash equivalents 

 

our primary source of liquidity is cash flows from operations and availability of borrowings under our variable funding notes in connection with the 2017 recapitalization the company issued a new variable funding note facility which allows for advances of up to 1750 million of series 20171 variable funding senior secured notes class a1 notes and certain other credit instruments including letters of credit the “2017 variable funding notes” the variable funding notes were undrawn on the closing date the company’s previous variable funding note facility was canceled

under the provisions of the company’s previously existing debt agreements during the first and second quarters of 2017 the company met the maximum leverage ratios of less than 45x and accordingly did not make previously scheduled debt amortization payments in accordance with the debt agreements subsequent to the 2017 recapitalization the company’s leverage ratios exceeded the new maximum leverage ratio of 50x and accordingly the company began making the scheduled amortization payments 

share repurchase programs 

the company’s open market share repurchase programs have historically been funded by excess cash flows the company used cash of approximately 106 billion in 2017 3003 million in 2016 and 7386 million in 2015 for share repurchases the company had approximately 1985 million left under its 125 billion authorization as of december 31 2017 the company’s board of directors authorized a new share repurchase program to repurchase up to 7500 million of the company’s common stock on february 14 2018 this repurchase program replaces the remaining availability of approximately 1985 million under its previously approved 125 billion share repurchase program 

capital expenditures 

in the past three years we have invested approximately 2142 million in capital expenditures in 2017 we invested 903 million in capital expenditures which primarily related to investments in our supply chain centers our proprietary internally developed pointofsale system domino’s pulse our digital ordering platform new companyowned stores our internal enterprise systems reimaging our existing companyowned stores and other technology initiatives we did not have any material commitments for capital expenditures as of december 31 2017 

 

the following table illustrates the main components of our cash flows 

 

 operating activities 

cash provided by operating activities increased 517 million in 2017 from 2016 primarily due to an increase in net income of 632 million net income in 2017 included a 272 million benefit from the adoption of asu 201609 which requires tax benefits on equitybased compensation to be recorded as a reduction to the provision from income taxes in net income and as a component of cash provided by operating activities in 2016 these tax benefits were recorded directly to stockholders’ deficit and as a financing activity in the statement of cash flows cash provided by operating activities was also positively impacted by an increase in noncash amounts of 181 million these increases were offset in part by the negative impact of changes in operating assets and liabilities of 296 million primarily related to the timing of payments on accounts payable and accrued liabilities during 2017 as compared to 2016 

cash provided by operating activities decreased 45 million in 2016 from 2015 primarily due to the negative impact of changes in operating assets and liabilities of 237 million resulting from the timing of payments for accounts payable and accrued liabilities in 2016 as compared to 2015 this decrease was offset in part by an increase in net income of 219 million 

we are focused on continually improving our net income and cash flow from operations and management expects to continue to generate positive cash flows from operating activities for the foreseeable future 

investing activities 

during fiscal 2017 cash used in investing activities was 1490 million which consisted primarily of 900 million of capital expenditures driven by investments in our technological initiatives supply chain centers and companyowned stores and the increase in restricted cash and cash equivalents of 653 million these uses of cash were offset in part by the proceeds from the sale of assets of 68 million 

during fiscal 2016 cash used in investing activities was 08 million which consisted primarily of 586 million of capital expenditures driven by investments related to the reimaging of our existing companyowned stores and investments in our supply chain centers and training facilities our proprietary internally developed pointofsale system our digital ordering platform our internal enterprise systems and other technology initiatives offset in part by the decrease in restricted cash and cash equivalents of 544 million and by proceeds from the sale of assets of 49 million 

during fiscal 2015 cash used in investing activities was 1093 million which consisted primarily of 633 million of capital expenditures driven by investments related to the reimaging of our existing companyowned stores and investments in our supply chain centers and training facilities our proprietary internally developed pointofsale system our digital ordering platform our internal enterprise systems and other technology initiatives increases in restricted cash and cash equivalents of 600 million and offset by proceeds from the sale of assets of 127 million 

financing activities 

during fiscal 2017 cash used in financing activities was 1971 million we issued 19 billion of debt in connection with our 2017 recapitalization which was offset by purchases of common stock of 106 billion repayments of longterm debt of 9282 million of which 9102 million was repayment of the remaining 2012 fixed rate notes using a portion of the proceeds received from the 2017 recapitalization funding dividend payments to our shareholders of 843 million and cash paid for financing costs related to our 2017 recapitalization of 168 million we also made 94 million in tax payments for restricted stock upon vesting and received proceeds of 61 million from the exercise of stock options 

during fiscal 2016 cash used in financing activities was 3758 million purchases of common stock totaled 3003 million repayments of longterm debt and capital lease obligations totaled 1223 million and funding dividend payments to our shareholders totaled 739 million the net tax impact of equitybased compensation was 425 million proceeds from issuance of debt from our draws on our variable funding note facility totaled 630 million and proceeds from the exercise of stock options totaled 152 million 

 

during fiscal 2015 cash used in financing activities was 809 million in fiscal 2015 we issued 13 billion of debt in connection with our 2015 recapitalization which was offset by the purchases of common stock of 7386 million repayments of longterm debt of 5644 million of which 5513 million was an optional prepayment on our 2012 fixed rate notes using a portion of the proceeds received from the 2015 recapitalization funding dividend payments to our shareholders of 803 million and cash paid for financing costs related to our 2015 recapitalization of 174 million the net tax impact of equitybased compensation of 103 million increased cash from financing activities in fiscal 2015 

our ability to continue to fund these items and continue to reduce debt could be adversely affected by the occurrence of any of the events described in item 1a risk factors there can be no assurance that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operations or that future borrowings will be available under the 2017 variable funding notes or otherwise to enable us to service our indebtedness or to make anticipated capital expenditures our future operating performance and our ability to service extend or refinance the fixed and floating rate notes and to service extend or refinance the 2017 variable funding notes will be subject to future economic conditions and to financial business and other factors many of which are beyond our control 

impact of inflation 

inflation did not have a material impact on our operations in 2017 2016 or 2015 severe increases in inflation however could affect the global and us economies and could have an adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations further discussion on the impact of commodities and other cost pressures is included above as well as in item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

new accounting pronouncements 

recently adopted accounting standards 

in march 2016 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued asu 201609 compensation – stock compensation topic 718 improvements to employee sharebased payment accounting asu 201609 asu 201609 is intended to simplify several areas of accounting for sharebased compensation arrangements including the income tax impact classification on the statement of cash flows and forfeitures the new standard was effective for the company beginning january 2 2017 

as a result excess tax benefits or deficiencies from equitybased compensation activity are reflected in the consolidated statements of income as a component of the provision for income taxes whereas they previously were recognized in the consolidated statement of stockholders’ deficit the company also elected to account for forfeitures as they occur rather than to use an estimate of expected forfeitures for financial statement reporting purposes the adoption of asu 201609 resulted in a decrease in our provision for income taxes of 272 million in fiscal 2017 primarily due to the recognition of excess tax benefits for options exercised and the vesting of equity awards the company’s election to account for forfeitures as they occur had an immaterial impact on its equitybased compensation expense 

the company adopted the cash flow presentation prospectively and accordingly excess tax benefits from equitybased compensation of 272 million in fiscal 2017 are presented as an operating activity while 481 million and 178 million of excess tax benefits from equitybased compensation in fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015 respectively are presented as a financing activity the presentation requirements for cash flows related to taxes paid for restricted stock upon vesting had no impact on our consolidated statements of cash flows for any of the periods presented because such cash flows have historically been presented as a financing activity 

accounting standards not yet adopted 

the company has considered all new accounting pronouncements issued by the fasb and concluded the following accounting pronouncements may have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements or represent accounting pronouncements for which the company has not yet completed its assessment 

in may 2014 the fasb issued accounting standards update 201409 revenue from contracts with customers topic 606  or accounting standards codification 606 “asc 606” this guidance outlines a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance issued by the fasb including industry specific guidance under the new revenue recognition standard entities apply a fivestep model that depicts the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services specifically companies identify the performance obligations within their contracts with customers allocate the transaction price received from customers to each performance obligation 

 

identified within their contracts and recognize revenue as the performance obligations are satisfied during 2015 2016 and 2017 the fasb issued various amendments which provide additional clarification and implementation guidance on asc 606 specifically these amendments clarify how an entity should identify the specified good or service for the principal versus agent evaluation and how it should apply the control principle to certain types of arrangements clarify how an entity should identify performance obligations and licensing implementation guidance as well as account for shipping and handling fees and freight service assess collectability present sales tax treat noncash consideration and account for completed and modified contracts at the time of transition the new guidance requires enhanced disclosures including revenue recognition policies to identify performance obligations to customers and significant judgments in measurement and recognition the effective date and transition requirements for asc 606 and amendments is for fiscal years and for interim periods within those years beginning after december 15 2017 and the company will adopt this guidance using the modified retrospective approach effective january 1 2018 

the company has substantially completed its assessment of asc 606 and the adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on its recognition of sales from companyowned stores ongoing royalty fees which are based on a percentage of franchise sales revenues from its supply chain centers development fees or technology fees 

the company has determined that the store opening fees received from international franchisees do not contain separate and distinct performance obligations from the franchise right and those upfront fees will therefore be recognized as revenue over the term of each respective franchise agreement currently we recognize such fees as revenue when received the company does not expect this to have a material impact on its international franchise revenues however an adjustment to beginning retained earnings and a corresponding contract liability of approximately 15 million will be established on the date of adoption associated with the fees received through december 31 2017 that would have been deferred and recognized over the term of each respective franchise agreement if the new guidance had been applied in the past 

the company has also determined that asc 606 requires a gross presentation on the consolidated statement of income for franchisee contributions received by and related expenses of domino’s national advertising fund inc “dnaf” our consolidated notforprofit subsidiary dnaf exists solely for the purpose of promoting the domino’s pizza brand in the us the company currently presents the restricted assets and liabilities of dnaf in its consolidated balance sheets and under existing accounting guidance has determined that it acts as an agent for accounting purposes with regard to franchise store contributions and disbursements as a result the company currently presents the activities of dnaf net in its statements of income under asc 606 the company has determined that there are not separate performance obligations associated with the franchise advertising contributions received by dnaf and as a result these franchise contributions and the related expenses will be presented gross in the company’s consolidated statement of income the company expects this change to have a material impact on its total revenues and expenses beginning in fiscal 2018 however as the amount of revenues to be recorded is directly tied to future franchise retail sales and advertising contribution rates the company is not able to reasonably estimate the impact if this guidance were in effect in fiscal 2017 the company would have reported incremental franchise advertising revenues and expenses of approximately 324 million in its consolidated statement of income while this change will materially impact the gross amount of reported franchise revenues and expenses the impact will generally be an offsetting increase to both revenues and expenses such that the impact on income from operations and net income if any would not be material we will also present the activity associated with dnaf on a gross basis in the statement of cash flows beginning in fiscal 2018 

in february 2016 the fasb issued asu 201602 leases topic 842  asu 201602 requires a lessee to recognize assets and liabilities on the balance sheet for leases with lease terms greater than 12 months asu 201602 is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after december 15 2018 and early adoption is permitted based on a preliminary assessment the company expects the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on its assets and liabilities due to the recognition of rightofuse assets and lease liabilities on its consolidated balance sheets at the beginning of the earliest period presented the company is continuing its assessment which may identify additional impacts this guidance will have on its consolidated financial statements and disclosures our current minimum lease commitments are disclosed in note 5 

in march 2016 the fasb issued asu 201604 liabilities – extinguishment of liabilities subtopic 40520 recognition of breakage for certain prepaid storedvalue products  asu 201604 aligns recognition of the financial liabilities related to prepaid storedvalue products for example gift cards with topic 606 revenues from contracts with customers  for nonfinancial liabilities in general these liabilities may be extinguished proportionately in earnings as redemptions occur or when redemption is remote if issuers are not entitled to the unredeemed stored value asu 201604 is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after december 15 2017 and early adoption is permitted the company plans to adopt this guidance effective january 1 2018 in connection with our adoption of asc 606 and does not expect it to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements 

 

in june 2016 the fasb issued asu 201613 measurement of credit losses on financial instruments  asu 201613 requires companies to measure credit losses utilizing a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires a consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates asu 201613 is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2019 including those interim periods within those fiscal years the company is currently assessing the impact of adopting this standard but based on a preliminary assessment does not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements 

in november 2016 the fasb issued asu 201618 statement of cash flows topic 230 restricted cash asu 201618 which requires that restricted cash and cash equivalents be included as components of total cash and cash equivalents as presented on the statement of cash flows asu 201618 is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after december 15 2017 and a retrospective transition method is required the company currently presents changes in restricted cash and cash equivalents in the investing section of its consolidated statement of cash flows the new guidance will not impact financial results but will result in a change in the presentation of restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents within the statement of cash flows the company currently plans to adopt this guidance in the first quarter of 2018 using the retrospective approach 

in january 2017 the fasb issued asu 201704  intangibles – goodwill and other topic 35 simplifying the test for goodwill impairment  or asu 201704 asu 201704 simplifies the subsequent measurement of goodwill by eliminating “step 2” from the goodwill impairment test asu 201704 is effective for public companies’ annual or interim goodwill impairment tests in fiscal years beginning after december 15 2019 early adoption is permitted for annual goodwill impairment tests performed on testing dates after january 1 2017 the company is currently assessing the impact of adopting this standard but based on a preliminary assessment does not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements 

contractual obligations 

the following is a summary of our significant contractual obligations at december 31 2017 

 

  

    liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits of 18 million are excluded from the above table as we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period of payment for additional information on unrecognized tax benefits see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we are party to letters of credit and to a lesser extent financial guarantees with offbalance sheet risk our exposure to credit loss for letters of credit and financial guarantees is represented by the contractual amounts of these instruments total conditional commitments under letters of credit as of december 31 2017 were approximately 467 million and relate to our insurance programs and supply chain center leases the company has guaranteed lease payments related to certain franchisees’ lease arrangements the maximum amount of potential future payments under these guarantees is 15 million as of december 31 2017 we believe that none of these arrangements has or is likely to have a material effect on our results of operations financial condition revenues or expenses capital expenditures or liquidity

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend market risk 

we do not engage in speculative transactions nor do we hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes in connection with the 2017 recapitalization we issued fixed and floating rate notes and at december 31 2017 we are exposed to interest rate risk on borrowings under our 2017 floating rate notes and our 2017 variable funding notes as of december 31 2017 we had no outstanding borrowings under our 2017 variable funding notes our fixed rate debt exposes the company to changes in market interest rates reflected in the fair value of the debt and to the risk that the company may need to refinance maturing debt with new debt at a higher rate 

we are exposed to market risks from changes in commodity prices during the normal course of business we purchase cheese and certain other food products that are affected by changes in commodity prices and as a result we are subject to volatility in our food costs we may periodically enter into financial instruments to manage this risk we do not engage in speculative transactions nor do we hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes in instances when we use fixed pricing agreements with our suppliers these agreements cover our physical commodity needs are not netsettled and are accounted for as normal purchases 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

we have exposure to various foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations for revenues generated by our operations outside the united states which can adversely impact our net income and cash flows approximately 74 of our total revenues in 2017 72 of our total revenues in 2016 and 74 of our total revenues in 2015 were derived from our international franchise segment a majority of which were denominated in foreign currencies we also operate dough manufacturing and distribution facilities in canada which generate revenues denominated in canadian dollars we do not enter into financial instruments to manage this foreign currency exchange risk a hypothetical 10 adverse change in the foreign currency rates for our international markets would have resulted in a negative impact on royalty revenues of approximately 179 million in 2017

 item 1 business tableend overview 

domino’s is the second largest pizza restaurant chain in the world with more than 13800 locations in over 85 markets around the world founded in 1960 our roots are in convenient pizza delivery while a significant amount of our sales also come from carryout customers although we are a highlyrecognized global brand we focus on serving the local neighborhoods in which we live and do business through our large network of franchise owners and companyowned stores on average we sell more than 2 million pizzas each day throughout our global system 

our business model is straightforward we handcraft and serve quality food at a competitive price with easy ordering access and efficient service enhanced by our technology innovations our dough is generally made fresh and distributed to stores around the world by us and our franchisees 

domino’s generates revenues and earnings by charging royalties to its franchisees royalties are ongoing percentofsales fees for use of the domino’s brand marks the company also generates revenues and earnings by selling food equipment and supplies to franchisees primarily in the us and canada and by operating a number of our own stores franchisees profit by selling pizza and other complementary items to their local customers in our international markets we generally grant geographical rights to the domino’s pizza ® brand to master franchisees these master franchisees are charged with developing their geographical area and they may profit by subfranchising and selling ingredients and equipment to those subfranchisees as well as by running pizza stores everyone in the system can benefit including the end consumer who can feed their family domino’s menu items conveniently and economically 

our business model can yield strong returns for our franchise owners and companyowned stores it can also yield significant cash flow to us through a consistent franchise royalty payment and supply chain revenue stream with moderate capital expenditures we have historically returned cash to shareholders through dividend payments and share repurchases since becoming a publiclytraded company

our history 

we pioneered the pizza delivery business and built domino’s pizza ® into one of the most widelyrecognized consumer brands in the world we have been delivering quality affordable food to our customers since 1960 when brothers thomas and james monaghan borrowed 900 to purchase a small pizza store in ypsilanti michigan thomas purchased his brother’s share of the business shortly thereafter concentrating first on building stores near college campuses and military bases in the 1960s and 1970s the brand grew quickly in the 1980s in urban markets and near residential communities we became “domino’s pizza” in 1965 and opened our first franchised store in 1967 the first international stores opened in 1983 in canada and australia 

monaghan sold 93 of his economic stake in the company in 1998 to bain capital llc then sold and transferred his remaining stake in the company in 2004 when we completed our initial public offering 

since 1998 the company has been structured with a leveraged balance sheet and has completed a number of recapitalization events the company’s most recent recapitalization transaction in 2015 the “2015 recapitalization” primarily consisted of the issuance of 13 billion of fixed rate notes and the repurchase and retirement of 5513 million of previously outstanding fixed rate notes following the 2015 recapitalization and including debt from its previous recapitalization in 2012 the “2012 recapitalization” the company had 224 billion in longterm debt 

we relaunched our brand in the us in late 2009 by introducing a new recipe for our core pizza product since 2008 the majority of our menu has changed either through the improvement of existing products or the introduction of new products such as our handmade pan pizza and specialty chicken during this time frame we also began expanding our focus on technology through our development of innovative ordering platforms and other technological advancements globally we opened our 10000 th store in 2012 and our 13000 th store in 2016 in 2013 we announced a plan requiring all stores to adopt our new “pizza theater” store design which is more inviting to customers and allows them to see their orders being made fresh in front of them our goal is to be substantially complete with these remodels by the end of 2017 

 

our industry 

the us qsr pizza category is large and fragmented from 2006 through 2016 the us qsr pizza category has grown from 331 billion to 358 billion it is the secondlargest category within the 2819 billion us qsr sector the us qsr pizza category is primarily comprised of delivery dinein and carryout 

in the us we compete primarily in the delivery and carryout segments of the pizza industry we are the market share leader in the delivery segment and we are amongst the top three chains in share in the carryout segment delivery segment sales of 100 billion in 2016 down from 114 billion in 2006 account for approximately 28 of total us qsr pizza the delivery segment declined during the period from 2006 to 2012 and has increased slightly since 2012 from 97 billion in 2012 to 100 billion in 2016 the three industry leaders including domino’s account for approximately 56 of us pizza delivery based on reported consumer spending with the remaining sales going to regional chains and independent establishments from 2006 to 2016 the carryout segment grew from 139 billion to 165 billion the four industry leaders including domino’s account for approximately 47 of the carryout segment 

in contrast to the us international pizza delivery is relatively underdeveloped with only domino’s and two other competitors having a significant global presence we believe that demand for pizza and pizza delivery is large and growing throughout the world driven by international consumers’ increasing emphasis on convenience and the proven success of our 30 years of conducting business abroad 

our competition 

the global pizza delivery and carryout segments are highly competitive in the us we compete against regional and local companies as well as national chains pizza hut ®  papa john’s ® and little caesars pizza ®  internationally we compete primarily with pizza hut ®  papa john’s ® and countryspecific national and local pizzerias we generally compete on the basis of product quality location image service technology and price our business and those of our competitors can be affected by changes in consumer tastes economic conditions demographic trends and consumers’ disposable income we compete not only for customers but also for employees suitable real estate sites and qualified franchisees 

our customers 

the company’s business is not dependent upon a single retail customer or small group of customers including franchisees no customer accounted for more than 10 of total consolidated revenues in 2016 2015 or 2014 our largest franchisee based on store count domino’s pizza enterprises asx dmp operates 1990 stores in seven international markets and accounts for 14 of our total store count revenues from this master franchisee accounted for 15 of our consolidated revenues in 2016 our international business unit only requires a minimal amount of general and administrative expenses to operate its markets and does not have costs of sales therefore the vast majority of these royalty revenues result in profits to us 

our menu 

we offer a menu designed to present an attractive quality offering to customers while keeping it simple enough to minimize order errors and expedite ordertaking and food preparation our basic menu features pizza products with varying sizes and crust types our typical store also offers ovenbaked sandwiches pasta boneless chicken and wings bread side items desserts and cocacola ® soft drink products international markets vary toppings by country and culture such as squid topping in japan or spicy cheese in india and often feature regional specialty items such as a banana and cinnamon dessert pizza in brazil 

store image and operations 

we have been focused primarily on pizza delivery for over 50 years as well as carryout as a significant component of our business in 2012 we introduced our carryoutfriendly pizza theater store design we expect that substantially all of our stores will convert to this design by the end of 2017 many stores will offer casual seating and will enable customers to watch the preparation of their orders but will not offer a fullservice dinein experience as a result our stores generally do not require expensive restaurant facilities and staffing 

research and development 

we conduct research and product development at our world resource center in ann arbor michigan companysponsored research and development activities which include testing new products for possible menu additions are an important activity for us and our franchisees we do not consider the amounts spent on research and development to be material 

 

our business segments 

we operate and report three business segments domestic stores international franchise and supply chain 

domestic stores 

our domestic stores segment consists primarily of our franchise operations which consist of 4979 franchised stores located in the contiguous united states we also operate a network of 392 domestic companyowned stores located in the contiguous united states 

during 2016 our domestic stores segment accounted for 7513 million or 30 of our consolidated revenues we use our companyowned stores as test sites for new products and promotions as well as operational improvements we also use them for training new store managers and operations team members as well as developing prospective franchisees while we are primarily a franchised business we continuously evaluate our mix of domestic companyowned and franchise stores 

we maintain a productive relationship with our independent franchise owners through regional franchise teams distributing materials that help franchise stores comply with our standards and using franchise advisory groups that facilitate communications between us and our franchisees 

domestic franchise profile 

as of january 1 2017 our network of 4979 domestic franchise stores were owned and operated by 799 domestic franchisees our franchise formula enables franchisees to benefit from our brand name with a relatively low initial capital investment as of january 1 2017 the average domestic franchisee owned and operated six stores and had been in our franchise system for over 17 years at the same time 14 of our domestic franchisees operated more than 50 stores including our largest domestic franchisee who operated 189 stores and 277 of our domestic franchisees each operated one store 

we apply rigorous standards to prospective domestic franchisees we generally require them to manage a store for at least one year before being granted a franchise this enables us to observe the operational and financial performance of a potential franchisee prior to entering into a longterm contract approximately 90 of our 799 independent domestic franchise owners started their careers with us as delivery drivers or in other instore positions we generally restrict the ability of domestic franchisees to be involved in other businesses which focuses our franchisees’ attention on operating their stores as a result the majority of our domestic franchisees have historically come from within the domino’s pizza system we believe these standards are largely unique to the franchise industry and result in qualified and focused franchisees operating their stores 

domestic franchise agreements 

we enter into franchise agreements with domestic franchisees under which the franchisee is generally granted the right to operate a store in a particular location for a term of ten years with an ability to renew for an additional term of ten years we have a franchise contract renewal rate of approximately 99 under the current standard franchise agreement we assign an exclusive area of primary responsibility to each franchised store each franchisee is generally required to pay a 55 royalty fee on sales in certain instances we will collect lower rates based on area development agreements sales initiatives and new store incentives 

our domestic stores currently contribute 6 of their retail sales to fund national marketing and advertising campaigns subject in limited instances to lower rates based on certain incentives and waivers these funds are administered by domino’s national advertising fund inc “dnaf” our notforprofit advertising subsidiary the funds are primarily used to purchase media for advertising but also support market research field communications public relations commercial production talent payments and other activities to promote the brand in addition to the national and marketlevel advertising contributions domestic stores spend additional funds on local store marketing activities 

we have the contractual right subject to state law to terminate a franchise agreement for a variety of reasons including but not limited to a franchisee’s failure to adhere to the company’s franchise agreement failure to make required payments or failure to adhere to specified company policies and standards 

 

international franchise 

our international franchise segment is comprised of a network of franchised stores in more than 85 international markets at january 1 2017 we had 8440 international franchise stores during 2016 this segment accounted for 1770 million or 7 of our consolidated revenues the principal sources of revenues from those operations are royalty payments generated by retail sales from franchised stores 

our international franchisees employ our basic standard operating model and adapt it to satisfy the local eating habits and consumer preferences of various regions outside the united states currently the vast majority of our international stores operate under master franchise agreements 

we believe domino’s appeals to potential international franchisees because of our recognized brand name and technological leadership the moderate capital expenditures required to open and operate our stores and our system’s favorable store economics in our top ten markets four master franchise companies are publicly traded on stock exchanges in australia asx dmp india jublfood ns mexico alsea mx and the united kingdom dom l the following table shows our store count as of january 1 2017 in our top ten international markets which account for approximately 67 of our international stores 

 

 international franchisee profile 

the vast majority of our markets outside of the contiguous united states are operated by master franchisees with franchise and distribution rights for entire regions or countries in a few select markets we franchise directly to individual store operators prospective master franchisees are required to possess local market knowledge to establish and develop domino’s pizza stores with the ability to identify and access targeted real estate sites as well as expertise in local laws customs culture and consumer behavior we also seek candidates that have access to sufficient capital to meet growth and development plans 

master franchise agreements 

our master franchise agreements generally grant the franchisee exclusive rights to develop or subfranchise stores and the right to operate supply chain centers in particular geographic areas agreements are generally for a term of ten to 20 years with options to renew for additional terms the agreements typically contain growth clauses requiring franchisees to open a minimum number of stores within a specified period the master franchisee is generally required to pay an initial onetime franchise fee as well as an additional franchise fee upon the opening of each new store the master franchisee is also required to pay a continuing royalty fee as a percentage of retail sales which varies among international markets and averaged approximately 30 in 2016 

supply chain 

our supply chain segment operates 18 regional dough manufacturing and food supply chain centers in the us one thin crust manufacturing center one vegetable processing center and one center providing equipment and supplies to certain of our domestic and international stores we also operate five dough manufacturing and food supply chain centers in canada our supply chain segment leases a fleet of more than 650 tractors and trailers during 2016 our supply chain segment accounted for 154 billion or 62 of our consolidated revenues 

our centers produce fresh dough and purchase receive store and deliver quality food and other complementary items to over 99 of our us and canadian franchised stores and all of our companyowned stores we regularly supply over 5800 stores with various food and supplies our supply chain segment made approximately 593000 fullservice deliveries in 2016 or approximately two deliveries per store per week and we produced over 462 million pounds of dough during 2016 

 

we believe our franchisees voluntarily choose to obtain food supplies and equipment from us because we offer the most efficient convenient and costeffective alternative while also offering both quality and consistency our supply chain segment offers profitsharing arrangements to franchisees who purchase all of their food for their stores from our centers these profitsharing arrangements generally offer participating franchisees and companyowned stores with 50 or a higher percentage in the case of companyowned stores and certain franchisees who operate a larger number of stores of their regional supply chain center’s pretax profits we believe these arrangements strengthen our ties and provide aligned benefits with franchisees 

thirdparty suppliers 

over half of our annual food spend is with suppliers where we have maintained a partnership of at least 20 years our supply partners are required to meet strict quality standards to ensure food safety we review and evaluate these partners’ quality assurance programs through among other actions onsite visits third party audits and product evaluations to ensure compliance with our standards we believe the length and quality of our relationships with thirdparty suppliers provides us with priority service and quality products at competitive prices 

cheese is our largest food cost the price we charge to our domestic franchisees for cheese is based on the chicago mercantile exchange cheddar block price plus a supply chain markup as cheese prices fluctuate our revenues and margin percentages in our supply chain segment also fluctuate however actual supply chain dollar margins remain unchanged we currently purchase our domestic pizza cheese from a single supplier under the september 2012 agreement our domestic supplier agreed to provide an uninterrupted supply of cheese and the company agreed to a fiveyear pricing schedule to purchase all of its domestic pizza cheese from this supplier while we expect to meet the terms of this agreement if we do not we will be required to repay the cost savings as outlined in the agreement the majority of our meat toppings in the us come from a single supplier under contracts that expire in march of 2017 we have the right to terminate these arrangements for quality failures and for uncured breaches 

we are party to a multiyear agreement with cocacola for the contiguous united states this contract renegotiated in december 2013 provides for cocacola to continue to be our exclusive beverage supplier and expires on december 31 2018 or at such time as a minimum number of cases of cocacola products are purchased by us whichever occurs later 

we believe alternative thirdparty suppliers are available for all of these referenced products while we may incur additional costs if we are required to replace any of our supply partners we do not believe such additional costs would have a material adverse effect on our business we continually evaluate each supply category to determine the optimal sourcing strategy 

we have not experienced any significant shortages of supplies or delays in receiving our inventories or products prices charged to us by our supply partners are subject to fluctuation and we have historically been able to pass increased costs and savings on to our stores we periodically enter into supplier contracts to manage the risk from changes in commodity prices we do not engage in speculative transactions nor do we hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes 

our strengths 

strong brand equity 

we are the second largest pizza company in the world we believe our domino’s pizza ® brand is one of the most widelyrecognized consumer brands in the world we are the recognized world leader in pizza delivery and have a significant business in carryout we believe consumers associate our brand with the timely delivery of quality affordable food 

over the past five years our us franchise and companyowned stores have invested an estimated 16 billion in national cooperative and local advertising our international franchisees also invest significant amounts in advertising efforts in their markets we continue to reinforce our brand with extensive advertising through various media channels we have also enhanced the strength of our brand through marketing affiliations with brands such as cocacola 

we are the number one pizza delivery company in the united states with a 270 share of pizza delivery based on reported consumer spending with 5371 stores located in the contiguous united states our store delivery areas cover a majority of us households our share position and scale allow us to leverage our purchasing power supply chain strength and marketing investments we believe our scale and market coverage allow us to effectively serve our customers’ demands for convenience and timely delivery outside the us we have significant market share positions in many of the markets in which we compete 

 

strong and proven business model 

our business model is comprised of domestic and international franchise royalties and fees revenue from supply chain and revenue from retail sales at companyowned stores we have developed this model over our many years of operation and it is anchored by strong storelevel economics which provide an entrepreneurial incentive for our franchisees and historically has generated demand for new stores our franchise system in turn has produced strong and consistent earnings for us through royalty payments and through supply chain revenues with moderate capital expenditures by us 

we developed a costefficient store model characterized by a delivery and carryoutoriented store design with moderate capital requirements and a menu of quality affordable items at the store level we believe the simplicity and efficiency of our operations give us significant advantages over our competitors who in many cases also focus on dinein or have broader menu offerings at the supply chain level we believe we provide quality and consistency for our franchise customers while also driving profits for us which we share with our franchisees 

our menu simplifies and streamlines production and delivery processes and maximizes economies of scale on purchases of our principal food items in addition our stores are small historically averaging approximately 1500 square feet and less expensive to build furnish and maintain as compared to many other restaurant concepts although new stores built in our pizza theater design may be slightly larger than stores we have built in the past they are still generally smaller and less expensive than many other restaurant concepts the combination of this efficient store model and strong sales volume has resulted in strong storelevel financial returns and we believe makes domino’s pizza an attractive business opportunity for existing and prospective franchisees around the world 

we believe our store economics have led to a strong welldiversified franchise system this established franchise system has produced strong cash flow and earnings for us enabling us to invest in the domino’s pizza ® brand stores technology and supply chain centers pay significant dividends repurchase and retire shares of our common stock and repurchase and retire outstanding principal on our fixed rate notes 

technological innovation 

technological innovation is vital to our brand and our longterm success digital ordering is critical to competing in the global pizza industry in 2016 more than half of our us sales came via digital platforms that metric is higher in some of our international markets we believe we are among the largest ecommerce retailers in terms of annual transactions after launching digital ordering domestically in 2008 we made the strategic decision in 2010 to develop our own online ordering platform and to manage this important and growing area of our business internally over the next five years we launched mobile applications that cover 95 of the smartphones and tablets on the us market in 2013 we launched an enhanced online ordering profiles platform allowing customers the ability to reorder their favorite order in as few as five clicks or 30 seconds in 2014 we introduced “dom” a voice ordering application which we believe is the first in the restaurant industry and we also made the domino’s tracker ® available on the pebble smartwatch platform in 2015 we introduced several innovative ordering platforms including samsung smart tv ®  twitter and text message using a pizza emoji we continued this trend of innovation in 2016 with the introduction of zeroclick ordering as well as adding google home facebook messenger apple watch and amazon echo to our ordering platforms 

during 2015 the company also launched its “piece of the pie rewards” loyalty program which is meant to reward customers with a program that is simple to understand and easy to use upon signing up for the program customers become rewards members and can earn points for online orders when rewards members reach a certain amount of points they can redeem their points for free pizza rewards members may also receive exclusive membersonly discounts and bonus offers we may also occasionally provide additional opportunities for participating customers to benefit under the “piece of the pie rewards” program 

all of this improved functionality has been developed to work seamlessly with our domino’s pulse ™ pointofsale system our domino’s pulse system is designed to drive operating efficiencies for our franchisees and our corporate management and assist franchisees in independently managing their business we have installed domino’s pulse in every companyowned store in the us in more than 99 of our domestic franchised stores and in over 65 of our international stores 

we believe utilizing domino’s pulse with our integrated technology solutions throughout our system provides us with competitive advantages over other concepts we intend to continue to enhance and grow our online ordering digital marketing and technological capabilities 

 

product innovation 

in late 2009 we reintroduced our core pizza in the us with a new recipe which we believe has been key to our continued growth in customer reorder rate consumer traffic and increased sales this recipe is now in use in the vast majority of markets around the world our more than 50 years of innovation have resulted in numerous new product developments including our more recent innovations of handmade pan pizza specialty chicken parmesan bread bites stuffed cheesy bread and marbled cookie brownie among others product innovation is also present in our global markets where our master franchisees have the ability to recommend products to suit their local market tastes products include the mayo jaga in japan bacon potatoes and sweet mayonnaise and the saumoneta in france light cream potatoes onions smoked salmon and dill 

internal dough manufacturing and supply chain system 

in addition to generating significant revenues and earnings in the united states and canada we believe our vertically integrated dough manufacturing and supply chain system enhances the quality and consistency of our products enhances our relationships with franchisees and leverages economies of scale to offer lower costs to our stores it also allows store managers to better focus on store operations and customer service by relieving them of the responsibility of mixing dough in the stores and sourcing other ingredients many of our international master franchisees also profit from running supply chain businesses 

our ideals 

we believe in opportunity hard work inspired solutions winning together embracing community and uncommon honesty 

opportunity abounds at domino’s you can start in an entrylevel position and become a store owner – in fact approximately 90 of our independent domestic franchise owners started their careers with us as delivery drivers or in other instore positions thousands of other team members – supervisors trainers quality auditors international business consultants marketers and executives – also began their careers in the stores internal growth and providing opportunities for anyone willing to work hard is the foundation of our core beliefs 

the ideals of inspired solutions uncommon honesty and winning together were driving forces behind the relaunch of our brand we were inspired by our harshest critics when it came to the perceived taste of our pizza our solution was not simply more advertising the solution was to create a new recipe and a broader menu of greattasting products our marketing campaign was shockingly honest in its approach telling consumers and showing them via television ads that we heard their negative feedback and were listening and without the buyin from our franchise owners we couldn’t have done it we believe that we can’t focus solely on the company’s success we must focus on making our stores and our franchisees successful that’s winning together 

community involvement

 item 1a risk factors tableend the quick service restaurant pizza category is highly competitive and such competition could adversely affect our operating results 

in the us we compete against regional and local companies as well as national chains pizza hut ®  papa john’s ® and little caesars pizza ®  internationally we compete primarily with pizza hut ®  papa john’s ® and countryspecific national and local pizzerias we could experience increased competition from existing or new companies in the pizza category which could create increasing pressures to grow our business in order to maintain our market share if we are unable to maintain our competitive position we could experience downward pressure on prices lower demand for our products reduced margins the inability to take advantage of new business opportunities and the loss of market share all of which would have an adverse effect on our operating results and could cause our stock price to decline 

we also compete on a broader scale with quick service and other international national regional and local restaurants the overall food service market and the quick service restaurant sector are intensely competitive with respect to food quality price service image convenience and concept and are often affected by changes in 

 

  

  

  

  

 we compete within the food service market and the quick service restaurant sector not only for customers but also for management and hourly employees suitable real estate sites and qualified franchisees our supply chain segment is also subject to competition from outside suppliers while over 99 of domestic franchisees purchased food equipment and supplies from us in 2016 domestic franchisees are not required to purchase food equipment or supplies from us and they may choose to purchase from outside suppliers if other suppliers who meet our qualification standards were to offer lower prices or better service to our franchisees for their ingredients and supplies and as a result our franchisees chose not to purchase from our domestic supply chain centers our financial condition business and results of operations would be adversely affected 

if we fail to successfully implement our growth strategy which includes opening new domestic and international stores our ability to increase our revenues and operating profits could be adversely affected 

a significant component of our growth strategy includes the opening of new domestic and international stores we and our franchisees face many challenges in opening new stores including among others 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 the opening of additional franchise stores also depends in part upon the availability of prospective franchisees who meet our criteria our failure to add a significant number of new stores would adversely affect our ability to increase revenues and operating income additionally our growth strategy and the success of new stores depend in large part on the availability of suitable store sites if we and our franchisees are not able to secure leases in desired locations on favorable terms or to renew such leases our business and results of operations may be adversely affected 

we and our franchisees are currently planning to expand our international operations in many of the markets where we currently operate and in select new markets this may require considerable management time as well as startup expenses for market development before any significant revenues and earnings are generated operations in new foreign markets may achieve low margins or may be unprofitable and expansion in existing markets may be affected by local economic and market conditions therefore as we expand internationally we or our franchisees may not experience the operating margins we expect our results of operations may be negatively impacted and our common stock price may decline 

we may also pursue strategic acquisitions as part of our business if we are able to identify acquisition candidates such acquisitions may be financed to the extent permitted under our debt agreements with substantial debt or with potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities 

 

the food service market is affected by consumer preferences and perceptions changes in these preferences and perceptions may reduce the demand for our products which would reduce sales and harm our business 

food service businesses are affected by changes in consumer tastes international national regional and local economic conditions and demographic trends for instance if prevailing health or dietary preferences cause consumers to avoid pizza and other products we offer in favor of foods that are perceived as more healthy our business and operating results would be harmed moreover because we are primarily dependent on a single product if consumer demand for pizza should decrease our business would suffer more than if we had a more diversified menu as many other food service businesses do the preferences of customers also may change as a result of advances in technology or alternative delivery methods or channels if we are not able to respond to these changes or our competitors respond to these changes more effectively our business and operating results could be adversely affected 

reports of foodborne illness or food tampering could reduce sales and harm our business 

reports whether true or not of foodborne illnesses such as e coli avian flu bovine spongiform encephalopathy hepatitis a trichinosis or salmonella and injuries caused by food tampering have in the past severely injured the reputations of participants in the qsr sector and could in the future as well the potential for acts of terrorism on our global food supply also exists and if such an event occurs it could have a negative impact on us and could severely hurt sales and profits in addition our reputation is an important asset as a result anything that damages our reputation could immediately and severely affect our sales and profits media reports of illnesses and injuries whether accurate or not could force some stores to close or otherwise reduce sales at such stores in addition reports of foodborne illnesses or food tampering even those occurring solely at the restaurants of competitors could by resulting in negative publicity about the restaurant industry adversely affect us on a local regional national or international basis 

increases in food labor and other costs could adversely affect our profitability and operating results 

an increase in our operating costs could adversely affect our profitability factors such as inflation increased food costs increased labor and employee health and benefit costs increased rent costs and increased energy costs may adversely affect our operating costs most of the factors affecting costs are beyond our control and in many cases we may not be able to pass along these increased costs to our customers or franchisees most ingredients used in our pizza particularly cheese are subject to significant price fluctuations as a result of seasonality weather demand and other factors the cheese block price per pound averaged 156 in 2016 and the estimated increase in companyowned store food costs from a hypothetical 025 adverse change in the average cheese block price per pound would have been approximately 25 million in 2016 labor costs are largely a function of the minimum wage for a majority of our store personnel and certain supply chain center personnel and generally are also a function of the availability of labor labor costs and food costs including cheese represent approximately 50 to 60 of the sales at a typical companyowned store 

we do not have longterm contracts with certain of our suppliers and as a result they could seek to significantly increase prices or fail to deliver 

we do not have longterm contracts or arrangements with certain of our suppliers although in the past we have not experienced significant problems with our suppliers our suppliers may implement significant price increases or may not meet our requirements in a timely fashion or at all the occurrence of any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

shortages or interruptions in the supply or delivery of fresh food products could adversely affect our operating results 

we and our franchisees are dependent on frequent deliveries of food products that meet our specifications in addition we have single suppliers or a limited number of suppliers for certain of our ingredients including pizza cheese while we believe there are adequate reserve quantities and potential alternative suppliers shortages or interruptions in the supply of food products caused by unanticipated demand problems in production or distribution financial or other difficulties of suppliers inclement weather or other conditions could adversely affect the availability quality and cost of ingredients could adversely affect our operating results 

any prolonged disruption in the operations of any of our dough manufacturing and supply chain centers could harm our business 

we operate 18 regional dough manufacturing and supply chain centers one thin crust manufacturing center and one vegetable processing center in the united states and five dough manufacturing and supply chain centers in canada our domestic dough manufacturing and supply chain centers service all of our companyowned stores and over 99 of our domestic franchise stores 

 

as a result any prolonged disruption in the operations of any of these facilities whether due to technical or labor difficulties destruction or damage to the facility real estate issues limited capacity or other reasons could adversely affect our business and operating results 

our success depends in part upon effective advertising and lower advertising funds may reduce our ability to adequately market the domino’s pizza ® brand 

we have been routinely named a leading national advertiser by advertising age  each domino’s store located in the contiguous united states is obligated to pay a percentage of its sales in advertising fees in fiscal 2016 each store in the contiguous united states generally was required to contribute 6 of their sales to dnaf subject in limited instances to lower rates based on certain incentives and waivers which uses such fees for national advertising in addition to contributions for local marketlevel advertising we currently anticipate that this 6 contribution rate will remain in place for the foreseeable future while additional funds for advertising in the past have been provided by us our franchisees and other third parties none of these additional funds are legally required the lack of continued financial support for advertising activities could significantly curtail our marketing efforts which may in turn materially and adversely affect our business and our operating results 

we face risks of litigation and negative publicity from customers franchisees suppliers employees and others in the ordinary course of business which can or could divert our financial and management resources any adverse litigation or publicity may negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations 

claims of illness or injury relating to food quality or food handling are common in the food service industry and vehicular accidents and injuries occur in the food delivery business claims within our industry of improper supplier actions also occasionally arise that if made against one of our suppliers could potentially damage our brand image in addition class action lawsuits have been filed and may continue to be filed against various quick service restaurants alleging among other things that quick service restaurants have failed to disclose the health risks associated with highfat foods and that quick service restaurant marketing practices have encouraged obesity in addition to decreasing our sales and profitability and diverting our management resources adverse publicity or a substantial judgment against us could negatively impact our financial condition results of operations and brand reputation thereby hindering our ability to attract and retain franchisees and grow our business 

further we may be subject to employee franchisee and other claims in the future based on among other things discrimination harassment wrongful termination and wage rest break and meal break issues and those claims relating to overtime compensation we are currently subject to these types of claims and have been subject to these types of claims in the past if one or more of these claims were to be successful or if there is a significant increase in the number of these claims or if we receive significant negative publicity our business financial condition and operating results could be harmed 

loss of key employees or our inability to attract and retain new qualified employees could hurt our business and inhibit our ability to operate and grow successfully 

our success in the highly competitive pizza delivery and carryout business will continue to depend to a significant extent on our leadership team and other key management personnel other than with our president and chief executive officer j patrick doyle we do not have longterm employment agreements with any of our executive officers as a result we may not be able to retain our executive officers and key personnel or attract additional qualified management while we do not have longterm employment agreements with our executive officers for all of our executive officers we have noncompete and nonsolicitation agreements that extend for 24 months following the termination of such executive officer’s employment our success will also continue to depend on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel to operate our stores dough manufacturing and supply chain centers and international operations the loss of these employees or our inability to recruit and retain qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 

adverse global economic conditions subject us to additional risk 

our financial condition and results of operations are impacted by global markets and economic conditions over which neither we nor our franchisees have control an economic downturn including deterioration in the economic conditions in the us or international markets where we compete may result in a reduction in the demand for our products longer payment cycles slower adoption of new technologies and increased price competition poor economic conditions may adversely affect the ability of our franchisees to pay royalties or amounts owed and could have a material adverse impact on our ability to pursue our growth strategy which would reduce cash collections and in turn may materially and adversely affect our ability to service our debt obligations 

 

our international operations subject us to additional risk such risks and costs may differ in each country in which we and our franchisees do business and may cause our profitability to decline due to increased costs 

we conduct a significant and growing portion of our business outside the united states our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected if global markets in which our franchise stores compete are affected by changes in political economic or other factors these factors over which neither we nor our franchisees have control may include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 fluctuations in the value of the us dollar in relation to other currencies may lead to lower revenues and earnings 

exchange rate fluctuations could have an adverse effect on our results of operations approximately 72 of our total revenues in 2016 74 of our total revenues in 2015 and 77 of our total revenues in 2014 were derived from our international franchise segment a majority of which were denominated in foreign currencies we also operate dough manufacturing and distribution facilities in canada which generate revenues denominated in canadian dollars sales made by franchise stores outside the united states are denominated in the currency of the country in which the store is located and this currency could become less valuable in us dollars as a result of exchange rate fluctuations unfavorable currency fluctuations could lead to increased prices to customers outside the united states or lower profitability to our franchisees outside the united states or could result in lower revenues for us on a us dollar basis from such customers and franchisees a hypothetical 10 adverse change in the foreign currency rates in our international markets would have resulted in a negative impact on international royalty revenues of approximately 167 million in 2016 

we may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property which could harm the value of our brand and branded products and adversely affect our business 

we depend in large part on our brand and branded products and believe that they are very important to our business we rely on a combination of trademarks copyrights service marks trade secrets and similar intellectual property rights to protect our brand and branded products the success of our business depends on our continued ability to use our existing trademarks and service marks in order to increase brand awareness and further develop our branded products in both domestic and international markets we have registered certain trademarks and have other trademark registrations pending in the united states and foreign jurisdictions not all of the trademarks that we currently use have been registered in all of the countries in which we do business and they may never be registered in all of these countries we may not be able to adequately protect our trademarks and our use of these trademarks may result in liability for trademark infringement trademark dilution or unfair competition all of the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property in the united states and in foreign countries may not be adequate in addition the laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states further through acquisitions of third parties we may acquire brands and related trademarks that are subject to the same risks as the brands and trademarks we currently own 

we may from time to time be required to institute or defend litigation to enforce our trademarks or other intellectual property rights or to protect our trade secrets such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could negatively affect our sales profitability and prospects regardless of whether we are able to successfully enforce our rights 

 

our earnings and business growth strategy depends on the success of our franchisees and we may be harmed by actions taken by our franchisees or employees of our franchisees that are outside of our control 

a significant portion of our earnings comes from royalties and fees generated by our franchise stores franchisees are independent operators and their employees are not our employees we provide tools for franchisees to use in training their employees but the quality of franchise store operations and our brand and branded products may be diminished by any number of factors beyond our control franchisees may not operate stores in a manner consistent with our standards and requirements or they or their employees may take other actions that adversely affect the value of our brand in such event our business and reputation may suffer and as a result our revenues and stock price could decline 

as of january 1 2017 we had 799 domestic franchisees operating 4979 domestic stores fourteen of these franchisees each own and operate over 50 domestic stores including our largest domestic franchisee who owns and operates 189 stores and the average franchisee owns and operates six stores 

our international master franchisees are generally responsible for the development of significantly more stores than our domestic franchisees as a result our international operations are more closely tied to the success of a smaller number of franchisees than our domestic operations our largest international master franchisee operates 1990 stores in seven markets which accounts for approximately 24 of our total international store count our domestic and international franchisees may not operate their franchises successfully if one or more of our key franchisees were to become insolvent or otherwise were unable or unwilling to pay us our royalties or other amounts owed our business and results of operations would be adversely affected 

the occurrence of cyber incidents or a deficiency in cybersecurity could negatively impact our business by causing a disruption to our operations a compromise or corruption of confidential information or damage to our employee and business relationships any of which could subject us to loss and harm our brand 

a cyber incident is considered to be any adverse event that threatens the confidentiality integrity or availability of information resources more specifically a cyber incident is an intentional attack or an unintentional event that can include gaining unauthorized access to systems to disrupt operations corrupt data or steal confidential information about customers franchisees suppliers or employees a number of retailers and other companies have recently experienced serious cyber incidents and breaches of their information technology systems as our reliance on technology has increased so have the risks posed to our systems both internal and those we have outsourced the three primary risks that could directly result from the occurrence of a cyber incident include operational interruption damage to our relationships with customers franchisees and employees and private data exposure in addition to maintaining insurance coverage to address cyber incidents we have also implemented processes procedures and controls to help mitigate these risks however these measures as well as our increased awareness of the risk of a cyber incident do not guarantee that our reputation and financial results will not be adversely affected by such an incident 

because we and our franchisees accept electronic forms of payment from customers our business requires the collection and retention of customer data including sensitive data and other personally identifiable information in various information systems that we and our franchisees maintain and in those maintained by third parties with whom we and our franchisees contract to provide payment processing we also maintain important internal company data such as personally identifiable information about our employees and franchisees and information relating to our operations our use of personally identifiable information is regulated by foreign federal and state laws as well as by certain thirdparty agreements as privacy and information security laws and regulations change we may incur additional costs to ensure that we remain in compliance with those laws and regulations if our security and information systems are compromised or if our employees or franchisees fail to comply with these laws regulations or contract terms and this information is obtained by unauthorized persons or used inappropriately it could adversely affect our reputation and could disrupt our operations and result in costly litigation judgments or penalties a cyber incident could also require us to notify customers employees or other groups result in adverse publicity loss of sales and profits increase fees payable to third parties and result in penalties or remediation and other costs that could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

we are subject to extensive government regulation and requirements issued by other groups and our failure to comply with existing or increased regulations could adversely affect our business and operating results 

we are subject to numerous federal state local and foreign laws and regulations as well as requirements issued by other groups including those relating to 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 the affordable care act requires employers such as us to provide health insurance for all qualifying employees or pay penalties for not providing coverage the majority of the increases in these costs began in 2015 and while the incremental costs of this program have not been material to us to date we cannot predict what effect these costs will have on our results of operations and financial position or the effects of the affordable care act on some of our larger franchisees modifications to or repeal of all or certain provisions of the affordable care act are possible consistent with statements made by certain elected officials 

we may also become subject to legislation or regulation seeking to tax andor regulate highfat foods foods with high sugar and salt content or foods otherwise deemed to be “unhealthy” if we fail to comply with existing or future laws and regulations we may be subject to governmental or judicial fines or sanctions in addition our capital expenditures could increase due to remediation measures that may be required if we are found to be noncompliant with any of these laws or regulations 

we are also subject to a federal trade commission rule and to various state and foreign laws that govern the offer and sale of franchises additionally these laws regulate various aspects of the franchise relationship including terminations and the refusal to renew franchises the failure to comply with these laws and regulations in any jurisdiction or to obtain required government approvals could result in a ban or temporary suspension on future franchise sales fines or other penalties or require us to make offers of rescission or restitution any of which could adversely affect our business and operating results 

our current insurance coverage may not be adequate insurance premiums for such coverage may increase and we may not be able to obtain insurance at acceptable rates or at all 

we have retention programs for workers’ compensation general liability and owned and nonowned automobile liabilities we are generally responsible for up to 10 million per occurrence under these retention programs for workers’ compensation and general liability we are also generally responsible for between 500000 and 30 million per occurrence under these retention programs for owned and nonowned automobile liabilities total insurance limits under these retention programs vary depending upon the period covered and range up to 1100 million per occurrence for general liability and owned and nonowned automobile liabilities and up to the applicable statutory limits for workers’ compensation these insurance policies may not be adequate to protect us from liabilities that we incur in our business in addition in the future our insurance premiums may increase and we may not be able to obtain similar levels of insurance on reasonable terms or at all any such inadequacy of or inability to obtain insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our annual and quarterly financial results are subject to significant fluctuations depending on various factors many of which are beyond our control and if we fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors our share price may decline significantly 

our sales and operating results can vary significantly from quartertoquarter and yeartoyear depending on various factors many of which are beyond our control these factors include among other things 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 as a result our operational performance may decline quickly and significantly in response to changes in order patterns or rapid decreases in demand for our products we anticipate that fluctuations in operating results will continue in the future 

 

our common stock price could be subject to significant fluctuations andor may decline 

the market price of our common stock could be subject to significant fluctuations among the factors that could affect our stock price are 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 the stock markets in general have experienced volatility that has sometimes been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies these broad market fluctuations may cause the trading price of our common stock to decline 

our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our business and limit our ability to plan for or respond to changes in our business 

we have a substantial amount of indebtedness as of january 1 2017 our consolidated longterm indebtedness was approximately 219 billion we may also incur additional debt which would not be prohibited under the terms of our current securitized debt agreements our substantial indebtedness could have important consequences to our business and our shareholders for example it could 

 

  

  

  

 in addition the financial and other covenants we agreed to with our lenders may limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness make investments pay dividends and engage in other transactions and the leverage may cause potential lenders to be less willing to loan funds to us in the future our failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default that if not cured or waived could result in the acceleration of repayment of all of our indebtedness 

we may be unable to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our significant debt service obligations which would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

our ability to make principal and interest payments on and to refinance our indebtedness will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future this to a certain extent is subject to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control if our business does not generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the amounts projected or at all or if future borrowings are not available to us under our variable funding notes in amounts sufficient to fund our other liquidity needs our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected if we cannot generate sufficient cash flow from operations to make scheduled principal amortization and interest payments on our debt obligations in the future we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity sell assets delay capital expenditures or seek additional equity if we are unable to refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all or to effect any other action relating to our indebtedness on satisfactory terms or at all our business may be harmed 

 

the terms of our securitized debt financing of certain of our whollyowned subsidiaries have restrictive terms and our failure to comply with any of these terms could put us in default which would have an adverse effect on our business and prospects 

unless and until we repay all outstanding borrowings under our securitized debt we will remain subject to the restrictive terms of these borrowings the securitized debt under which certain of our whollyowned subsidiaries issued and guaranteed fixed rate notes and variable funding senior revolving notes contain a number of covenants with the most significant financial covenant being a debt service coverage calculation these covenants limit the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to among other things 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 the securitized debt also requires us to maintain specified financial ratios at the end of each fiscal quarter these restrictions could affect our ability to pay dividends or repurchase shares of our common stock our ability to meet these financial ratios can be affected by events beyond our control and we may not satisfy such a test a breach of this covenant could result in a rapid amortization event or default under the securitized debt if amounts owed under the securitized debt are accelerated because of a default under the securitized debt and we are unable to pay such amounts the investors may have the right to assume control of substantially all of the securitized assets 

during the term following issuance the outstanding senior notes will accrue interest at fixed rates additionally our senior notes have original scheduled principal payments of 386 million in each of 2017 and 2018 8785 million in 2019 4880 million in 2020 80 million in each of 2021 through 2024 and 7280 million in 2025 in accordance with our debt agreements the payment of principal on the outstanding senior notes i shall be suspended if the leverage ratios for the company are less than or equal to 45x total debt to ebitda and there are no scheduled principal catchup amounts outstanding provided that during any such suspension principal payments will continue to accrue and are subject to catchup upon failure to satisfy the leverage ratios or ii on and after the payment in full of the 2012 fixed rate senior secured notes may be suspended if the leverage ratios for the company are less than or equal to 50x total debt to ebitda and no catch up provisions are applicable 

if we are unable to refinance or repay amounts under the securitized debt prior to the expiration of the term our cash flow would be directed to the repayment of the securitized debt and other than a weekly management fee sufficient to cover minimal selling general and administrative expenses would not be available for operating our business 

no assurance can be given that any refinancing or additional financing will be possible when needed or that we will be able to negotiate acceptable terms in addition our access to capital is affected by prevailing conditions in the financial and capital markets and other factors beyond our control there can be no assurance that market conditions will be favorable at the times that we require new or additional financing 

the indenture governing the securitized debt will restrict the cash flow from the entities subject to the securitization to any of our other entities and upon the occurrence of certain events cash flow would be further restricted 

in the event that a rapid amortization event occurs under the indenture including without limitation upon an event of default under the indenture or the failure to repay the securitized debt at the end of its term the funds available to us would be reduced or eliminated which would in turn reduce our ability to operate or grow our business

our business model is straightforward we handcraft and serve quality food at a competitive price with easy ordering access and efficient service enhanced by our technology innovations our dough is generally made fresh and distributed to stores around the world by us and our franchisees 

domino’s generates revenues and earnings by charging royalties to its franchisees royalties are ongoing percentofsales fees for use of the domino’s brand marks the company also generates revenues and earnings by selling food equipment and supplies to franchisees primarily in the us and canada and by operating a number of our own stores franchisees profit by selling pizza and other complementary items to their local customers in our international markets we generally grant geographical rights to the domino’s pizza ® brand to master franchisees these master franchisees are charged with developing their geographical area and they may profit by subfranchising and selling ingredients and equipment to those subfranchisees as well as by running pizza stores everyone in the system can benefit including the end consumer who can feed their family domino’s menu items conveniently and economically

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of these financial statements requires our management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis our management evaluates its estimates including those related to revenue recognition longlived and intangible assets insurance and legal matters sharebased payments and income taxes we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from those estimates changes in our accounting policies and estimates could materially impact our results of operations and financial condition for any particular period we believe that our most critical accounting policies and estimates are 

revenue recognition  we earn revenues through our network of domestic companyowned and franchised stores dough manufacturing and supply chain centers and international operations retail sales from franchise stores are reported to the company by its franchisees and are not included in company revenues retail sales from companyowned stores and royalty revenues resulting from the retail sales from franchised stores are recognized as revenues when the items are delivered to or carried out by customers retail sales are generally reported and related royalties paid to the company based on a percentage of retail sales as specified in the related standard franchise agreement generally 55 of domestic franchise retail sales and on average 30 of international franchise retail sales revenues from companyowned stores and royalty revenues and fees from franchised stores can fluctuate from timetotime as a result of store count and sales level changes this can occur when a companyowned store is sold to a franchisee if a companyowned store that generated 500000 in revenue in fiscal 2015 was sold to a franchisee in fiscal 2016 revenues from companyowned stores would have declined by 500000 in fiscal 2016 while franchise royalty revenues would have increased by only 27500 in fiscal 2016 as we generally collect 55 of a domestic franchisee’s retail sales sales of food from our supply chain centers are recognized as revenues upon delivery of the food to franchisees while sales of equipment and supplies are generally recognized as revenues upon shipment of the related products to franchisees 

longlived and intangible assets we record longlived assets including property plant and equipment and capitalized software at cost for acquisitions of franchise operations we estimate the fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired based on physical inspection of assets historical experience and other information available to us regarding the acquisition we depreciate and amortize longlived assets using useful lives determined by us based on historical experience and other information available to us we evaluate the potential impairment of longlived assets at least annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable our evaluation is based on various analyses including the projection of undiscounted cash flows for companyowned stores we perform related impairment tests on an operating market basis which the company has determined to be the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of other cash flows if the carrying amount of a longlived asset exceeds the amount of the expected future undiscounted cash flows of that asset the company estimates the fair value of the asset if the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset an impairment loss is recognized and the asset is written down to its estimated fair value 

 

we have not made any significant changes in the methodology used to project the future market cash flows of companyowned stores during the years presented same store sales fluctuations and the rates at which operating costs will fluctuate in the future are key factors in evaluating recoverability of the related assets if our same store sales significantly decline or if operating costs increase and we are unable to recover these costs the carrying value of our companyowned stores by market may be unrecoverable and we may be required to recognize an impairment charge as discussed in note 1 to our consolidated financial statements the company incurred an impairment charge related to its corporate airplane in the fourth quarter of 2014 aside from this impairment charge the company did not record an impairment charge during fiscal 2016 fiscal 2015 or fiscal 2014 

a significant portion of our goodwill relates to acquisitions of domestic franchise stores and is included in our domestic stores segment specifically our companyowned stores division we evaluate goodwill annually for impairment by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit which is primarily determined using the present value of historical cash flows to its carrying value if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value goodwill would be impaired we have not made any significant changes in the methodology used to evaluate goodwill impairment during the years presented at january 1 2017 the fair value of our business operations with associated goodwill exceeded their recorded carrying value including the related goodwill if cash flows generated by our companyowned stores were to decline significantly in the future or there were negative revisions to the market multiple assumption we may be required to recognize a goodwill impairment charge however based on the latest impairment analysis we do not believe it is reasonably likely that there could be changes in assumptions that would trigger impairment 

insurance and legal matters we are a party to lawsuits and legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business management closely monitors these legal matters and estimates the probable costs for the resolution of such matters these estimates are primarily determined by consulting with both internal and external parties handling the matters and are based upon an analysis of potential results assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies legal judgments can be volatile and difficult to predict accordingly if our estimates relating to legal matters proved inaccurate for any reason we may be required to increase or decrease the related expense in future periods we had accruals for legal matters of approximately 27 million at january 1 2017 and 19 million at january 3 2016 

for certain periods prior to december 1998 and for periods after december 2001 we maintain insurance coverage for workers’ compensation general liability and owned and nonowned auto liability under insurance policies requiring payment of a deductible for each occurrence up to between 500000 and 30 million depending on the policy year and line of coverage the related insurance reserves are based on undiscounted independent actuarial estimates which are based on historical information along with assumptions about future events specifically various methods including analyses of historical trends and actuarial valuation methods are utilized to estimate the cost to settle reported claims and claims incurred but not yet reported the actuarial valuation methods develop estimates of the future ultimate claim costs based on the claims incurred as of the balance sheet date when estimating these liabilities several factors are considered including the severity duration and frequency of claims legal cost associated with claims healthcare trends and projected inflation 

our methodology for determining our exposure has remained consistent throughout the years presented management believes that the various assumptions developed and actuarial methods used to determine our selfinsurance reserves are reasonable and provide meaningful data that management uses to make its best estimate of our exposure to these risks changes in assumptions for such factors as medical costs and legal actions as well as changes in actual experience could cause our estimates to change in the near term which could result in an increase or decrease in the related expense in future periods a 10 change in our selfinsurance liability at january 1 2017 would have affected our income before provision for income taxes by approximately 44 million for fiscal 2016 we had accruals for insurance matters of approximately 439 million at january 1 2017 and 409 million at january 3 2016 

sharebased payments we recognize compensation expense related to our sharebased compensation arrangements over the requisite service period based on the grant date fair value of the awards the grant date fair value of each restricted stock and performancebased restricted stock award is equal to the market price of our stock on the date of grant the grant date fair value of each stock option award is estimated using a blackscholes option pricing model the pricing model requires assumptions including the expected life of the stock option the riskfree interest rate the expected dividend yield and expected volatility of our stock over the expected life which significantly impact the assumed fair value historically we have also estimated the expected forfeiture rate and only recognized expense for those awards expected to vest we use historical data to determine these assumptions additionally our stock option restricted stock and performancebased restricted stock arrangements provide for accelerated vesting and the ability to exercise during the remainder of the tenyear stock option life upon the retirement of individuals holding the awards who have achieved specified service and age requirements 

 

management believes that the methods and various assumptions used to determine compensation expense related to these arrangements are reasonable but if the assumptions change significantly for future grants sharebased compensation expense will fluctuate in future years 

income taxes we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities we measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using current enacted tax rates that will apply in the years in which we expect the temporary differences to be recovered or paid judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes related reserves and deferred tax assets and liabilities these include establishing a valuation allowance related to the ability to realize certain deferred tax assets if necessary on an ongoing basis management will assess whether it remains more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets will be realized the company had valuation allowances recorded for deferred tax assets of approximately 01 million as of january 1 2017 and approximately 02 million as of january 3 2016 our accounting for deferred tax assets represents our best estimate of future events our net deferred tax assets assume that we will generate sufficient taxable income in specific tax jurisdictions based on our estimates and assumptions changes in our current estimates due to unanticipated events could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

the amounts recorded on the balance sheet relating to uncertain tax positions consider the ultimate resolution of revenue agent reviews based on estimates and assumptions we believe we have appropriately accounted for our uncertain tax positions however tax audits changes in tax laws and other unforeseen matters may result in us owing additional taxes we adjust our reserves for uncertain tax positions when facts and circumstances change or due to the passage of time the completion of a tax audit or the expiration of a statute of limitations associated with uncertain tax positions are examples of situations when we may adjust our reserves management believes that our tax positions comply with applicable tax law and that we have adequately provided for these matters however to the extent the final tax outcome of these matters is different than our recorded amounts we may be required to adjust our tax reserves resulting in additional income tax expense or benefit in future periods

 2016 compared to 2015

revenues revenues primarily consist of retail sales from our companyowned stores royalties and fees from our domestic and international franchised stores and sales of food equipment and supplies from our supply chain centers to substantially all of our domestic franchised stores and certain international franchised stores companyowned store and franchised store revenues may vary from period to period due to changes in store count mix supply chain revenues may vary significantly as a result of fluctuations in commodity prices as well as the mix of products we sell 

consolidated revenues increased 2561 million or 116 in 2016 the increase was due primarily to higher supply chain food volumes as well as higher companyowned store domestic franchise and international franchise revenues resulting from same store sales and store count growth these increases were offset in part by the inclusion of the 53 rd week in 2015 which positively impacted revenues by an estimated 497 million in 2015 the negative impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on international franchise royalties and international supply chain revenues also partially offset the increases in revenues these changes in revenues are more fully described below 

domestic stores revenues from domestic stores are primarily comprised of retail sales from domestic companyowned store operations as well as royalties from retail sales and other fees from domestic franchised stores as summarized in the following table 

 

 higher franchise same store sales store count growth and higher domestic companyowned same store sales drove an increase in overall domestic store revenues of 816 million or 122 these results are more fully described below 

domestic companyowned stores revenues from domestic companyowned store operations increased 421 million or 106 in 2016 this increase was due to a 104 increase in same store sales as compared to 2015 and an increase in the average number of stores open during the year and was offset in part by the estimated 91 million positive impact in 2015 related to the inclusion of the 53 rd week 

domestic franchise revenues from domestic franchise operations increased 395 million or 145 in 2016 the increase was driven by a 105 increase in same store sales as compared to 2015 and an increase in the average number of stores open during the year revenues further benefited from fees paid by franchisees for our internally developed online ordering platform and were offset in part by the estimated 61 million positive impact in 2015 related to the inclusion of the 53 rd week 

 

supply chain revenues from supply chain operations are primarily comprised of sales of food equipment and supplies from our supply chain centers to substantially all of our domestic franchised stores and certain international franchised stores as summarized in the following table 

 

 in fiscal 2016 the company began managing the alaska and hawaii supply chain centers as part of its domestic supply chain business prior to fiscal 2016 these centers were managed as part of the company’s international supply chain business revenues from these supply chain centers are included in the 2016 and 2015 domestic supply chain revenues in the table above 

domestic supply chain domestic supply chain revenues increased 1424 million or 113 in 2016 these increases were primarily attributable to higher volumes from increased order counts at the store level they were partially offset by lower commodity prices and the estimated 278 million positive impact in 2015 related to the inclusion of the 53 rd week the lower cheese block price passed through directly in domestic supply chain pricing to franchisees did not have a material impact on domestic supply chain revenues in 2016 we estimate that lower commodity prices resulted in an approximate 30 million decrease in domestic supply chain revenues during 2016 

international supply chain revenues from international supply chain operations increased 187 million or 160 in 2016 this increase resulted primarily from higher volumes from increased order counts at the store level in 2016 and was offset in part by the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates of approximately 43 million in 2016 and the estimated 26 million positive impact in 2015 related to the inclusion of the 53 rd week 

international franchise international franchise revenues primarily consist of royalties from retail sales and other fees from our international franchise stores revenues from international franchise operations increased 134 million or 82 in 2016 this increase was due to an increase in the average number of international stores open during 2016 as well as higher same store sales and was offset in part by the negative impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates of approximately 89 million in 2016 and the estimated 41 million positive impact in 2015 related to the inclusion of the 53 rd week excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rates same store sales increased 63 in 2016 compared to 2015 

cost of sales  operating margin consolidated cost of sales consists primarily of domestic companyowned store and supply chain costs incurred to generate related revenues components of consolidated cost of sales primarily include food labor and occupancy costs the changes to the consolidated operating margin which we define as revenues less cost of sales are summarized in the following table 

 

 the 846 million or 124 increase in consolidated operating margin was due primarily to higher domestic and international franchise revenues and higher supply chain margins the increase in the consolidated operating margin was offset in part by the estimated 166 million positive impact in 2015 related to the inclusion of the 53 rd week franchise revenues do not have a cost of sales component so changes in franchise revenues have a disproportionate effect on the consolidated operating margin 

as a percentage of total revenues our consolidated operating margin increased 02 percentage points in 2016 due to higher supply chain margins as a percentage of their revenues and a higher mix of franchise revenues lower companyowned stores operating margins as a percentage of their revenues partially offset these increases these changes are more fully described below 

domestic companyowned stores the changes to domestic companyowned store operating margin which do not include other storelevel costs such as royalties and advertising are summarized in the following table 

 

 the 96 million or 98 increase in the domestic companyowned store operating margin was due primarily to higher same store sales the estimated 31 million positive impact in 2015 related to the inclusion of the 53 rd week partially offset this increase 

 

as a percentage of store revenues the store operating margin decreased 02 percentage points in 2016 as discussed in more detail below 

management has historically included costs to support online ordering as part of labor and related costs costs to support online ordering are now included within transactionrelated expenses and the prior year costs have been reclassified to conform to current year presentation 

 

  

  

  

  

 supply chain the changes to the supply chain operating margin are summarized in the following table 

 

 the 222 million or 149 increase in the supply chain operating margin was due primarily to higher volumes from increased store order counts lower insurance expenses also contributed to the increased operating margin as the third quarter of 2015 contained a 14 million insurance charge related to the company’s casualty insurance program the estimated 33 million positive impact in 2015 related to the inclusion of the 53 rd week in 2015 partially offset the increase in operating margin 

as a percentage of supply chain revenues the supply chain operating margin increased 03 percentage points in 2016 due to lower casualty and health insurance expenses higher volumes from store count growth and increased store order counts as well as lower fuel costs increased labor costs partially offset these increases decreases in certain food prices have a positive effect on the supply chain operating margin percentage due to the fixed dollar margin earned by supply chain on certain food items lower commodity prices decreased both revenues and costs by 30 million in fiscal 2016 lower cheese prices did not have a material impact in 2016 if our us cheese prices for 2016 had been in effect during 2015 the supply chain operating margin as a percentage of supply chain revenues would have remained the same the dollar margin would also have been unaffected 

general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses increased 359 million or 129 in 2016 these increases were driven by continued investments in technological initiatives and labor primarily in ecommerce information technology and international operations as well as higher performancedriven expenses resulting from improved operating performance and higher same store sales including variable performancebased compensation and companyowned store national advertising contributions general and administrative expenses were positively impacted by the nonrecurrence of an estimated 47 million of expenses from the inclusion of the 53 rd week in 2015 

interest income interest income increased slightly to 07 million in 2016 

interest expense interest expense increased 105 million to 1101 million in 2016 the increase was driven by a higher average debt balance as a result of the 2015 recapitalization and was offset in part by a lower cash borrowing rate 

our weighted average borrowing rate decreased to 46 in fiscal 2016 from 51 in fiscal 2015 the decreases in the company’s cash borrowing rate resulted from the lower interest rates on the debt issued as part of the 2015 recapitalization our average outstanding debt balance excluding capital lease obligations was approximately 223 billion in 2016 and approximately 168 billion in 2015 the increase in the average outstanding debt balance was due to the issuance of debt in connection with the 2015 recapitalization 

provision for income taxes provision for income taxes increased 166 million to 1300 million in 2016 due primarily to higher pretax income the company’s effective income tax rate increased by 07 percentage points to 377 of pretax income in 2016

revenues consolidated revenues increased 2227 million or 112 in 2015 the increase was due primarily to higher supply chain food volumes as well as increased sales of equipment to stores in connection with our store reimaging program higher companyowned store domestic franchise and international franchise revenues resulting from same store sales and store count growth also contributed to the rise in revenue the inclusion of the 53 rd week in 2015 also positively impacted revenues by an estimated 497 million these increases were offset in part by the negative impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on international franchise royalties and international supply chain revenues as well as lower cheese and other commodity prices 

these changes in revenues are more fully described below 

domestic stores domestic stores revenues are summarized in the following table 

 

 higher franchise same store sales store count growth and higher domestic companyowned same store sales drove an increase in overall domestic store revenues of 910 million or 157 these results are more fully described below 

domestic companyowned stores revenues from domestic companyowned store operations increased 484 million or 139 in 2015 this increase was due to a 122 increase in same store sales as compared to 2014 as well as an estimated 91 million impact of the 53 rd week offset in part by the sale of 14 companyowned stores to a franchisee that occurred in the first quarter of 2014 

domestic franchise revenues from domestic franchise operations increased 426 million or 185 in 2015 the increase was driven by an 119 increase in same store sales as compared to 2014 as well as an estimated 61 million impact of the 53 rd week and an increase in the average number of domestic franchised stores open during 2015 revenues further benefited from fees paid by franchisees to reimburse us for expenses we incurred for our internally developed online ordering platform 

supply chain supply chain revenues are summarized in the following table 

 

 in fiscal 2016 the company began managing the alaska and hawaii supply chain centers as part of its domestic supply chain business prior to fiscal 2016 these centers were managed as part of the company’s international supply chain business revenues from these supply chain centers are included in the 2015 and 2014 domestic supply chain revenues in the table above 

domestic supply chain domestic supply chain revenues increased 1167 million or 101 in 2015 these increases were primarily attributable to higher volumes from increased order counts at the store level and increases in sales of equipment in connection with our store reimaging program as well as an estimated 278 million impact of the 53 rd week they were partially offset by lower cheese and other commodity prices we estimate that the lower cheese block price passed through directly in domestic supply chain pricing to franchisees resulted in an approximate 453 million decrease in domestic supply chain revenues during 2015 

international supply chain revenues from international supply chain operations increased 40 million or 35 in 2015 this increase resulted primarily from higher volumes in 2015 and an estimated 26 million impact of the 53 rd week and were offset in part by the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates of approximately 164 million in 2015 

international franchise international franchise revenues primarily consist of royalties from retail sales and other fees from our international franchise stores revenues from international franchise operations increased 110 million or 72 in 2015 this increase was due to an increase in the average number of international stores open during 2015 higher same store sales and an estimated 41 million impact of the 53 rd week and was offset in part by the negative impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates of approximately 199 million in 2015 excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rates same store sales increased 78 in 2015 compared to 2014 

 

cost of sales  operating margin the changes to the consolidated operating margin which we define as revenues less cost of sales are summarized in the following table 

 

 the 883 million or 149 increase in consolidated operating margin was due primarily to higher domestic and international franchise revenues and higher supply chain margins as well as an estimated 166 million impact of the 53 rd week franchise revenues do not have a cost of sales component so changes in franchise revenues have a disproportionate effect on the consolidated operating margin 

as a percentage of total revenues our consolidated operating margin increased 10 percentage points in 2015 due to higher supply chain and companyowned stores operating margins as a percentage of their revenues as well as a higher mix of franchise revenues these changes are more fully described below 

domestic companyowned stores the changes to domestic companyowned store operating margin which do not include other storelevel costs such as royalties and advertising are summarized in the following table 

 

 the 165 million or 204 increase in the domestic companyowned store operating margin was due primarily to higher same store sales a decrease in overall commodity prices and an estimated 31 million impact of the 53 rd week 

as a percentage of store revenues the store operating margin increased 13 percentage points in 2015 as discussed in more detail below 

as noted in the comparison between 2016 and 2015 management has historically included costs to support online ordering as part of labor and related costs costs to support online ordering are now included within transactionrelated expenses and the prior year costs below have been reclassified to conform to current year presentation 

 

  

  

  

 supply chain the changes to the supply chain operating margin are summarized in the following table 

 

 the 183 million increase in the supply chain operating margin was due primarily to higher volumes from increased store order counts and an estimated 33 million impact of the 53 rd week 

as a percentage of supply chain revenues the supply chain operating margin increased 04 percentage points in 2015 due to lower commodity prices and lower fuel costs however the operating margin was negatively impacted by incremental casualty and health insurance expense including 14 million recorded in the third quarter of 2015 related to updated actuarial estimates for our casualty insurance program as well as increased labor and delivery costs decreases in certain food prices have a positive effect on the supply chain operating margin percentage due to the fixed dollar margin earned by supply chain on certain food items changes in our us cheese prices decreased both revenues and costs by 453 million in fiscal 2015 if our us cheese prices for 2015 had been in effect during 2014 the supply chain operating margin as a percentage of supply chain revenues would have increased by 04 percentage points however the dollar margin would have been unaffected 

 

general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses increased 283 million or 113 in 2015 these increases were driven by continued investments in technological initiatives and labor primarily in ecommerce information technology and international operations as well as higher volumedriven expenses resulting from improved operating performance and higher same store sales including variable performancebased compensation companyowned store national advertising contributions and franchisee incentives the nonrecurring 17 million pretax gain recognized from the sale of 14 companyowned stores during the first quarter of 2014 and an estimated 47 million impact of the inclusion of the 53 rd week in 2015 also contributed to the increase for fiscal 2015 these increases were offset in part by the nonrecurring 58 million impairment charge in 2014 

interest income interest income increased slightly to 03 million in 2015 

interest expense interest expense increased 126 million to 995 million in 2015 the increase was due primarily to approximately 73 million of expenses incurred in the fourth quarter of 2015 related to the 2015 recapitalization including a 69 million writeoff of debt issuance costs and 04 million of interest expense that was incurred on the 2012 debt subsequent to the closing of the 2015 recapitalization but prior to the repayment of the 2012 debt interest expense also increased due to a higher average debt balance offset in part by a lower average interest rate 

our weighted average borrowing rate decreased to 51 in fiscal 2015 from 53 in fiscal 2014 the decrease in the company’s cash borrowing rate resulted from the lower interest rate on the new debt issued as part of the 2015 recapitalization our average outstanding debt balance excluding capital lease obligations was approximately 168 billion in 2015 and approximately 152 billion in 2014 the increase in the average outstanding debt balance was due to the issuance of debt in connection with the 2015 recapitalization 

provision for income taxes provision for income taxes increased 174 million to 1134 million in 2015 due primarily to higher pretax income the company’s effective income tax rate decreased slightly by 01 percentage points to 370 of pretax income in 2015 

liquidity and capital resources 

historically we have operated with minimal positive working capital or negative working capital primarily because our receivable collection periods and inventory turn rates are faster than the normal payment terms on our current liabilities we generally collect our receivables within three weeks from the date of the related sale and we generally experience 35 to 45 inventory turns per year in addition our sales are not typically seasonal which further limits our working capital requirements these factors coupled with the use of our ongoing cash flows from operations to service our debt obligations invest in our business pay dividends and repurchase our common stock reduce our working capital amounts as of january 1 2017 we had negative working capital of 343 million excluding restricted cash and cash equivalents of 1265 million and including total unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of 428 million 

as of january 1 2017 we had approximately 998 million of restricted cash held for future principal and interest payments and 267 million of restricted cash held in a threemonth interest reserve as required by the related debt agreements for a total of 1265 million of restricted cash and cash equivalents 

the company entered into a recapitalization transaction in 2015 in which certain of our subsidiaries among other things replaced 5513 million of the outstanding series 20121 5216 fixed rate senior secured notes class a2 the “2012 fixed rate notes” and its 2012 variable funding notes with new notes the “2015 fixed rate notes” issued pursuant to an assetbacked securitization the 2015 fixed rate notes consist of 5000 million of series 20151 3484 fixed rate senior secured notes class a2i the “2015 fiveyear notes” 8000 million series 20151 4474 fixed rate senior secured notes class a2ii the “2015 tenyear notes” and 1250 million of series 20151 variable funding senior secured notes class a1 the “2015 variable funding notes” the 2012 fixed rate notes and the 2015 fixed rate notes are referred to collectively as the fixed rate notes additional information related to the 2015 recapitalization transaction is included in note 4 to our consolidated financial statements 

the fixed rate notes have original scheduled principal payments of 386 million in each of 2017 and 2018 8785 million in 2019 4880 million in 2020 80 million in each of 2021 through 2024 and 7280 million in 2025 however in accordance with our debt agreements the payment of principal on the outstanding senior notes i shall be suspended if the leverage ratios are less than or equal to 45x total debt to ebitda and there are no scheduled principal catchup amounts outstanding provided that during any such suspension principal payments will continue to accrue and are subject to catchup upon failure to satisfy the leverage ratios or ii on and after the payment in full of the 2012 fixed rate notes may be suspended if the leverage ratios are less than or equal to 50x total debt to ebitda and no catchup provisions are applicable during the second quarter of 2014 we met the maximum leverage ratios of less than 45x and in accordance with our debt agreements ceased debt amortization payments in the third quarter of 2014 

 

the company continued to meet the maximum leverage ratios of less than 45x in each of the quarters prior to the 2015 recapitalization and accordingly did not make previously scheduled debt amortization payments in accordance with the debt agreements subsequent to the 2015 recapitalization the company’s leverage ratios exceeded 45x and accordingly the company began making the scheduled amortization payments as well as the required catchup payments 

the fixed rate notes are subject to certain financial and nonfinancial covenants including a debt service coverage calculation as defined in the related agreements in the event that certain covenants are not met the fixed rate notes may become due and payable on an accelerated schedule 

a portion of proceeds from the 2015 recapitalization were used to make an optional prepayment of approximately 5513 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2012 fixed rate notes at par pay scheduled principal catchup amounts on the 2012 fixed rate notes make an interest reserve deposit prefund a portion of the principal and interest payable on the 2015 fixed rate notes and pay transaction fees and expenses in connection with the issuance of the 2015 variable funding notes the company permanently reduced to zero the commitment to fund the 2012 variable funding note facility and the 2012 variable funding note facility was cancelled 

in connection with the 2012 recapitalization the company recorded 399 million of debt issuance costs in connection with the 2015 recapitalization the company wrote off approximately 69 million of these costs in connection with the extinguishment of 5513 million of the 2012 fixed rate notes the remaining debt issuance costs related to the 2012 recapitalization are being amortized into interest expense over the sevenyear expected term of the 2012 fixed rate notes additionally in connection with the 2015 recapitalization the company recorded 174 million of debt issuance costs which are being amortized into interest expense over the five and tenyear expected terms of the 2015 fixed rate notes 

during fiscal 2015 and in connection with the 2015 recapitalization the company incurred approximately 81 million of net expenses this consisted primarily of a 69 million net writeoff of debt issuance costs the company also incurred approximately 04 million of interest expense on the 2012 fixed rate notes subsequent to the closing of the 2015 recapitalization but prior to the repayment of the 2012 fixed rate notes resulting in the payment of interest on both the 2012 and 2015 fixed rate notes for a short period of time further the company incurred 09 million of other net 2015 recapitalizationrelated general and administrative expenses including legal and professional fees 

our primary source of liquidity is cash flows from operations and availability of borrowings under our 2015 variable funding notes as of january 1 2017 we had 443 million of outstanding letters of credit and 807 million of available borrowing capacity under our 2015 variable funding notes the letters of credit are primarily related to our casualty insurance programs and supply chain center leases borrowings under the 2015 variable funding notes are available to fund our working capital requirements capital expenditures and subject to other limitations other general corporate purposes including dividend payments 

as part of the 2015 recapitalization on october 23 2015 the company’s board of directors authorized a new share repurchase program to repurchase up to 8000 million of the company’s common stock this repurchase program replaced the remaining availability under the company’s previously disclosed 2000 million share repurchase program on october 27 2015 the company entered into a 6000 million asr agreement with a counterparty 

pursuant to the terms of the asr agreement on october 30 2015 as part of its new 8000 million share repurchase authorization the company used a portion of the proceeds from the 2015 recapitalization to pay the counterparty 6000 million in cash and received approximately 486 million shares of the company’s common stock during the first quarter of 2016 the company received and retired 456936 shares of its common stock in connection with the final settlement of its 6000 million accelerated share repurchase program 

the company’s open market share repurchase program has historically been funded by excess cash flows the company used cash of approximately 3003 million in 2016 and 7386 million in 2015 for share repurchases the company had approximately 1491 million left under the most recent 2500 million authorization as of january 1 2017 we expect to continue to use ongoing excess cash flow generation and subject to certain restrictions in the documents governing the 2015 variable funding notes availability under the 2015 variable funding notes to among other things repurchase shares under the current authorized program 

in the past three years we have invested between 615 million and 718 million annually in capital expenditures in 2016 we invested 615 million in capital expenditures which primarily related to reimaging our existing companyowned stores and investments in our supply chain centers and training facilities our proprietary internally developed pointofsale system domino’s pulse our digital ordering platform our internal enterprise systems and other technology initiatives we did not have any material commitments for capital expenditures as of january 1 2017 

 

the following table illustrates the main components of our cash flows 

 

 operating activities 

cash provided by operating activities was 2873 million in fiscal 2016 our cash provided by operating activities was mainly the result of net income of 2147 million which included noncash amounts of 126 million the changes in operating assets and liabilities also generated 600 million of cash inflows during 2016 

during fiscal 2015 cash provided by operating activities was 2918 million mainly the result of net income of 1928 million which included noncash amounts of 456 million the changes in operating assets and liabilities also generated 534 million of cash inflows during 2015 

cash provided by operating activities was 1923 million in fiscal 2014 our cash provided by operating activities was mainly the result of net income of 1626 million which included 297 million of noncash amounts 

we are focused on continually improving our net income and cash flow from operations and management expects to continue to generate positive cash flows from operating activities for the foreseeable future 

investing activities 

during fiscal 2016 cash used in investing activities was 08 million which consisted primarily of 586 million of capital expenditures driven by investments related to the reimaging of our existing companyowned stores and investments in our supply chain centers and training facilities our proprietary internally developed pointofsale system our digital ordering platform our internal enterprise systems and other technology initiatives offset in part by the change in restricted cash of 544 million and by proceeds from the sale of assets of 49 million 

during fiscal 2015 cash used in investing activities was 1093 million which consisted primarily of 633 million of capital expenditures driven by investments related to the reimaging of our existing companyowned stores and investments in our supply chain centers and training facilities our proprietary internally developed pointofsale system our digital ordering platform our internal enterprise systems and other technology initiatives change in restricted cash of 600 million and offset by proceeds from the sale of assets of 127 million 

cash used in investing activities was 574 million in fiscal 2014 the main drivers of this change were 701 million of capital expenditures offset by 92 million of proceeds from the sale of assets and the net change in restricted cash and cash equivalents of 45 million 

financing activities 

during fiscal 2016 cash used in financing activities was 3758 million purchases of common stock totaled 3003 million repayments of longterm debt and capital lease obligations totaled 1223 million and funding dividend payments to our shareholders totaled 739 million the net tax impact of equitybased compensation was 425 million proceeds from issuance of debt from our draws on our variable funding note facility totaled 630 million and proceeds from the exercise of stock options totaled 152 million 

during fiscal 2015 cash used in financing activities was 809 million in fiscal 2015 we issued 13 billion of debt in connection with our 2015 recapitalization which was offset by the purchases of common stock of 7386 million repayments of longterm debt of 5644 million of which 5513 million was an optional prepayment on our 2012 fixed rate notes using a portion of the proceeds received from the 2015 recapitalization funding dividend payments to our shareholders of 803 million and cash paid for financing costs related to our 2015 recapitalization of 174 million the net tax impact of equitybased compensation of 103 million increased cash from financing activities in fiscal 2015 

we used 1189 million of cash in financing activities in fiscal 2014 related to purchases of common stock funding dividend payments to our shareholders and making payments on our longterm debt obligations the tax impact of equitybased compensation offset the use of cash in financing activities in both fiscal 2014 

 

during fiscal 2016 we experienced increases in both domestic and international same store sales and both our domestic and international businesses grew their number of stores these factors have contributed to our continued ability to generate positive operating cash flows we expect to use our unrestricted cash and cash equivalents ongoing cash flows from operations and available borrowings under the 2015 variable funding notes to among other things fund working capital requirements invest in our core business pay dividends and repurchase our common stock based upon the current level of operations and anticipated growth we believe that the cash generated from operations our current unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and amounts available under the 2015 variable funding notes will be more than adequate to meet our anticipated debt service requirements capital expenditures dividend payments and working capital needs for the foreseeable future 

our ability to continue to fund these items and continue to reduce debt could be adversely affected by the occurrence of any of the events described in item 1a risk factors there can be no assurance that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operations or that future borrowings will be available under the 2015 variable funding notes or otherwise to enable us to service our indebtedness or to make anticipated capital expenditures our future operating performance and our ability to service extend or refinance the fixed rate notes and to service extend or refinance the 2015 variable funding notes will be subject to future economic conditions and to financial business and other factors many of which are beyond our control 

impact of inflation 

we believe that our results of operations are not materially impacted by moderate changes in the inflation rate inflation did not have a material impact on our operations in 2016 2015 or 2014 severe increases in inflation however could affect the global and us economies and could have an adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations further discussion on the impact of commodities and other cost pressures is included above as well as in item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend market risk 

we do not engage in speculative transactions nor do we hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes in connection with the 2015 recapitalization we issued fixed rate notes and at january 1 2017 we are only exposed to interest rate risk on borrowings under our 2015 variable funding notes as of january 1 2017 we had no outstanding borrowings under our 2015 variable funding notes our fixed rate debt exposes the company to changes in market interest rates reflected in the fair value of the debt and to the risk that the company may need to refinance maturing debt with new debt at a higher rate 

we are exposed to market risks from changes in commodity prices during the normal course of business we purchase cheese and certain other food products that are affected by changes in commodity prices and as a result we are subject to volatility in our food costs we may periodically enter into financial instruments to manage this risk we do not engage in speculative transactions nor do we hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes in instances when we use fixed pricing agreements with our suppliers these agreements cover our physical commodity needs are not netsettled and are accounted for as normal purchases 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

we have exposure to various foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations for revenues generated by our operations outside the united states which can adversely impact our net income and cash flows approximately 72 of our total revenues in 2016 74 of our total revenues in 2015 and 77 of our total revenues in 2014 were derived from our international franchise segment a majority of which were denominated in foreign currencies we also operate dough manufacturing and distribution facilities in canada which generate revenues denominated in canadian dollars we do not enter into financial instruments to manage this foreign currency exchange risk a hypothetical 10 adverse change in the foreign currency rates for our international markets would have resulted in a negative impact on royalty revenues of approximately 167 million in 2016

 item 1 business 

overview 

domino’s is the second largest pizza restaurant chain in the world with more than 12500 locations in over 80 markets around the world founded in 1960 our roots are in convenient pizza delivery while a significant amount of our sales also come from carryout customers although we are a highlyrecognized global brand we focus on serving the local neighborhoods in which we live and do business through our large network of franchise owners and companyowned stores on average we sell more than 15 million pizzas each day throughout our global system 

our business model is straightforward we handcraft and serve quality food at a competitive price with easy ordering access and efficient service enhanced by our technology innovations our dough is generally made fresh and distributed to stores around the world by us and our franchisees 

domino’s generates revenues and earnings by charging royalties to its franchisees royalties are ongoing percentofsales fees for use of the domino’s brand marks the company also generates revenues and earnings by selling food equipment and supplies to franchisees primarily in the us and canada and by operating a number of our own stores franchisees profit by selling pizza and other complementary items to their local customers in our international markets we generally grant geographical rights to the domino’s pizza ® brand to master franchisees these master franchisees are charged with developing their geographical area and they may profit by subfranchising and selling ingredients and equipment to those subfranchisees as well as by running pizza stores everyone in the system can benefit including the end consumer who can feed their family domino’s menu items conveniently and economically 

our business model can yield strong returns for our franchise owners and companyowned stores it can also yield significant cash flow to us through a consistent franchise royalty payment and supply chain revenue stream with moderate capital expenditures we have historically returned cash to shareholders through dividend payments and share buybacks since becoming a publiclytraded company

our history 

we pioneered the pizza delivery business and built domino’s pizza ® into one of the most widelyrecognized consumer brands in the world we have been delivering quality affordable food to our customers since 1960 when brothers thomas and james monaghan borrowed 900 to purchase a small pizza store in ypsilanti michigan thomas purchased his brother’s share of the business shortly thereafter concentrating first on building stores near college campuses and military bases in the 1960s and 1970s the brand grew quickly in the 1980s in urban markets and near residential communities we became “domino’s pizza” in 1965 and opened our first franchised store in 1967 the first international stores opened in 1983 in canada and australia 

monaghan sold 93 of his economic stake in the company in 1998 to bain capital llc then sold and transferred his remaining stake in the company in 2004 when we completed our initial public offering 

since 1998 the company has been structured with a leveraged balance sheet and has completed a number of recapitalization events the company’s most recent recapitalization transaction in 2015 the “2015 recapitalization” primarily consisted of the issuance of 13 billion of fixed rate notes and the repurchase and retirement of 551 million of previously outstanding fixed rate notes following the 2015 recapitalization and including debt from its previous recapitalization in 2012 the “2012 recapitalization” the company had 224 billion in longterm debt 

we relaunched our brand in the us in late 2009 by introducing a new recipe for our core pizza product since 2008 the majority of our menu has changed either through the improvement of existing products or the introduction of new products such as our handmade pan pizza and specialty chicken during this time frame we also began expanding our focus on technology through our development of innovative ordering platforms and other technological advancements globally we opened our 10000 th store in 2012 our 11000 th store in 2014 and our 12000 th store in 2015 in 2013 we announced a plan requiring all stores to adopt our new “pizza theater” store design which is more inviting to customers and allows them to see their orders being made fresh in front of them our goal is to be substantially complete with these remodels by the end of 2017 

 

our industry 

the us qsr pizza category is large and fragmented from 2005 through 2015 the us qsr pizza category has grown from 315 billion to 338 billion it is the thirdlargest category within the 2730 billion us qsr sector the us qsr pizza category is primarily comprised of delivery dinein and carryout 

in the us we compete primarily in the delivery and carryout segments of the pizza industry we are the market share leader in the delivery segment and we have the second largest share in the carryout segment delivery segment sales of 97 billion in 2015 down from 111 billion in 2005 account for approximately 29 of total us qsr pizza the delivery segment declined during the period from 2005 to 2012 and has increased slightly since 2012 from 96 billion in 2012 to 97 billion in 2015 the three industry leaders including domino’s account for approximately 58 of us pizza delivery based on reported consumer spending with the remaining sales going to regional chains and independent establishments from 2005 to 2015 the carryout segment grew from 129 billion to 156 billion the four industry leaders including domino’s account for approximately 42 of the carryout segment 

in contrast to the us international pizza delivery is relatively underdeveloped with only domino’s and two other competitors having a significant global presence we believe that demand for pizza and pizza delivery is large and growing throughout the world driven by international consumers’ increasing emphasis on convenience and the proven success of our 30 years of conducting business abroad 

our competition 

the global pizza delivery and carryout segments are highly competitive in the us we compete against regional and local companies as well as national chains pizza hut ®  papa john’s ® and little caesars pizza ®  internationally we compete primarily with pizza hut ®  papa john’s ® and countryspecific national and local pizzerias we generally compete on the basis of product quality location image service technology and price our business and those of our competitors can be affected by changes in consumer tastes economic conditions demographic trends and consumers’ disposable income we compete not only for customers but also for employees suitable real estate sites and qualified franchisees 

our customers 

the company’s business is not dependent upon a single retail customer or small group of customers including franchisees no customer accounted for more than 10 of total consolidated revenues in 2015 2014 or 2013 our largest franchisee based on store count domino’s pizza enterprises asx dmp operates 1561 stores in six international markets and accounts for 12 of our total store count revenues from this master franchisee accounted for 14 of our consolidated revenues in 2015 our international business unit only requires a minimal amount of general and administrative expenses to operate its markets and does not have costs of sales therefore the vast majority of these royalty revenues result in profits to us 

our menu 

we offer a menu designed to present an attractive quality offering to customers while keeping it simple enough to minimize order errors and expedite ordertaking and food preparation our basic menu features pizza products with varying sizes and crust types our typical store also offers ovenbaked sandwiches pasta boneless chicken and wings bread side items desserts and cocacola ® soft drink products international markets vary toppings by country and culture such as squid topping in japan or spicy cheese in india and often feature regional specialty items such as a banana and cinnamon dessert pizza in brazil 

store image and operations 

we have been focused primarily on pizza delivery for over 50 years as well as carryout as a significant component of our business in 2012 we introduced our carryoutfriendly pizza theater store design we expect that substantially all of our stores will convert to this design by the end of 2017 many stores will offer casual seating and will enable customers to watch the preparation of their orders but will not offer a fullservice dinein experience as a result our stores generally do not require expensive restaurant facilities and staffing 

research and development 

we conduct research and product development at our world resource center in ann arbor michigan companysponsored research and development activities which include testing new products for possible menu additions are an important activity for us and our franchisees we do not consider the amounts spent on research and development to be material 

 

our business segments 

we operate in and report three business segments domestic stores international franchise and supply chain 

domestic stores 

our domestic stores segment consists primarily of our franchise operations through which we oversee a network of 4816 franchised stores located in the contiguous united states we also operate a network of 384 domestic companyowned stores located in the contiguous united states 

during 2015 our domestic stores segment accounted for 6697 million or 30 of our consolidated revenues we use our companyowned stores as test sites for new products and promotions as well as operational improvements we also use them for training new store managers and operations team members as well as developing prospective franchisees while we are primarily a franchised business we continuously evaluate our mix of domestic companyowned and franchise stores 

we maintain a productive relationship with our independent franchise owners through regional franchise teams distributing materials that help franchise stores comply with our standards and using franchise advisory groups that facilitate communications between us and our franchisees 

domestic franchise profile 

as of january 3 2016 our 4816 domestic franchise stores were owned and operated by 841 domestic franchisees our franchise formula enables franchisees to benefit from our brand name with a relatively low initial capital investment as of january 3 2016 the average domestic franchisee owned and operated six stores and had been in our franchise system for over 17 years at the same time 13 of our domestic franchisees operated more than 50 stores including our largest domestic franchisee who operated 191 stores and 303 of our domestic franchisees each operated one store 

we apply rigorous standards to prospective domestic franchisees we generally require them to manage a store for at least one year before being granted a franchise this enables us to observe the operational and financial performance of a potential franchisee prior to entering into a longterm contract approximately 90 of our 841 independent domestic franchise owners started their careers with us as delivery drivers or in other instore positions we generally restrict the ability of domestic franchisees to be involved in other businesses which focuses our franchisees’ attention on operating their stores as a result the majority of our domestic franchisees have historically come from within the domino’s pizza system we believe these standards are largely unique to the franchise industry and result in qualified and focused franchisees operating their stores 

domestic franchise agreements 

we enter into franchise agreements with domestic franchisees under which the franchisee is granted the right to operate a store in a particular location for a term of ten years with an ability to renew for an additional term of ten years we have a franchise contract renewal rate of approximately 99 under the current standard franchise agreement we assign an exclusive area of primary responsibility to each franchised store each franchisee is generally required to pay a 55 royalty fee on sales in certain instances we will collect lower rates based on area development agreements sales initiatives and new store incentives 

our domestic stores currently contribute 6 of their retail sales to fund national marketing and advertising campaigns subject in limited instances to lower rates based on certain incentives and waivers these funds are administered by domino’s national advertising fund inc “dnaf” our notforprofit advertising subsidiary the funds are primarily used to purchase media for advertising but also support market research field communications public relations commercial production talent payments and other activities to promote the brand in addition to the national and marketlevel advertising contributions domestic stores spend additional funds on local store marketing activities 

we have the contractual right subject to state law to terminate a franchise agreement for a variety of reasons including but not limited to a franchisee’s failure to adhere to the company’s franchise agreement failure to make required payments or failure to adhere to specified company policies and standards 

 

international franchise 

our international franchise segment is comprised of a network of franchised stores in more than 80 international markets at january 3 2016 we had 7330 international franchise stores during 2015 this segment accounted for 1636 million or 7 of our consolidated revenues the principal sources of revenues from those operations are royalty payments generated by retail sales from franchised stores 

our international franchisees employ our basic standard operating model and adapt it to satisfy the local eating habits and consumer preferences of various regions outside the united states currently the vast majority of our international stores operate under master franchise agreements 

we believe domino’s appeals to potential international franchisees because of our recognized brand name and technological leadership the moderate capital expenditures required to open and operate our stores and our system’s favorable store economics in our top ten markets four master franchise companies are publicly traded on stock exchanges in australia asx dmp india jublfood ns mexico alsea mx and the united kingdom dom l the following table shows our store count as of january 3 2016 in our top ten international markets which account for approximately 71 of our international stores

the vast majority of our markets outside of the contiguous united states are operated by master franchisees with franchise and distribution rights for entire regions or countries in a few select markets we franchise directly to individual store operators prospective master franchisees are required to possess local market knowledge to establish and develop domino’s pizza stores with the ability to identify and access targeted real estate sites as well as expertise in local laws customs culture and consumer behavior we also seek candidates that have access to sufficient capital to meet growth and development plans 

master franchise agreements 

our master franchise agreements generally grant the franchisee exclusive rights to develop or subfranchise stores and the right to operate supply chain centers in particular geographic areas agreements are generally for a term of ten to 20 years with options to renew for additional terms the agreements typically contain growth clauses requiring franchisees to open a minimum number of stores within a specified period the master franchisee is generally required to pay an initial onetime franchise fee as well as an additional franchise fee upon the opening of each new store the master franchisee is also required to pay a continuing royalty fee as a percentage of retail sales which varies among international markets and averaged approximately 31 in 2015 

supply chain 

our supply chain segment operates 18 regional dough manufacturing and food supply chain centers in the us one thin crust manufacturing center one vegetable processing center and one center providing equipment and supplies to certain of our domestic and international stores we also operate five dough manufacturing and food supply chain centers in canada our supply chain segment leases a fleet of more than 500 tractors and trailers during 2015 our supply chain segment accounted for 138 billion or 62 of our consolidated revenues 

 

our centers produce fresh dough and purchase receive store and deliver quality food and other complementary items to over 99 of our us and canadian franchised stores and all of our companyowned stores we regularly supply over 5600 stores with various food and supplies our supply chain segment made approximately 581000 fullservice deliveries in 2015 or approximately two deliveries per store per week and we produced over 415 million pounds of dough during 2015 

we believe our franchisees voluntarily choose to obtain food supplies and equipment from us because we offer the most efficient convenient and costeffective alternative while also offering both quality and consistency our supply chain segment offers profitsharing arrangements to franchisees who purchase all of their food for their stores from our centers these profitsharing arrangements generally offer participating franchisees and companyowned stores with 50 or a higher percentage in the case of companyowned stores and certain franchisees who operate a larger number of stores of their regional supply chain center’s pretax profits we believe these arrangements strengthen our ties and provide aligned benefits with franchisees 

thirdparty suppliers 

over half of our annual food spend is with suppliers where we have maintained a partnership of at least 20 years our supply partners are required to meet strict quality standards to ensure food safety we review and evaluate these partners’ quality assurance programs through among other actions onsite visits third party audits and product evaluations to ensure compliance with our standards we believe the length and quality of our relationships with thirdparty suppliers provides us with priority service and quality products at competitive prices 

cheese is our largest food cost the price we charge to our domestic franchisees for cheese is based on the chicago mercantile exchange cheddar block price plus a supply chain markup as cheese prices fluctuate our revenues and margin percentages in our supply chain segment also fluctuate however actual supply chain dollar margins remain unchanged we currently purchase our domestic pizza cheese from a single supplier under the september 2012 agreement our domestic supplier agreed to provide an uninterrupted supply of cheese and the company agreed to a fiveyear pricing schedule to purchase all of its domestic pizza cheese from this supplier while we expect to meet the terms of this agreement if we do not we will be required to repay the cost savings as outlined in the agreement the majority of our meat toppings in the us come from a single supplier under a contract that began in november 2015 and expires in december 2016 we have the right to terminate these arrangements for quality failures and for uncured breaches 

we are party to a multiyear agreement with cocacola for the contiguous united states this contract renegotiated in december 2013 provides for cocacola to continue to be our exclusive beverage supplier and expires on december 31 2018 or at such time as a minimum number of cases of cocacola products are purchased by us whichever occurs later 

we believe alternative thirdparty suppliers are available for all of these referenced products while we may incur additional costs if we are required to replace any of our supply partners we do not believe such additional costs would have a material adverse effect on our business we continually evaluate each supply category to determine the optimal sourcing strategy 

we have not experienced any significant shortages of supplies or delays in receiving our inventories or products prices charged to us by our supply partners are subject to fluctuation and we have historically been able to pass increased costs and savings on to our stores we periodically enter into supplier contracts to manage the risk from changes in commodity prices we do not engage in speculative transactions nor do we hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes 

our strengths 

strong brand equity 

we are the second largest pizza company in the world we believe our domino’s pizza ® brand is one of the most widelyrecognized consumer brands in the world we are the recognized world leader in pizza delivery and have a significant business in carryout we believe consumers associate our brand with the timely delivery of quality affordable food 

over the past five years our us franchise and companyowned stores have invested an estimated 15 billion in national cooperative and local advertising our international franchisees also invest significant amounts in advertising efforts in their markets we continue to reinforce our brand with extensive advertising through various media channels we have also enhanced the strength of our brand through marketing affiliations with brands such as cocacola 

 

we are the number one pizza delivery company in the united states with a 280 share of pizza delivery based on reported consumer spending with 5200 stores located in the contiguous united states our store delivery areas cover a majority of us households our share position and scale allow us to leverage our purchasing power supply chain strength and marketing investments we believe our scale and market coverage allow us to effectively serve our customers’ demands for convenience and timely delivery outside the us we have significant market share positions in many of the markets in which we compete 

strong and proven business model 

our business model is comprised of domestic and international franchise royalties and fees revenue from supply chain and revenue from retail sales at companyowned stores we have developed this model over our many years of operation and it is anchored by strong storelevel economics which provide an entrepreneurial incentive for our franchisees and historically has generated demand for new stores our franchise system in turn has produced strong and consistent earnings for us through royalty payments and through supply chain revenues with moderate associated capital expenditures by us 

we developed a costefficient store model characterized by a delivery and carryoutoriented store design with moderate capital requirements and a menu of quality affordable items at the store level we believe the simplicity and efficiency of our operations give us significant advantages over our competitors who in many cases also focus on dinein or have broader menu offerings at the supply chain level we believe we provide quality and consistency for our franchise customers while also driving profits for us which we share with our franchisees 

our menu simplifies and streamlines production and delivery processes and maximizes economies of scale on purchases of our principal food items in addition our stores are small historically averaging approximately 1500 square feet and less expensive to build furnish and maintain as compared to many other restaurant concepts although new stores built in our pizza theater design may be slightly larger than stores we have built in the past they are still generally smaller and less expensive than many other restaurant concepts the combination of this efficient store model and strong sales volume has resulted in strong storelevel financial returns and we believe makes domino’s pizza an attractive business opportunity for existing and prospective franchisees around the world 

we believe our store economics have led to a strong welldiversified franchise system this established franchise system has produced strong cash flow and earnings for us enabling us to invest in the domino’s pizza ® brand stores technology and supply chain centers pay significant dividends repurchase and retire shares of our common stock and repurchase and retire outstanding principal on our fixed rate notes 

technological innovation 

technological innovation is vital to our brand and our longterm success digital ordering is critical to competing in the global pizza industry in 2015 approximately 50 of our us sales came via digital platforms that metric is higher in some of our international markets we believe we are among the largest ecommerce retailers in terms of annual transactions after launching digital ordering domestically in 2008 we made the strategic decision in 2010 to develop our own online ordering platform and to manage this important and growing area of our business internally over the next five years we launched mobile applications that cover 95 of the smartphones and tablets on the us market in 2013 we launched an enhanced online ordering profiles platform allowing customers the ability to reorder their favorite order in as few as five clicks or 30 seconds in 2014 we introduced “dom” a voice ordering application which we believe is the first in the restaurant industry and we also made the domino’s tracker ® available on the pebble smartwatch platform in 2015 we introduced several innovative ordering platforms including samsung smart tv ®  twitter and text message using a pizza emoji 

during 2015 the company also launched its “piece of the pie rewards” loyalty program which is meant to reward customers with a program that is simple to understand and easy to use upon signing up for the program customers become rewards members and can earn points for online orders when rewards members reach a certain amount of points they can redeem their points for free pizza rewards members may also receive exclusive membersonly discounts and bonus offers 

all of this improved functionality has been developed to work seamlessly with our domino’s pulse™ pointofsale system our domino’s pulse system is designed to improve operating efficiencies for our franchisees and our corporate management and assist franchisees in independently managing their business we have installed domino’s pulse in every companyowned store in the us in more than 99 of our domestic franchised stores and in nearly 60 of our international stores 

we believe utilizing domino’s pulse with our integrated technology solutions throughout our system provides us with competitive advantages over other concepts we intend to continue to enhance and grow our online ordering digital marketing and technological capabilities 

 

product innovation 

in late 2009 we reintroduced our core pizza with a new recipe which we believe has been key to our continued growth in customer reorder rate consumer traffic and increased sales this recipe is now in use in the vast majority of markets around the world our more than 50 years of innovation have resulted in numerous new product developments including our more recent innovations of handmade pan pizza specialty chicken parmesan bread bites stuffed cheesy bread and marbled cookie brownie among others product innovation is also present in our global markets where our master franchisees have the ability to recommend products to suit their local market tastes products include the mayo jaga in japan bacon potatoes and sweet mayonnaise and the saumoneta in france light cream potatoes onions smoked salmon and dill 

internal dough manufacturing and supply chain system 

in addition to generating significant revenues and earnings in the united states and canada we believe our vertically integrated dough manufacturing and supply chain system enhances the quality and consistency of our products enhances our relationships with franchisees and leverages economies of scale to offer lower costs to our stores it also allows store managers to better focus on store operations and customer service by relieving them of the responsibility of mixing dough in the stores and sourcing other ingredients many of our international master franchisees also profit from running supply chain businesses 

our ideals 

we believe in opportunity hard work inspired solutions winning together embracing community and uncommon honesty 

opportunity abounds at domino’s you can start in an entrylevel position and become a store owner – in fact 90 of our independent domestic franchise owners started their careers with us as delivery drivers or in other instore positions thousands of other team members – supervisors trainers quality auditors international business consultants marketers and executives – also began their careers in the stores internal growth and providing opportunities for anyone willing to work hard is the foundation of our core beliefs 

the ideals of inspired solutions uncommon honesty and winning together were driving forces behind the relaunch of our brand we were inspired by our harshest critics when it came to the perceived taste of our pizza our solution was not simply more advertising the solution was to create a new recipe and a broader menu of greattasting products our marketing campaign was shockingly honest in its approach telling consumers and showing them via television ads that we heard their negative feedback and were listening and without the buyin from our franchise owners we couldn’t have done it we believe that we can’t focus solely on the company’s success we must focus on making our stores and our franchisees successful that’s winning together 

community involvement 

we believe in supporting the communities we serve through donating our time money and pizza you can find more information about our community giving at bizdominoscom  here are two organizations worthy of note

 item 1a risk factors 

the quick service restaurant pizza category is highly competitive and such competition could adversely affect our operating results 

in the us we compete against regional and local companies as well as national chains pizza hut ®  papa john’s ® and little caesars pizza ®  internationally we compete primarily with pizza hut ®  papa john’s ® and countryspecific national and local pizzerias we could experience increased competition from existing or new companies in the pizza category which could create increasing pressures to grow our business in order to maintain our market share if we are unable to maintain our competitive position we could experience downward pressure on prices lower demand for our products reduced margins the inability to take advantage of new business opportunities and the loss of market share all of which would have an adverse effect on our operating results and could cause our stock price to decline 

we also compete on a broader scale with quick service and other international national regional and local restaurants the overall food service market and the quick service restaurant sector are intensely competitive with respect to food quality price service image convenience and concept and are often affected by changes in 

 

  

  

  

  

 we compete within the food service market and the quick service restaurant sector not only for customers but also for management and hourly employees suitable real estate sites and qualified franchisees our supply chain segment is also subject to competition from outside suppliers while over 99 of domestic franchisees purchased food equipment and supplies from us in 2015 domestic franchisees are not required to purchase food equipment or supplies from us and they may choose to purchase from outside suppliers if other suppliers who meet our qualification standards were to offer lower prices or better service to our franchisees for their ingredients and supplies and as a result our franchisees chose not to purchase from our domestic supply chain centers our financial condition business and results of operations would be adversely affected 

if we fail to successfully implement our growth strategy which includes opening new domestic and international stores our ability to increase our revenues and operating profits could be adversely affected 

a significant component of our growth strategy includes the opening of new domestic and international stores we and our franchisees face many challenges in opening new stores including among others 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 the opening of additional franchise stores also depends in part upon the availability of prospective franchisees who meet our criteria our failure to add a significant number of new stores would adversely affect our ability to increase revenues and operating income 

we and our franchisees are currently planning to expand our international operations in many of the markets where we currently operate and in select new markets this may require considerable management time as well as startup expenses for market development before any significant revenues and earnings are generated operations in new foreign markets may achieve low margins or may be unprofitable and expansion in existing markets may be affected by local economic and market conditions therefore as we expand internationally we or our franchisees may not experience the operating margins we expect our results of operations may be negatively impacted and our common stock price may decline 

we may also pursue strategic acquisitions as part of our business if we are able to identify acquisition candidates such acquisitions may be financed to the extent permitted under our debt agreements with substantial debt or with potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities 

 

the food service market is affected by consumer preferences and perceptions changes in these preferences and perceptions may lessen the demand for our products which would reduce sales and harm our business 

food service businesses are affected by changes in consumer tastes international national regional and local economic conditions and demographic trends for instance if prevailing health or dietary preferences cause consumers to avoid pizza and other products we offer in favor of foods that are perceived as more healthy our business and operating results would be harmed moreover because we are primarily dependent on a single product if consumer demand for pizza should decrease our business would suffer more than if we had a more diversified menu as many other food service businesses do 

reports of foodborne illness or food tampering could reduce sales and harm our business 

reports whether true or not of foodborne illnesses such as e coli avian flu bovine spongiform encephalopathy hepatitis a trichinosis or salmonella and injuries caused by food tampering have in the past severely injured the reputations of participants in the qsr sector and could in the future as well the potential for acts of terrorism on our global food supply also exists and if such an event occurs it could have a negative impact on us and could severely hurt sales and profits in addition our reputation is an important asset as a result anything that damages our reputation could immediately and severely affect our sales and profits media reports of illnesses and injuries whether accurate or not could force some stores to close or otherwise reduce sales at such stores in addition reports of foodborne illnesses or food tampering even those occurring solely at the restaurants of competitors could by resulting in negative publicity about the restaurant industry adversely affect us on a local regional national or international basis 

increases in food labor and other costs could adversely affect our profitability and operating results 

an increase in our operating costs could adversely affect our profitability factors such as inflation increased food costs increased labor and employee health and benefit costs increased rent costs and increased energy costs may adversely affect our operating costs most of the factors affecting costs are beyond our control and in many cases we may not be able to pass along these increased costs to our customers or franchisees most ingredients used in our pizza particularly cheese are subject to significant price fluctuations as a result of seasonality weather demand and other factors the cheese block price per pound averaged 162 in 2015 and the estimated increase in companyowned store food costs from a hypothetical 025 adverse change in the average cheese block price per pound would have been approximately 22 million in 2015 labor costs are largely a function of the minimum wage for a majority of our store personnel and certain supply chain center personnel and generally are also a function of the availability of labor labor costs and food costs including cheese represent approximately 50 to 60 of the sales at a typical companyowned store 

we do not have longterm contracts with certain of our suppliers and as a result they could seek to significantly increase prices or fail to deliver 

we do not have longterm contracts or arrangements with certain of our suppliers although in the past we have not experienced significant problems with our suppliers our suppliers may implement significant price increases or may not meet our requirements in a timely fashion or at all the occurrence of any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

shortages or interruptions in the supply or delivery of fresh food products could adversely affect our operating results 

we and our franchisees are dependent on frequent deliveries of food products that meet our specifications in addition the company has single suppliers or a limited number of suppliers for certain of its ingredients including pizza cheese while the company believes there are adequate reserve quantities and potential alternative suppliers shortages or interruptions in the supply of food products caused by unanticipated demand problems in production or distribution financial or other difficulties of suppliers inclement weather or other conditions could adversely affect the availability quality and cost of ingredients could adversely affect our operating results 

any prolonged disruption in the operations of any of our dough manufacturing and supply chain centers could harm our business 

we operate 18 regional dough manufacturing and supply chain centers one thin crust manufacturing center and one vegetable processing center in the united states and five dough manufacturing and supply chain centers in canada our domestic dough manufacturing and supply chain centers service all of our companyowned stores and over 99 of our domestic franchise stores as a result any prolonged disruption in the operations of any of these facilities whether due to technical or labor difficulties destruction or damage to the facility real estate issues limited capacity or other reasons could adversely affect our business and operating results 

 

our success depends in part upon effective advertising and lower advertising funds may reduce our ability to adequately market the domino’s pizza ® brand 

we have been routinely named a leading national advertiser by advertising age each domino’s store located in the contiguous united states is obligated to pay a percentage of its sales in advertising fees in fiscal 2015 each store in the contiguous united states generally was required to contribute 6 of their sales to dnaf subject in limited instances to lower rates based on certain incentives and waivers which uses such fees for national advertising in addition to contributions for local marketlevel advertising we currently anticipate that this 6 contribution rate will remain in place for the foreseeable future while additional funds for advertising in the past have been provided by us our franchisees and other third parties none of these additional funds are legally required the lack of continued financial support for advertising activities could significantly curtail our marketing efforts which may in turn materially and adversely affect our business and our operating results 

we face risks of litigation and negative publicity from customers franchisees suppliers employees and others in the ordinary course of business which can or could divert our financial and management resources any adverse litigation or publicity may negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations 

claims of illness or injury relating to food quality or food handling are common in the food service industry and vehicular accidents and injuries occur in the food delivery business claims within our industry of improper supplier actions have also recently arisen that if made against one of our suppliers could potentially damage our brand image in addition class action lawsuits have been filed and may continue to be filed against various quick service restaurants alleging among other things that quick service restaurants have failed to disclose the health risks associated with highfat foods and that quick service restaurant marketing practices have encouraged obesity in addition to decreasing our sales and profitability and diverting our management resources adverse publicity or a substantial judgment against us could negatively impact our financial condition results of operations and brand reputation thereby hindering our ability to attract and retain franchisees and grow our business 

further we may be subject to employee franchisee and other claims in the future based on among other things discrimination harassment wrongful termination and wage rest break and meal break issues and those claims relating to overtime compensation we are currently subject to these types of claims and have been subject to these types of claims in the past if one or more of these claims were to be successful or if there is a significant increase in the number of these claims or if we receive significant negative publicity our business financial condition and operating results could be harmed 

loss of key employees or our inability to attract and retain new qualified employees could hurt our business and inhibit our ability to operate and grow successfully 

our success in the highly competitive pizza delivery and carryout business will continue to depend to a significant extent on our leadership team and other key management personnel other than with our president and chief executive officer j patrick doyle we do not have longterm employment agreements with any of our executive officers as a result we may not be able to retain our executive officers and key personnel or attract additional qualified management while we do not have longterm employment agreements with our executive officers for all of our executive officers we have noncompete and nonsolicitation agreements that extend for 24 months following the termination of such executive officer’s employment our success will also continue to depend on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel to operate our stores dough manufacturing and supply chain centers and international operations the loss of these employees or our inability to recruit and retain qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 

adverse global economic conditions subject us to additional risk 

our financial condition and results of operations are impacted by global markets and economic conditions over which neither we nor our franchisees have control an economic downturn including deterioration in the economic conditions in the us or international markets where we compete may result in a reduction in the demand for our products longer payment cycles slower adoption of new technologies and increased price competition poor economic conditions may adversely affect the ability of our franchisees to pay royalties or amounts owed and could have a material adverse impact on our ability to pursue our growth strategy which would reduce cash collections and in turn may materially and adversely affect our ability to service our debt obligations 

our international operations subject us to additional risk such risks and costs may differ in each country in which we and our franchisees do business and may cause our profitability to decline due to increased costs 

we conduct a significant and growing portion of our business outside the united states our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected if global markets in which our franchise stores compete are affected by changes in political economic or other factors these factors over which neither we nor our franchisees have control may include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 fluctuations in the value of the us dollar in relation to other currencies may lead to lower revenues and earnings 

exchange rate fluctuations could have an adverse effect on our results of operations approximately 74 of our total revenues in 2015 77 of our total revenues in 2014 and 74 of our total revenues in 2013 were derived from our international franchise segment a majority of which were denominated in foreign currencies we also operate dough manufacturing and distribution facilities in canada which generate revenues denominated in canadian dollars sales made by franchise stores outside the united states are denominated in the currency of the country in which the store is located and this currency could become less valuable in us dollars as a result of exchange rate fluctuations unfavorable currency fluctuations could lead to increased prices to customers outside the united states or lower profitability to our franchisees outside the united states or could result in lower revenues for us on a us dollar basis from such customers and franchisees a hypothetical 10 adverse change in the foreign currency rates in our international markets would have resulted in a negative impact on international royalty revenues of approximately 156 million in 2015 

we may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property which could harm the value of our brand and branded products and adversely affect our business 

we depend in large part on our brand and branded products and believe that they are very important to our business we rely on a combination of trademarks copyrights service marks trade secrets and similar intellectual property rights to protect our brand and branded products the success of our business depends on our continued ability to use our existing trademarks and service marks in order to increase brand awareness and further develop our branded products in both domestic and international markets we have registered certain trademarks and have other trademark registrations pending in the united states and foreign jurisdictions not all of the trademarks that we currently use have been registered in all of the countries in which we do business and they may never be registered in all of these countries we may not be able to adequately protect our trademarks and our use of these trademarks may result in liability for trademark infringement trademark dilution or unfair competition all of the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property in the united states and in foreign countries may not be adequate in addition the laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states further through acquisitions of third parties we may acquire brands and related trademarks that are subject to the same risks as the brands and trademarks we currently own 

we may from time to time be required to institute litigation to enforce our trademarks or other intellectual property rights or to protect our trade secrets such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could negatively affect our sales profitability and prospects regardless of whether we are able to successfully enforce our rights 

our earnings and business growth strategy depends on the success of our franchisees and we may be harmed by actions taken by our franchisees or employees of our franchisees that are outside of our control 

a significant portion of our earnings comes from royalties and fees generated by our franchise stores franchisees are independent operators and their employees are not our employees we provide tools for franchisees to use in training their employees but the quality of franchise store operations may be diminished by any number of factors beyond our control consequently franchisees may not successfully operate stores in a manner consistent with our standards and requirements if they do not our image and reputation may suffer and as a result our revenues and stock price could decline while we try to ensure that our franchisees maintain the quality of our brand and branded products our franchisees may take actions that adversely affect the value of our intellectual property or reputation as of january 3 2016 we had 841 domestic franchisees operating 4816 domestic stores 13 of these franchisees each operate over 50 domestic stores including our largest domestic franchisee who operates 191 stores and the average franchisee owns and operates six stores 

 

in addition our international master franchisees are generally responsible for the development of significantly more stores than our domestic franchisees as a result our international operations are more closely tied to the success of a smaller number of franchisees than our domestic operations our largest international master franchisee operates 1561 stores in six markets which accounts for approximately 21 of our total international store count our domestic and international franchisees may not operate their franchises successfully if one or more of our key franchisees were to become insolvent or otherwise were unable or unwilling to pay us our royalties or other amounts owed our business and results of operations would be adversely affected 

interruption failure or compromise of our information technology communications systems and electronic data could hurt our ability to effectively serve our customers and protect customer data which could damage our reputation and adversely affect our business and operating results 

a significant portion of our retail sales depends on the continuing operation of our information technology and communications systems including but not limited to domino’s pulse™ our online ordering platforms and our credit card processing systems our information technology communication systems and electronic data may be vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes terrorist attacks floods fires power loss telecommunications failures computer viruses loss of data unauthorized data breaches or other attempts to harm our systems additionally we operate data centers that are also subject to breakins sabotage and intentional acts of vandalism that could cause disruptions in our ability to serve our customers and protect customer data some of our systems are not fully redundant and our disaster recovery planning cannot account for all eventualities the occurrence of a natural disaster intentional sabotage or other unanticipated problems could result in lengthy interruptions in our service any errors or vulnerabilities in our systems or damage to or failure of our systems could result in interruptions in our services and noncompliance with certain regulations which could reduce our revenues and profits and damage our business and brand 

we rely on proprietary and commercially available systems software tools and monitoring to provide security for processing transmission and storage of confidential customer information such as payment card and personal information and any unauthorized data breaches could damage our reputation and adversely affect our business  

unauthorized intrusion into the portions of our computer systems or those of our franchisees that process and store information related to customer transactions may result in the theft of customer data furthermore the systems currently used for transmission and approval of payment card transactions and the technology utilized in payment cards themselves all of which can put payment card data at risk are determined and mandated by payment card industry standards not by us in addition to improper activities by third parties bugs in newlydeployed or early stage advances in hardware and software capabilities encryption technology and other events or developments may facilitate or result in a compromise or breach of our computer systems any such compromises or breaches could cause interruptions in operations and damage to the reputation of the domino’s pizza ® brand subject us to costs and liabilities and hurt sales revenues and profits 

we are subject to extensive government regulation and requirements issued by other groups and our failure to comply with existing or increased regulations could adversely affect our business and operating results 

we are subject to numerous federal state local and foreign laws and regulations as well as requirements issued by other groups including those relating to 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 the patient protection and affordable care act and subsequent amendments require employers such as us to provide health insurance for all qualifying employees or pay penalties for not providing coverage the majority of the increases in these costs began in 2015 and we anticipate that they will escalate in subsequent years while the incremental costs of this program have not been material to us these costs will likely have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position as well as an adverse effect on some of our larger franchisees 

 

we may also become subject to legislation or regulation seeking to tax andor regulate highfat foods foods with high sugar and salt content or foods otherwise deemed to be “unhealthy” if we fail to comply with existing or future laws and regulations we may be subject to governmental or judicial fines or sanctions in addition our capital expenditures could increase due to remediation measures that may be required if we are found to be noncompliant with any of these laws or regulations 

we are also subject to a federal trade commission rule and to various state and foreign laws that govern the offer and sale of franchises additionally these laws regulate various aspects of the franchise relationship including terminations and the refusal to renew franchises the failure to comply with these laws and regulations in any jurisdiction or to obtain required government approvals could result in a ban or temporary suspension on future franchise sales fines or other penalties or require us to make offers of rescission or restitution any of which could adversely affect our business and operating results 

our current insurance coverage may not be adequate insurance premiums for such coverage may increase and we may not be able to obtain insurance at acceptable rates or at all 

we have retention programs for workers’ compensation general liability and owned and nonowned automobile liabilities we are generally responsible for up to 10 million per occurrence under these retention programs for workers’ compensation and general liability we are also generally responsible for between 500000 and 30 million per occurrence under these retention programs for owned and nonowned automobile liabilities total insurance limits under these retention programs vary depending upon the period covered and range up to 1100 million per occurrence for general liability and owned and nonowned automobile liabilities and up to the applicable statutory limits for workers’ compensation these insurance policies may not be adequate to protect us from liabilities that we incur in our business in addition in the future our insurance premiums may increase and we may not be able to obtain similar levels of insurance on reasonable terms or at all any such inadequacy of or inability to obtain insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our annual and quarterly financial results are subject to significant fluctuations depending on various factors many of which are beyond our control and if we fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors our share price may decline significantly 

our sales and operating results can vary significantly from quartertoquarter and yeartoyear depending on various factors many of which are beyond our control these factors include among other things 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 as a result our operational performance may decline quickly and significantly in response to changes in order patterns or rapid decreases in demand for our products we anticipate that fluctuations in operating results will continue in the future 

our common stock price could be subject to significant fluctuations andor may decline 

the market price of our common stock could be subject to significant fluctuations among the factors that could affect our stock price are 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 the stock markets in general have experienced volatility that has sometimes been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies these broad market fluctuations may cause the trading price of our common stock to decline 

 

our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our business and limit our ability to plan for or respond to changes in our business 

we have a substantial amount of indebtedness as of january 3 2016 our consolidated longterm indebtedness was approximately 224 billion we may also incur additional debt which would not be prohibited under the terms of our current securitized debt agreements our substantial indebtedness could have important consequences to our business and our shareholders for example it could 

 

  

  

  

 in addition the financial and other covenants we agreed to with our lenders may limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness make investments pay dividends and engage in other transactions and the leverage may cause potential lenders to be less willing to loan funds to us in the future our failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default that if not cured or waived could result in the acceleration of repayment of all of our indebtedness 

we may be unable to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our significant debt service obligations which would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

our ability to make principal and interest payments on and to refinance our indebtedness will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future this to a certain extent is subject to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control if our business does not generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the amounts projected or at all or if future borrowings are not available to us under our variable funding notes in amounts sufficient to fund our other liquidity needs our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected if we cannot generate sufficient cash flow from operations to make scheduled principal amortization and interest payments on our debt obligations in the future we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity sell assets delay capital expenditures or seek additional equity if we are unable to refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all or to effect any other action relating to our indebtedness on satisfactory terms or at all our business may be harmed 

the terms of our securitized debt financing of certain of our whollyowned subsidiaries have restrictive terms and our failure to comply with any of these terms could put us in default which would have an adverse effect on our business and prospects 

unless and until we repay all outstanding borrowings under our securitized debt we will remain subject to the restrictive terms of these borrowings the securitized debt under which certain of our whollyowned subsidiaries issued and guaranteed fixed rate notes and variable funding senior revolving notes contain a number of covenants with the most significant financial covenant being a debt service coverage calculation these covenants limit the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to among other things 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 the securitized debt also requires us to maintain specified financial ratios at the end of each fiscal quarter these restrictions could affect our ability to pay dividends or repurchase shares of our common stock our ability to meet these financial ratios can be affected by events beyond our control and we may not satisfy such a test a breach of this covenant could result in a rapid amortization event or default under the securitized debt if amounts owed under the securitized debt are accelerated because of a default under the securitized debt and we are unable to pay such amounts the investors may have the right to assume control of substantially all of the securitized assets 

 

during the term following issuance the outstanding senior notes will accrue interest at fixed rates additionally our senior notes have original scheduled principal payments of 590 million in 2016 386 million in each of 2017 and 2018 8785 million in 2019 4880 million in 2020 80 million in each of 2021 through 2024 and 7280 million in 2025 in accordance with our debt agreements the payment of principal on the outstanding senior notes i shall be suspended if the leverage ratios for the company are less than or equal to 45x total debt to ebitda and there are no scheduled principal catchup amounts outstanding provided that during any such suspension principal payments will continue to accrue and are subject to catchup upon failure to satisfy the leverage ratios or ii on and after the payment in full of the 2012 fixed rate senior secured notes may be suspended if the leverage ratios for the company are less than or equal to 50x total debt to ebitda and no catch up provisions are applicable 

if we are unable to refinance or repay amounts under the securitized debt prior to the expiration of the term our cash flow would be directed to the repayment of the securitized debt and other than a weekly management fee sufficient to cover minimal selling general and administrative expenses would not be available for operating our business 

no assurance can be given that any refinancing or additional financing will be possible when needed or that we will be able to negotiate acceptable terms in addition our access to capital is affected by prevailing conditions in the financial and capital markets and other factors beyond our control there can be no assurance that market conditions will be favorable at the times that we require new or additional financing 

the indenture governing the securitized debt will restrict the cash flow from the entities subject to the securitization to any of our other entities and upon the occurrence of certain events cash flow would be further restricted 

in the event that a rapid amortization event occurs under the indenture including without limitation upon an event of default under the indenture or the failure to repay the securitized debt at the end of its term the funds available to us would be reduced or eliminated which would in turn reduce our ability to operate or grow our business

 item 3 legal proceedings 

we are a party to lawsuits revenue agent reviews by taxing authorities and administrative proceedings in the ordinary course of business which include without limitation workers’ compensation general liability automobile and franchisee claims we are also subject to suits related to employment practices 

litigation is subject to many uncertainties and the outcome of individual litigated matters is not predictable with assurance included in the ordinary course litigation matters referenced above we are party to two employment practice cases and two casualty cases we have established legal and insurance accruals for losses relating to these cases which we believe are reasonable based upon our assessment of the current facts and circumstances however it is reasonably possible that our ultimate losses could exceed the amounts recorded by 20 million the remaining cases referenced above could be decided unfavorably to us and could require us to pay damages or make other expenditures in amounts or a range of amounts that cannot be estimated with accuracy in management’s opinion these matters individually and in the aggregate should not have a significant adverse effect on the financial condition of the company and the established accruals adequately provide for the estimated resolution of such claims

on september 11 2012 domino’s pizza llc was named as a defendant in a lawsuit along with mac pizza management inc a large franchisee and joshua balka the franchisee’s delivery driver filed by raghurami reddy the plaintiff the case involved a traffic accident in which the franchisee’s delivery driver collided with another vehicle where the driver of the other vehicle sustained head injuries and the passenger of the other vehicle sustained fatal injuries the jury delivered a 320 million judgment for the plaintiff where the company was found to be 60 liable the company denied liability and filed an appeal of the verdict on a variety of grounds in the first quarter of 2015 the appellate court reversed the trial court’s decision and dismissed the claims against the company the plaintiff has filed a writ of review with the supreme court of the state of texas the company filed opposition to the writ of review and the matter is currently pending before the supreme court of the state of texas the company continues to deny liability in this matter and assert that the claims were appropriately dismissed by the court of appeals of the state of texas 

while we may occasionally be party to large claims including class action suits we do not believe that these matters individually or in the aggregate will materially affect our financial position results of operations or cash flows

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america the preparation of these financial statements requires our management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis our management evaluates its estimates including those related to revenue recognition longlived and intangible assets insurance and legal matters sharebased payments and income taxes we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from those estimates changes in our accounting policies and estimates could materially impact our results of operations and financial condition for any particular period we believe that our most critical accounting policies and estimates are 

revenue recognition  we earn revenues through our network of domestic companyowned and franchised stores dough manufacturing and supply chain centers and international operations retail sales from franchise stores are reported to the company by its franchisees and are not included in company revenues retail sales from companyowned stores and royalty revenues resulting from the retail sales from franchised stores are recognized as revenues when the items are delivered to or carried out by customers retail sales are generally reported and related royalties paid to the company based on a percentage of retail sales as specified in the related standard franchise agreement generally 55 of domestic franchise retail sales and on average 31 of international franchise retail sales revenues from companyowned stores and royalty revenues from franchised stores can fluctuate from timetotime as a result of store count and sales level changes this can occur when a companyowned store is sold to a franchisee if a companyowned store that generated 500000 in revenue in fiscal 2014 was sold to a franchisee in fiscal 2015 revenues from companyowned stores would have declined by 500000 in fiscal 2015 while franchise royalty revenues would have increased by only 27500 in fiscal 2015 as we generally collect 55 of a domestic franchisee’s retail sales sales of food from our supply chain centers are recognized as revenues upon delivery of the food to franchisees while sales of equipment and supplies are generally recognized as revenues upon shipment of the related products to franchisees 

longlived and intangible assets we record longlived assets including property plant and equipment and capitalized software at cost for acquisitions of franchise operations we estimate the fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired based on physical inspection of assets historical experience and other information available to us regarding the acquisition we depreciate and amortize longlived assets using useful lives determined by us based on historical experience and other information available to us we evaluate the potential impairment of longlived assets at least annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable our evaluation is based on various analyses including the projection of undiscounted cash flows for companyowned stores we perform related impairment tests on an operating market basis which the company has determined to be the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of other cash flows if the carrying amount of a longlived asset exceeds the amount of the expected future undiscounted cash flows of that asset the company estimates the fair value of the asset if the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset an impairment loss is recognized and the asset is written down to its estimated fair value 

 

we have not made any significant changes in the methodology used to project the future market cash flows of companyowned stores during the years presented same store sales fluctuations and the rates at which operating costs will fluctuate in the future are key factors in evaluating recoverability of the related assets if our same store sales significantly decline or if operating costs increase and we are unable to recover these costs the carrying value of our companyowned stores by market may be unrecoverable and we may be required to recognize an impairment charge as discussed in note 1 to our consolidated financial statements the company incurred an impairment charge related to its corporate airplane in the fourth quarter of 2014 aside from this impairment charge the company did not record an impairment charge during fiscal 2014 or fiscal 2015 

a significant portion of our goodwill relates to acquisitions of domestic franchise stores and is included in our domestic stores segment specifically our companyowned stores division we evaluate goodwill annually for impairment by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit which is primarily determined using the present value of historical cash flows to its carrying value if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value goodwill would be impaired we have not made any significant changes in the methodology used to evaluate goodwill impairment during the years presented at january 3 2016 the fair value of our business operations with associated goodwill exceeded their recorded carrying value including the related goodwill if cash flows generated by our companyowned stores were to decline significantly in the future or there were negative revisions to the market multiple assumption we may be required to recognize a goodwill impairment charge however based on the latest impairment analysis we do not believe it is reasonably likely that there could be changes in assumptions that would trigger impairment 

insurance and legal matters we are a party to lawsuits and legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business management closely monitors these legal matters and estimates the probable costs for the resolution of such matters these estimates are primarily determined by consulting with both internal and external parties handling the matters and are based upon an analysis of potential results assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies legal judgments can be volatile and difficult to predict accordingly if our estimates relating to legal matters proved inaccurate for any reason we may be required to increase or decrease the related expense in future periods we had accruals for legal matters of approximately 19 million at january 3 2016 and 43 million at december 28 2014 

for certain periods prior to december 1998 and for periods after december 2001 we maintain insurance coverage for workers’ compensation general liability and owned and nonowned auto liability under insurance policies requiring payment of a deductible for each occurrence up to between 500000 and 30 million depending on the policy year and line of coverage the related insurance reserves are based on undiscounted independent actuarial estimates which are based on historical information along with assumptions about future events specifically various methods including analyses of historical trends and actuarial valuation methods are utilized to estimate the cost to settle reported claims and claims incurred but not yet reported the actuarial valuation methods develop estimates of the future ultimate claim costs based on the claims incurred as of the balance sheet date when estimating these liabilities several factors are considered including the severity duration and frequency of claims legal cost associated with claims healthcare trends and projected inflation 

our methodology for determining our exposure has remained consistent throughout the years presented management believes that the various assumptions developed and actuarial methods used to determine our selfinsurance reserves are reasonable and provide meaningful data that management uses to make its best estimate of our exposure to these risks changes in assumptions for such factors as medical costs and legal actions as well as changes in actual experience could cause our estimates to change in the near term which could result in an increase or decrease in the related expense in future periods a 10 change in our selfinsurance liability at january 3 2016 would have affected our income before provision for income taxes by approximately 41 million for fiscal 2015 we had accruals for insurance matters of approximately 409 million at january 3 2016 and 414 million at december 28 2014 

sharebased payments we recognize compensation expense related to our sharebased compensation arrangements over the requisite service period based on the grant date fair value of the awards the grant date fair value of each restricted stock and performancebased restricted stock award is equal to the market price of our stock on the date of grant the grant date fair value of each stock option award is estimated using a blackscholes option pricing model the pricing model requires assumptions including the expected life of the stock option the riskfree interest rate the expected dividend yield and expected volatility of our stock over the expected life which significantly impact the assumed fair value we are also required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and only recognize expense for those awards expected to vest we use historical data to determine these assumptions additionally our stock option restricted stock and performancebased restricted stock arrangements provide for accelerated vesting and the ability to exercise during the remainder of the tenyear stock option life upon the retirement of individuals holding the awards who have achieved specified service and age requirements 

 

management believes that the methods and various assumptions used to determine compensation expense related to these arrangements are reasonable but if the assumptions change significantly for future grants sharebased compensation expense will fluctuate in future years 

income taxes we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities we measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using current enacted tax rates that will apply in the years in which we expect the temporary differences to be recovered or paid judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes related reserves and deferred tax assets and liabilities these include establishing a valuation allowance related to the ability to realize certain deferred tax assets if necessary on an ongoing basis management will assess whether it remains more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets will be realized the company had valuation allowances recorded for deferred tax assets of approximately 02 million as of january 3 2016 and approximately 05 million as of december 28 2014 our accounting for deferred tax assets represents our best estimate of future events our net deferred tax assets assume that we will generate sufficient taxable income in specific tax jurisdictions based on our estimates and assumptions changes in our current estimates due to unanticipated events could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

the amounts recorded on the balance sheet relating to uncertain tax positions consider the ultimate resolution of revenue agent reviews based on estimates and assumptions we believe we have appropriately accounted for our uncertain tax positions however tax audits changes in tax laws and other unforeseen matters may result in us owing additional taxes we adjust our reserves for uncertain tax positions when facts and circumstances change or due to the passage of time the completion of a tax audit or the expiration of a statute of limitations associated with uncertain tax positions are examples of situations when we may adjust our reserves management believes that our tax positions comply with applicable tax law and that we have adequately provided for these matters however to the extent the final tax outcome of these matters is different than our recorded amounts we may be required to adjust our tax reserves resulting in additional income tax expense or benefit in future periods

 2015 compared to 2014 

tabular amounts in millions except percentages 

revenues revenues primarily consist of retail sales from our companyowned stores royalties and fees from our domestic and international franchised stores and sales of food equipment and supplies from our supply chain centers to substantially all of our domestic franchised stores and certain international franchised stores companyowned store and franchised store revenues may vary from period to period due to changes in store count mix supply chain revenues may vary significantly as a result of fluctuations in commodity prices as well as the mix of products we sell 

consolidated revenues increased 2227 million or 112 in 2015 the increase was due primarily to higher supply chain food volumes as well as increased sales of equipment to stores in connection with our store reimaging program higher companyowned store domestic franchise and international franchise revenues resulting from same store sales and store count growth also contributed to the rise in revenue the inclusion of the 53 rd week in 2015 also positively impacted revenues by an estimated 497 million these increases were offset in part by the negative impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on international franchise royalties and international supply chain revenues as well as lower cheese and other commodity prices these changes in revenues are more fully described below 

domestic stores revenues from domestic stores are primarily comprised of retail sales from domestic companyowned store operations as well as royalties from retail sales and other fees from domestic franchised stores as summarized in the following table 

 

 higher franchise same store sales store count growth and higher domestic companyowned same store sales drove an increase in overall domestic store revenues of 910 million or 157 these results are more fully described below 

domestic companyowned stores revenues from domestic companyowned store operations increased 484 million or 139 in 2015 this increase was due to a 122 increase in same store sales as compared to 2014 as well as an estimated 91 million impact of the 53 rd week offset in part by the sale of 14 companyowned stores to a franchisee that occurred in the first quarter of 2014 

domestic franchise revenues from domestic franchise operations increased 426 million or 185 in 2015 the increase was driven by an 119 increase in same store sales as compared to 2014 as well as an estimated 61 million impact of the 53 rd week and an increase in the average number of domestic franchised stores open during 2015 revenues further benefited from fees paid by franchisees to reimburse us for expenses we incurred for our internally developed online ordering platform 

 

supply chain revenues from supply chain operations are primarily comprised of sales of food equipment and supplies from our supply chain centers to substantially all of our domestic franchised stores and certain international franchised stores as summarized in the following table 

 

 domestic supply chain domestic supply chain revenues increased 1154 million or 101 in 2015 these increases were primarily attributable to higher volumes from increased order counts at the store level and increases in sales of equipment in connection with our store reimaging program as well as an estimated 278 million impact of the 53 rd week they were partially offset by lower cheese and other commodity prices we estimate that the lower cheese block price passed through directly in domestic supply chain pricing to franchisees resulted in an approximate 453 million decrease in domestic supply chain revenues during 2015 

international supply chain revenues from international supply chain operations increased 52 million or 43 in 2015 this increase resulted primarily from higher volumes in 2015 and an estimated 26 million impact of the 53 rd week and were offset in part by the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates of approximately 164 million in 2015 

international franchise international franchise revenues primarily consist of royalties from retail sales and other fees from our international franchise stores revenues from international franchise operations increased 110 million or 72 in 2015 this increase was due to an increase in the average number of international stores open during 2015 higher same store sales and an estimated 41 million impact of the 53 rd week and was offset in part by the negative impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates of approximately 199 million in 2015 excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rates same store sales increased 78 in 2015 compared to 2014 when the impact of foreign currency exchange rates is included same store sales decreased 44 in 2015 compared to 2014 this variance was caused by a generally stronger us dollar when compared to the currencies in the international markets in which we compete 

cost of sales  operating margin consolidated cost of sales consists primarily of domestic companyowned store and supply chain costs incurred to generate related revenues components of consolidated cost of sales primarily include food labor and occupancy costs the changes to the consolidated operating margin which we define as revenues less cost of sales are summarized in the following table 

 

 the 883 million or 149 increase in consolidated operating margin was due primarily to higher domestic and international franchise revenues and higher supply chain margins as well as an estimated 166 million impact of the 53 rd week franchise revenues do not have a cost of sales component so changes in franchise revenues have a disproportionate effect on the consolidated operating margin 

as a percentage of total revenues our consolidated operating margin increased 10 percentage points in 2015 due to higher supply chain and companyowned stores operating margins as a percentage of their revenues as well as a higher mix of franchise revenues these changes are more fully described below 

domestic companyowned stores the changes to domestic companyowned store operating margin which do not include other storelevel costs such as royalties and advertising are summarized in the following table 

 

 the 165 million or 204 increase in the domestic companyowned store operating margin was due primarily to higher same store sales a decrease in overall commodity prices and an estimated 31 million impact of the 53 rd week 

 

as a percentage of store revenues the store operating margin increased 13 percentage points in 2015 as discussed in more detail below 

 

  

  

  

 supply chain the changes to the supply chain operating margin are summarized in the following table 

 

 the 183 million increase in the supply chain operating margin was due primarily to higher volumes from increased store order counts and an estimated 33 million impact of the 53 rd week 

as a percentage of supply chain revenues the supply chain operating margin increased 04 percentage points in 2015 due to lower commodity prices and lower fuel costs however the operating margin was negatively impacted by incremental casualty and health insurance expense including 14 million recorded in the third quarter of 2015 related to updated actuarial estimates for our casualty insurance program as well as increased labor and delivery costs decreases in certain food prices have a positive effect on the supply chain operating margin percentage due to the fixed dollar margin earned by supply chain on certain food items changes in our us cheese prices decreased both revenues and costs by 453 million in fiscal 2015 if our us cheese prices for 2015 had been in effect during 2014 the supply chain operating margin as a percentage of supply chain revenues would have increased by 04 percentage points however the dollar margin would have been unaffected 

general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses increased 283 million or 113 in 2015 these increases were driven by continued investments in technological initiatives and labor primarily in ecommerce information technology and international operations as well as higher volumedriven expenses resulting from improved operating performance and higher same store sales including variable performancebased compensation companyowned store national advertising contributions and franchisee incentives the nonrecurring 17 million pretax gain recognized from the sale of 14 companyowned stores during the first quarter of 2014 and an estimated 47 million impact of the inclusion of the 53 rd week in 2015 also contributed to the increase for fiscal 2015 these increases were offset in part by the nonrecurring 58 million impairment charge in 2014 

interest income interest income increased slightly to 03 million in 2015 

interest expense interest expense increased 126 million to 995 million in 2015 the increase was due primarily to approximately 73 million of expenses incurred in the fourth quarter of 2015 related to the 2015 recapitalization including a 69 million writeoff of debt issuance costs and 04 million of interest expense that was incurred on the 2012 debt subsequent to the closing of the 2015 recapitalization but prior to the repayment of the 2012 debt interest expense also increased due to a higher average debt balance offset in part by a lower average interest rate 

our cash borrowing rate decreased to 51 in fiscal 2015 from 53 in fiscal 2014 the decrease in the company’s cash borrowing rate resulted from the lower interest rate on the new debt issued as part of the 2015 recapitalization our average outstanding debt balance excluding capital lease obligations was approximately 168 billion in 2015 and approximately 152 billion in 2014 the increase in the average outstanding debt balance was due to the issuance of debt in connection with the 2015 recapitalization 

provision for income taxes provision for income taxes increased 174 million to 1134 million in 2015 due primarily to higher pretax income the company’s effective income tax rate decreased slightly by 01 percentage points to 370 of pretax income in 2015 

2014 compared to 2013 

tabular amounts in millions except percentages 

revenues consolidated revenues increased 1916 million or 106 in 2014 the increase was driven by higher supply chain revenues due to higher volumes from increased store order counts higher commodity prices and increased sales of equipment to stores in connection with our store reimaging program domestic store revenues rose due to an increase in same store sales and store count growth in addition higher international franchise same store sales and store count growth also increased consolidated revenues these increases were offset in part by the negative impact on international revenues of changes in foreign currency exchange rates 

 

these changes in revenues are more fully described below 

domestic stores domestic stores revenues are summarized in the following table 

 

 higher franchise same store sales store count growth and higher domestic companyowned same store sales drove an increase in overall domestic store revenues of 289 million or 53 these results are more fully described below 

domestic companyowned stores revenues from domestic companyowned store operations increased 111 million or 33 in 2014 this increase was due to a 62 increase in same store sales as compared to 2013 offset in part by a decrease in the average number of domestic companyowned stores open during 2014 

domestic franchise revenues from domestic franchise operations increased 178 million or 84 in 2014 the increase was driven by a 77 increase in same store sales as compared to 2013 and to a lesser extent an increase in the average number of domestic franchised stores open during 2014 revenues further benefited from fees paid by franchisees related to our insourced online ordering platform and we also incurred an increase in expenses related to these technology initiatives 

supply chain supply chain revenues are summarized in the following table 

 

 domestic supply chain domestic supply chain revenues increased 1312 million or 130 in 2014 the increase was primarily attributable to higher volumes from increased order counts at the store level higher overall commodity prices and increases in sales of equipment and supplies changes in us cheese prices increased revenues by approximately 330 million in 2014 

international supply chain revenues from international supply chain operations increased 124 million or 113 in 2014 this increase resulted primarily from higher volumes in 2014 and was offset in part by the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates of approximately 73 million during the year 

international franchise international franchise revenues primarily consist of royalties from retail sales and other fees from our international franchise stores revenues from international franchise operations increased 190 million or 143 in 2014 this increase was due to higher same store sales and an increase in the average number of international stores open during 2014 and was offset in part by the negative impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates of approximately 34 million in 2014 excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rates same store sales increased 69 in 2014 compared to 2013 when the impact of foreign currency exchange rates is included same store sales increased 49 in 2014 compared to 2013 this variance was caused by a generally stronger us dollar when compared to the currencies in the international markets in which we compete 

cost of sales  operating margin the changes to the consolidated operating margin which we define as revenues less cost of sales are summarized in the following table 

 

 the 458 million or 83 increase in consolidated operating margin was due primarily to higher domestic and international franchise revenues and higher supply chain margins franchise revenues do not have a cost of sales component so changes in franchise revenues have a disproportionate effect on the consolidated operating margin 

as a percentage of total revenues our consolidated operating margin decreased 07 percentage points in 2014 due to lower supply chain and companyowned stores operating margins as a percentage of their revenues these changes were primarily a result of higher commodity prices and were offset in part by a higher mix of franchise revenues and are more fully described below 

 

domestic companyowned stores the changes to domestic companyowned store operating margin which do not include other storelevel costs such as royalties and advertising are summarized in the following table 

 

 the 03 million or 04 increase in the domestic companyowned store operating margin was due primarily to higher same store sales this was offset in part by an increase in overall commodity prices and labor and related expenses 

as a percentage of store revenues the store operating margin decreased 07 percentage points in 2014 as discussed in more detail below 

 

  

  

  

 supply chain the changes to the supply chain operating margin are summarized in the following table 

 

 the 86 million increase in the supply chain operating margin was due primarily to higher volumes from increased store order counts 

as a percentage of supply chain revenues the supply chain operating margin decreased 05 percentage points in 2014 due to higher commodity prices and higher health insurance costs offset in part by the positive impact of higher volumes increases in certain food prices have a negative effect on the supply chain operating margin percentage due to the fixed dollar margin earned by supply chain on certain food items changes in us cheese prices increased both revenues and costs by 330 million in 2014 if the 2014 us cheese prices had been in effect during 2013 the supply chain operating margin as a percentage of supply chain revenues would have decreased by 03 percentage points however the dollar margin would have been unaffected 

general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses increased 142 million or 61 in 2014 these increases were due in part to an impairment charge of 58 million in connection with replacing our corporate airplane as well as continued investments that we made in technology and international initiatives including the addition of team members in both areas a decrease in noncash compensation expense of 44 million partially offset these increases 

interest income interest income decreased slightly to 01 million in 2014 

interest expense interest expense decreased 20 million to 869 million in 2014 the decrease was due primarily to lower interest expense resulting from a lower average debt balance during 2014 compared to 2013 and to a lesser extent lower interest expense from the cash collateralization of our letters of credit 

our cash borrowing rate remained flat at 53 during fiscal 2014 our average outstanding debt balance excluding capital lease obligations was approximately 152 billion in 2014 and approximately 154 billion in 2013 the decrease in the company’s average outstanding debt balance resulted from the principal payments made on its fixed rate notes during the first two quarters of 2014 

provision for income taxes provision for income taxes increased 139 million to 960 million in 2014 due primarily to higher pretax income the company’s effective income tax rate increased 06 percentage points to 371 of pretax income in 2014 the lower effective tax rate in fiscal 2013 primarily resulted from a tax benefit recorded for prior tax years in connection with the company revising its calculation for a deduction related to its domestic dough production 

 

liquidity and capital resources 

historically we have operated with minimal positive working capital or negative working capital primarily because our receivable collection periods and inventory turn rates are faster than the normal payment terms on our current liabilities we generally collect our receivables within three weeks from the date of the related sale and we generally experience 30 to 40 inventory turns per year in addition our sales are not typically seasonal which further limits our working capital requirements these factors coupled with the use of our ongoing cash flows from operations to service our debt obligations invest in our business pay dividends and repurchase our common stock reduce our working capital amounts as of january 3 2016 we had working capital of 457 million excluding restricted cash and cash equivalents of 1809 million and including total unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of 1334 million 

as of january 3 2016 we had approximately 1142 million of restricted cash held for future principal and interest payments 400 million of cash held as collateral for outstanding letters of credit and 267 million of restricted cash held in a threemonth interest reserve as required by the related debt agreements for a total of 1809 million of restricted cash and cash equivalents 

the company entered into a recapitalization transaction in 2015 the “2015 recapitalization” in which certain of our subsidiaries among other things replaced 551 million of the outstanding series 20121 5216 fixed rate senior secured notes class a2 the “2012 fixed rate notes” and its 2012 variable funding notes with new notes the “2015 fixed rate notes” issued pursuant to an assetbacked securitization the 2015 fixed rate notes consist of 500 million of series 20151 3484 fixed rate senior secured notes class a2i the “2015 fiveyear notes” 800 million series 20151 4474 fixed rate senior secured notes class a2ii the “2015 tenyear notes” and 1250 million of series 20151 variable funding senior secured notes class a1 the “2015 variable funding notes” the 2012 fixed rate notes and the 2015 fixed rate notes are referred to collectively as the fixed rate notes additional information related to the 2015 recapitalization transaction is included in note 4 to our consolidated financial statements 

the fixed rate notes have original scheduled principal payments of 590 million in 2016 386 million in each of 2017 and 2018 8785 million in 2019 4880 million in 2020 80 million in each of 2021 through 2024 and 7280 million in 2025 however in accordance with our debt agreements the payment of principal on the outstanding senior notes i shall be suspended if the leverage ratios are less than or equal to 45x total debt to ebitda and there are no scheduled principal catchup amounts outstanding provided that during any such suspension principal payments will continue to accrue and are subject to catchup upon failure to satisfy the leverage ratios or ii on and after the payment in full of the 2012 fixed rate notes may be suspended if the leverage ratios are less than or equal to 50x total debt to ebitda and no catchup provisions are applicable during the second quarter of 2014 we met the maximum leverage ratios of less than 45x and in accordance with our debt agreements ceased debt amortization payments in the third quarter of 2014 the company continued to meet the maximum leverage ratios of less than 45x in each of the quarters prior to the 2015 recapitalization and accordingly did not make previously scheduled debt amortization payments as permitted in the debt agreements subsequent to the 2015 recapitalization the company’s leverage ratios exceeded 45x and accordingly the company began making the scheduled amortization payments as well as the required catchup payments 

the fixed rate notes are subject to certain financial and nonfinancial covenants including a debt service coverage calculation as defined in the related agreements in the event that certain covenants are not met the fixed rate notes may become due and payable on an accelerated schedule 

a portion of proceeds from the 2015 recapitalization were used to make an optional prepayment of approximately 551 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2012 fixed rate notes at par pay scheduled principal catchup amounts on the 2012 fixed rate notes make an interest reserve deposit prefund a portion of the principal and interest payable on the 2015 fixed rate notes and pay transaction fees and expenses in connection with the issuance of the 2015 variable funding notes the company permanently reduced to zero the commitment to fund the 2012 variable funding note facility and the 2012 variable funding note facility was cancelled 

in connection with the 2012 recapitalization the company recorded 399 million of debt issuance costs in connection with the 2015 recapitalization the company wroteoff approximately 69 million of these costs in connection with the extinguishment of 551 million of the 2012 fixed rate notes the remaining debt issuance costs related to the 2012 recapitalization are being amortized into interest expense over the sevenyear expected term of the 2012 fixed rate notes additionally in connection with the 2015 recapitalization the company recorded 174 million of debt issuance costs which are being amortized into interest expense over the five and tenyear expected terms of the 2015 fixed rate notes 

 

during fiscal 2015 and in connection with the 2015 recapitalization the company incurred approximately 81 million of net expenses this consisted primarily of a 69 million net writeoff of debt issuance costs the company also incurred approximately 04 million of interest expense on the 2012 fixed rate notes subsequent to the closing of the 2015 recapitalization but prior to the repayment of the 2012 fixed rate notes resulting in the payment of interest on both the 2012 and 2015 fixed rate notes for a short period of time further the company incurred 09 million of other net 2015 recapitalizationrelated general and administrative expenses including legal and professional fees 

our primary source of liquidity is cash flows from operations and availability of borrowings under our 2015 variable funding notes as of january 3 2016 we had 462 million of outstanding letters of credit and 788 million of available borrowing capacity under our 2015 variable funding notes the letters of credit are primarily related to our casualty insurance programs and supply chain center leases the company has collateralized a portion of these letters of credit with 400 million of restricted cash to reduce its fees on the 2015 variable funding notes and has the ability to access this cash with minimal notice borrowings under the 2015 variable funding notes are available to fund our working capital requirements capital expenditures and subject to other limitations other general corporate purposes including dividend payments 

as part of the 2015 recapitalization on october 23 2015 the company’s board of directors authorized a new share repurchase program to repurchase up to 800 million of the company’s common stock this repurchase program replaced the remaining availability under the company’s previously disclosed 200 million share repurchase program on october 27 2015 the company entered into a 600 million asr agreement with a counterparty 

pursuant to the terms of the asr agreement on october 30 2015 as part of its new 800 million share repurchase authorization the company used a portion of the proceeds from the 2015 recapitalization to pay the counterparty 600 million in cash and received approximately 486 million shares of the company’s common stock at final settlement the counterparty may be required to deliver additional shares of common stock to the company or under certain circumstances the company may be required to deliver shares of its common stock or may elect to make a cash payment to the counterparty based generally on the average of the daily volumeweighted average prices of the company’s common stock during the term of the asr agreement the asr agreement contains provisions customary for agreements of this type including provisions for adjustments to the transaction terms the circumstances generally under which the asr agreement may be accelerated extended or terminated early by the counterparty and various acknowledgments representations and warranties made by the parties to one another final settlement of the asr agreement is expected to be completed by the end of the first quarter of 2016 although the settlement may be accelerated at the counterparty’s option 

the company’s open market share repurchase program has historically been funded by excess cash flows the company used cash of approximately 7386 million in 2015 and 824 million in 2014 for share repurchases the company had approximately 2000 million left under the 8000 million authorization as of january 3 2016 we expect to continue to use ongoing excess cash flow generation and subject to certain restrictions in the documents governing the 2015 variable funding notes availability under the 2015 variable funding notes to among other things repurchase shares under the current authorized program 

in the past three years we have invested between 404 million and 718 million annually in capital expenditures in 2015 we invested 624 million in capital expenditures which primarily related to reimaging our existing companyowned stores and investments in our supply chain centers and training facilities our proprietary internally developed pointofsale system domino’s pulse our digital ordering platform our internal enterprise systems and other technology initiatives we did not have any material commitments for capital expenditures as of january 3 2016 

the following table illustrates the main components of our cash flows 

 

  

operating activities 

cash provided by operating activities was 2918 million in fiscal 2015 our cash provided by operating activities was mainly the result of net income of 1928 million that was generated during 2015 which included noncash amounts of 456 million the changes in operating assets and liabilities also generated 534 million of cash inflows during 2015 

during fiscal 2014 cash provided by operating activities was 1923 million mainly the result of net income of 1626 million generated during fiscal 2014 which included noncash amounts of 297 million 

cash provided by operating activities was 1940 million in fiscal 2013 our cash provided by operating activities was mainly the result of net income of 1430 million that was generated during 2013 which included 395 million of noncash amounts the changes in operating assets and liabilities also generated 115 million of cash inflows during 2013 

we are focused on continually improving our net income and cash flow from operations and management expects to continue to generate positive cash flows from operating activities for the foreseeable future 

investing activities 

during fiscal 2015 cash used in investing activities was 1093 million which consisted primarily of 633 million of capital expenditures driven by investments related to the reimaging our existing companyowned stores and investments in our supply chain centers and training facilities our proprietary internally developed pointofsale system our digital ordering platform our internal enterprise systems and other technology initiatives change in restricted cash of 600 million and offset by proceeds from the sale of assets of 127 million 

during fiscal 2014 cash used in investing activities was 574 million which consisted primarily of 701 million of capital expenditures driven by increased investments in companyowned stores and supply chain centers investments in our technology initiatives and the purchase of a corporate airplane proceeds from the sale of assets of 92 million and a 45 million net change in restricted cash offset the use of cash in investing activities 

cash used in investing activities was 997 million in fiscal 2013 the main drivers of this change were the net change in restricted cash and cash equivalents of 654 million and 404 million of capital expenditures offset by 45 million of proceeds from the sale of assets 

financing activities 

during fiscal 2015 cash used in financing activities was 809 million in fiscal 2015 we issued 13 billion of debt in connection with our 2015 recapitalization which was offset by the purchases of common stock of 7386 million repayments of longterm debt of 564 million of which 551 million was an optional prepayment on our 2012 fixed rate notes using a portion of the proceeds received from the 2015 recapitalization funding dividend payments to our shareholders of 803 million and cash paid for financing costs related to our 2015 recapitalization of 174 million the net tax impact of equitybased compensation of 103 million increased cash from financing activities in fiscal 2015 

we used 1189 million of cash in financing activities in fiscal 2014 compared to 1348 million during fiscal 2013 both primarily related to purchases of common stock funding dividend payments to our shareholders and making payments on our longterm debt obligations the tax impact of equitybased compensation offset the use of cash in financing activities in both fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2013 

during fiscal 2015 we experienced increases in both domestic and international same store sales and both our domestic and international businesses grew the number of stores these factors have contributed to our continued ability to generate positive operating cash flows we expect to use our unrestricted cash and cash equivalents our restricted cash amounts pledged as collateral for letters of credit ongoing cash flows from operations and available borrowings under the 2015 variable funding notes to among other things fund working capital requirements invest in our core business pay dividends and repurchase our common stock based upon the current level of operations and anticipated growth we believe that the cash generated from operations our current unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and amounts available under the 2015 variable funding notes will be more than adequate to meet our anticipated debt service requirements capital expenditures dividend payments and working capital needs for the foreseeable future 

 

our ability to continue to fund these items and continue to reduce debt could be adversely affected by the occurrence of any of the events described in item 1a risk factors there can be no assurance however that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operations or that future borrowings will be available under the 2015 variable funding notes or otherwise to enable us to service our indebtedness or to make anticipated capital expenditures our future operating performance and our ability to service extend or refinance the fixed rate notes and to service extend or refinance the 2015 variable funding notes will be subject to future economic conditions and to financial business and other factors many of which are beyond our control 

impact of inflation 

we believe that our results of operations are not materially impacted by moderate changes in the inflation rate inflation did not have a material impact on our operations in 2015 2014 or 2013 severe increases in inflation however could affect the global and us economies and could have an adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations further discussion on the impact of commodities and other cost pressures is included above as well as in item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

new accounting pronouncements 

in may 2014 the fasb issued accounting standards update 201409 revenue from contracts with customers  or asu 201409 this guidance outlines a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance issued by the fasb including industry specific guidance asu 201409 was originally effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after december 15 2016 and interim periods therein in august 2015 the fasb issued asu 201514 which defers the effective date of asu 201409 one year making it effective for annual reporting periods beginning or after december 15 2017 while also providing for early adoption but not before the original effective date the company is currently assessing the impact on its consolidated financial statements 

in february 2015 the fasb issued accounting standards update 201502 consolidation topic 810 amendments to the consolidation analysis  or asu 201502 asu 201502 amends current consolidation guidance by modifying the evaluation of whether limited partnerships and similar legal entities are variable interest entities or voting interest entities eliminating the presumption that a general partner should consolidate a limited partnership and affects the consolidation analysis of reporting entities that are involved with variable interest entities asu no 201502 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december 15 2015 with early adoption permitted all legal entities are subject to reevaluation under the revised consolidation model the adoption of asu 201502 is not expected to have a material impact on the company’s consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

in april 2015 the fasb issued accounting standards update 201503 simplifying the presentation of debt issuance costs  or asu 201503 asu 201503 requires that debt issuance costs be presented as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the related debt liability consistent with the presentation of debt discounts prior to the issuance of asu 201503 debt issuance costs were required to be presented as deferred charge assets separate from the related debt liability asu 201503 does not change the recognition and measurement requirements for debt issuance costs the company earlyadopted asu 201503 as of the end of its fiscal 2015 and applied its provisions retrospectively the adoption of asu 201503 resulted in the reclassification of 279 million and 229 million of unamortized debt issuance costs related to the company’s fixed rate notes from other noncurrent assets to longterm debt within its consolidated balance sheets as of both january 3 2016 and december 28 2014 respectively refer to note 4 of the financial statements for additional detail other than this reclassification the adoption of asu 201503 did not have an impact on the company’s consolidated financial statements

accounting standards that have been issued by the fasb or other standardssetting bodies that do not require adoption until a future date are not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements upon adoption 

 

contractual obligations 

the following is a summary of our significant contractual obligations at january 3 2016 

 

  

    liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits of 21 million are excluded from the above table as we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period of payment for additional information on unrecognized tax benefits see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we are party to letters of credit and to a lesser extent financial guarantees with offbalance sheet risk our exposure to credit loss for letters of credit and financial guarantees is represented by the contractual amounts of these instruments total conditional commitments under letters of credit as of january 3 2016 were approximately 462 million and relate to our insurance programs and supply chain center leases the company has guaranteed lease payments related to certain franchisees’ lease arrangements the maximum amount of potential future payments under these guarantees is 18 million as of january 3 2016 we believe that none of these arrangements has or is likely to have a material effect on our results of operations financial condition revenues or expenses capital expenditures or liquidity

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk 

we do not engage in speculative transactions nor do we hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes in connection with the 2015 recapitalization we issued fixed rate notes and at january 3 2016 we are only exposed to interest rate risk on borrowings under our 2015 variable funding notes as of january 3 2016 we had no outstanding borrowings under our 2015 variable funding notes our fixed rate debt exposes the company to changes in market interest rates reflected in the fair value of the debt and to the risk that the company may need to refinance maturing debt with new debt at a higher rate 

we are exposed to market risks from changes in commodity prices during the normal course of business we purchase cheese and certain other food products that are affected by changes in commodity prices and as a result we are subject to volatility in our food costs we may periodically enter into financial instruments to manage this risk we do not engage in speculative transactions nor do we hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes in instances when we use fixed pricing agreements with our suppliers these agreements cover our physical commodity needs are not netsettled and are accounted for as normal purchases 

historically we have entered into interest rate swaps from time to time collars or similar instruments with the objective of managing volatility relating to our borrowing costs we had no outstanding derivative instruments as of january 3 2016 or december 28 2014 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

we have exposure to various foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations for revenues generated by our operations outside the united states which can adversely impact our net income and cash flows approximately 74 of our total revenues in 2015 77 of our total revenues in 2014 and 74 of our total revenues in 2013 were derived from our international franchise segment a majority of which were denominated in foreign currencies we also operate dough manufacturing and distribution facilities in canada which generate revenues denominated in canadian dollars we do not enter into financial instruments to manage this foreign currency exchange risk a hypothetical 10 adverse change in the foreign currency rates for our international markets would have resulted in a negative impact on royalty revenues of approximately 156 million in 2015

 item 1 business 

overview 

domino’s is the second largest pizza restaurant chain in the world with more than 11600 locations in over 75 markets founded in 1960 our roots are in convenient pizza delivery while a significant amount of our sales also come from carryout customers although we are a highlyrecognized global brand we focus on serving the local neighborhoods in which we live and do business through our large network of franchise owners and companyowned stores on average we sell more than 15 million pizzas each day throughout our global system 

our business model is straightforward we handcraft and serve quality food at a competitive price with easy ordering access and efficient service which are enhanced by our technology innovations our dough is generally made fresh and distributed to stores around the world by us and our franchisees 

domino’s generates revenues and earnings by charging royalties to its franchisees royalties are ongoing percentofsales fees for use of the domino’s brand marks the company also generates revenues and earnings by selling food equipment and supplies to franchisees primarily in the us and canada and by operating a number of our own stores franchisees profit by selling pizza and other complementary items to their local customers in our international markets we generally grant geographical rights to the domino’s pizza ® brand to master franchisees these master franchisees are charged with developing their geographical area and they profit by subfranchising and selling ingredients and equipment to those subfranchisees as well as by running pizza stores everyone in the system can benefit including the end consumer who can feed their family domino’s menu items conveniently and economically 

our business model can yield strong returns for our franchise owners and companyowned stores it can also yield significant cash flow to us through a consistent franchise royalty payment and supply chain revenue stream with moderate capital expenditures we have historically returned cash to shareholders through dividend payments and share buybacks since becoming a publiclytraded company 

our history 

we pioneered the pizza delivery business and built domino’s pizza ® into one of the most widelyrecognized consumer brands in the world we have been delivering quality affordable food to our customers since 1960 when brothers thomas and james monaghan borrowed 900 to purchase a small pizza store in ypsilanti michigan thomas purchased his brother’s share of the business shortly thereafter concentrating first on building stores near college campuses and military bases in the 1960s and 1970s the brand grew quickly in the 1980s in urban markets and near residential communities we became “domino’s pizza” in 1965 and opened our first franchised store in 1967 the first international stores opened in 1983 in canada and australia 

monaghan sold 93 of his economic stake in the company in 1998 through a leveraged buyout transaction with bain capital llc he sold and transferred his remaining stake in the company in 2004 when we completed our initial public offering in connection with the initial public offering on may 11 2004 we reincorporated in delaware 

since 1998 the company has been structured with a leveraged balance sheet and has completed a number of recapitalization events the company’s most recent recapitalization transaction in 2012 the “2012 recapitalization” primarily consisted of 

 

  

  

  

 we relaunched our brand in the us in late 2009 by introducing a new recipe for our core pizza product since 2008 the majority of our menu has changed either through the improvement of existing products or the introduction of new products such as our handmade pan pizza and specialty chicken globally we opened our 10000 th store in 2012 and our 11000 th store in 2014 in 2013 we announced a plan requiring all stores to adopt our new “pizza theater” store design which is more inviting to customers and allows them to see their orders being made fresh in front of them our goal is to be substantially complete with these remodels by the end of 2017 

  

our industry 

the us qsr pizza category is large and fragmented from 2004 through 2014 the us qsr pizza category has grown from 311 billion to 329 billion it is the thirdlargest category within the 2619 billion us qsr sector the us qsr pizza category is primarily comprised of delivery dinein and carryout 

we compete primarily in the delivery and carryout segments of the pizza industry we are the market share leader in the delivery segment and we have the second largest share in the carryout segment 2014 delivery segment sales of 100 billion down from 112 billion in 2004 account for approximately 31 of total us qsr pizza while the delivery segment declined during the period from 2004 to 2012 sales increased slightly during the past two years from 96 billion in 2012 to 100 billion in 2014 the three industry leaders including domino’s account for approximately 55 of us pizza delivery based on reported consumer spending with the remaining sales going to regional chains and independent establishments from 2004 to 2014 the carryout segment grew from 122 billion to 148 billion the four industry leaders including domino’s account for approximately 41 of the carryout segment 

in contrast to the united states international pizza delivery is relatively underdeveloped with only domino’s and three other competitors having a significant global presence we believe that demand for pizza and pizza delivery is large and growing throughout the world driven by international consumers’ increasing emphasis on convenience and the proven success of our 30 years of conducting business abroad 

our competition 

the global pizza delivery and carryout segments are highly competitive in the us we compete against regional and local companies as well as national chains pizza hut ®  papa john’s ® and little caesars pizza ®  internationally we compete primarily with pizza hut ®  papa john’s ® and countryspecific national and local pizzerias we generally compete on the basis of product quality location image service and price we and our competitors can be affected by changes in consumer tastes economic conditions demographic trends and consumers’ disposable income we compete not only for customers but also for employees suitable real estate sites and qualified franchisees 

our customers 

the company’s business is not dependent upon a single retail customer or small group of customers including franchisees no customer accounted for more than 10 of total consolidated revenues in 2014 2013 or 2012 our largest franchisee based on store count domino’s pizza enterprises asx dmp operates 1411 stores in six international markets and accounts for 12 of our total store count royalty revenues from this franchisee accounted for 16 of our consolidated revenues in 2014 our international business unit only requires a minimal amount of general and administrative expenses to operate its markets and does not have costs of sales therefore the vast majority of these royalty revenues result in profits to us 

our menu 

we offer a menu designed to present an attractive quality offering to customers while keeping it simple enough to minimize order errors and expedite ordertaking and food preparation our basic menu features pizza products with varying sizes and crust types our typical store also offers ovenbaked sandwiches pasta boneless chicken and wings bread side items desserts and cocacola ® soft drink products international markets vary toppings by country and culture such as squid toppings in japan or spicy cheese in india and often feature regional specialty items such as a banana and cinnamon dessert pizza in brazil 

store image and operations 

we have been focused primarily on pizza delivery for over 50 years and also on carryout as a significant component of our business in 2012 we introduced our carryoutfriendly pizza theater store design we expect that substantially all of our stores will convert to this design by the end of 2017 many stores will offer casual seating and will enable customers to watch the preparation of their orders but will not offer a fullservice dinein experience as a result our stores generally do not require expensive restaurant facilities and staffing 

research and development 

we conduct research and product development at our world resource center in ann arbor michigan companysponsored research and development activities which include testing new products for possible menu additions are an important activity for us and our franchisees we do not consider the amounts spent on research and development to be material 

  

our business segments 

historically we have operated in and reported three business segments domestic stores international and domestic supply chain in the fourth quarter of 2014 several organizational changes were made within the company’s management structure with one of the changes impacting the management of our supply chain operations as a result management determined that our previous domestic supply chain segment and the international supply chain operations division of our previous international segment should be combined into a new global supply chain segment as a result we now report the following three business segments domestic stores international franchise and supply chain while the consolidated results of the company have not been impacted by this change in our reportable segments we have restated our historical segment information in order to provide readers of our financial statements with a consistent presentation 

domestic stores 

our domestic stores segment consists primarily of our franchise operations through which we oversee a network of 4690 franchised stores located in the contiguous united states we also operate a network of 377 domestic companyowned stores located in the contiguous united states 

during 2014 our domestic stores segment accounted for 5787 million or 29 of our consolidated revenues we use our companyowned stores as test sites for new products and promotions as well as operational improvements we also use them for training new store managers and operations team members as well as developing prospective franchisees while we are primarily a franchised business we evaluate our mix of domestic companyowned and franchise stores in an effort to optimize our longterm profitability 

we maintain a productive relationship with our independent franchise owners through regional franchise teams distributing materials that help franchise stores comply with our standards and using franchise advisory groups that facilitate communications between us and our franchisees 

domestic franchise profile 

as of december 28 2014 our 4690 domestic franchise stores were owned and operated by 899 domestic franchisees our franchise formula enables franchisees to benefit from our brand name with a relatively low initial capital investment as of december 28 2014 the average domestic franchisee owned and operated five stores and had been in our franchise system for over 16 years at the same time 12 of our domestic franchisees operated more than 50 stores including our largest domestic franchisee who operated 140 stores and 340 of our domestic franchisees each operated one store 

we apply rigorous standards to prospective domestic franchisees we generally require them to manage a store for at least one year before being granted a franchise this enables us to observe the operational and financial performance of a potential franchisee prior to entering into a longterm contract in the us today approximately 90 of our 899 independent franchise owners started their careers with us as delivery drivers or in other instore positions we generally restrict the ability of domestic franchisees to be involved in other businesses which focuses our franchisees’ attention on operating their stores as a result the majority of our domestic franchisees have historically come from within the domino’s pizza system we believe these standards are largely unique to the franchise industry and result in qualified and focused franchisees operating their stores 

domestic franchise agreements 

we enter into franchise agreements with domestic franchisees under which the franchisee is granted the right to operate a store in a particular location for a term of 10 years with an ability to renew for an additional term of 10 years we have a franchise contract renewal rate of approximately 99 under the current standard franchise agreement we assign an exclusive area of primary responsibility to each franchised store each franchisee is generally required to pay a 55 royalty fee on sales occasionally we will collect lower rates based on area development agreements sales initiatives and new store incentives 

our domestic stores currently contribute 6 of their retail sales to fund national marketing and advertising campaigns subject in limited instances to lower rates based on certain incentives and waivers these funds are administered by domino’s national advertising fund inc or dnaf our notforprofit advertising subsidiary the funds are primarily used to purchase media for advertising but also support market research field communications public relations commercial production talent payments and other activities to promote the brand in addition to the national and marketlevel advertising contributions domestic stores spend additional funds on local store marketing activities 

  

we have the contractual right subject to state law to terminate a franchise agreement for a variety of reasons including but not limited to a franchisee’s failure to adhere to the company’s franchise agreement failure to make required payments or failure to adhere to specified company policies and standards 

international franchise 

our international franchise segment is comprised of a network of franchised stores in more than 75 international markets at december 28 2014 we had 6562 international franchise stores during 2014 this segment accounted for 1526 million or 8 of our consolidated revenues the principal sources of revenues from those operations are royalty payments generated by retail sales from franchised stores 

our international franchisees employ our basic standard operating model and adapt it to satisfy the local eating habits and consumer preferences of various regions outside the united states currently the vast majority of our international stores operate under master franchise agreements 

we believe domino’s appeals to potential international franchisees because of our recognized brand name and technological leadership the moderate capital expenditures required to open and operate our stores and our system’s favorable store economics in our top 10 markets four master franchise companies are publicly traded on stock exchanges in australia asx dmp india jublfood ns mexico alsea mx and the united kingdom dom l the following table shows our store count as of december 28 2014 in our top 10 international markets which account for approximately 73 of our international stores

the vast majority of our markets outside of the contiguous united states are operated by master franchisees with franchise and distribution rights for entire regions or countries in a few select markets we franchise directly to individual store operators prospective master franchisees are required to possess local market knowledge to establish and develop domino’s pizza stores with the ability to identify and access targeted real estate sites as well as expertise in local laws customs culture and consumer behavior we also seek candidates that have access to sufficient capital to meet growth and development plans 

master franchise agreements 

our master franchise agreements generally grant the franchisee exclusive rights to develop or subfranchise stores and the right to operate supply chain centers in particular geographic areas agreements are generally for a term of 10 to 20 years with options to renew for additional terms the agreements typically contain growth clauses requiring franchisees to open a minimum number of stores within a specified period the master franchisee is generally required to pay an initial onetime franchise fee as well as an additional franchise fee upon the opening of each new store the master franchisee is also required to pay a continuing royalty fee as a percentage of retail sales which varies among international markets and averaged approximately 31 in 2014 

supply chain 

our supply chain segment operates 16 regional dough manufacturing and food supply chain centers in the contiguous us one thin crust manufacturing center one vegetable processing center and one center providing equipment and supplies to certain of our domestic and international stores we also operate seven dough manufacturing and food supply chain centers in canada alaska and hawaii our supply chain segment leases a fleet of more than 500 tractors and trailers during 2014 our supply chain segment accounted for 126 billion or 63 of our consolidated revenues 

  

our centers manufacture fresh dough and purchase receive store and deliver quality food and other complementary items to over 99 of our us and canadian franchised stores and all of our companyowned stores we regularly supply nearly 5500 stores with various food and supplies our supply chain segment made approximately 571000 fullservice deliveries in 2014 or approximately two deliveries per store per week and we produced over 340 million pounds of dough during 2014 

we believe our franchisees voluntarily choose to obtain food supplies and equipment from us because we offer the most efficient convenient and costeffective alternative while also offering both quality and consistency our supply chain segment offers profitsharing arrangements to franchisees who purchase all of their food for their stores from our centers these profitsharing arrangements generally offer participating franchisees and companyowned stores with 50 or a higher percentage in the case of companyowned stores and certain franchisees who operate a larger number of stores of their regional supply chain center’s pretax profits we believe these arrangements strengthen our ties and provide aligned benefits with franchisees 

thirdparty suppliers 

over half of our annual food spend is with suppliers where we have maintained a partnership of at least 20 years our supply partners are required to meet strict quality standards to ensure food safety we review and evaluate these partners’ quality assurance programs through among other actions onsite visits third party audits and product evaluations to ensure compliance with our standards we believe the length and quality of our relationships with thirdparty suppliers provides us with priority service and quality products at competitive prices 

cheese is our largest food cost the price we charge to our domestic franchisees for cheese is based on the chicago mercantile exchange cheddar block price plus a supply chain markup as cheese prices fluctuate our revenues and margin percentages in our supply chain segment also fluctuate however actual supply chain dollar margins remain unchanged we currently purchase our domestic pizza cheese from a single supplier under the september 2012 agreement our domestic supplier agreed to provide an uninterrupted supply of cheese and the company agreed to a fiveyear pricing schedule to purchase all of its domestic pizza cheese from this supplier while we expect to meet the terms of this agreement if we do not we will be required to repay the cost savings as outlined in the agreement the majority of our meat toppings in the us come from a single supplier under a contract that began in may 2014 and expires in november 2015 we have the right to terminate these arrangements for quality failures and for uncured breaches 

we are party to a multiyear agreement with cocacola for the contiguous united states this contract renegotiated in december 2013 provides for cocacola to continue to be our exclusive beverage supplier and expires on december 31 2018 or at such time as a minimum number of cases of cocacola products are purchased by us whichever occurs last 

we believe alternative thirdparty suppliers are available for all of these referenced products while we may incur additional costs if we are required to replace any of our supply partners we do not believe such additional costs would have a material adverse effect on our business we continually evaluate each supply category to determine the optimal sourcing strategy 

we have not experienced any significant shortages of supplies or delays in receiving our inventories or products prices charged to us by our supply partners are subject to fluctuation and we have historically been able to pass increased costs and savings on to our stores we periodically enter into supplier contracts to manage the risk from changes in commodity prices we do not engage in speculative transactions nor do we hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes 

our strengths 

strong brand equity 

we are the second largest pizza company in the world we believe our domino’s pizza ® brand is one of the most widelyrecognized consumer brands in the world we are the recognized world leader in pizza delivery and have a significant business in carryout we believe consumers associate our brand with the timely delivery of quality affordable food 

over the past five years our us franchise and companyowned stores have invested an estimated 14 billion in national cooperative and local advertising our international franchisees also invest significant amounts in advertising efforts in their markets we continue to reinforce our brand with extensive advertising through various media channels we have also enhanced the strength of our brand through marketing affiliations with brands such as cocacola 

  

we are the number one pizza delivery company in the united states with a 247 share of pizza delivery based on reported consumer spending with 5067 stores located in the contiguous united states our store delivery areas cover a majority of us households our share position and scale allow us to leverage our purchasing power supply chain strength and marketing investments we believe our scale and market coverage allow us to effectively serve our customers’ demands for convenience and timely delivery outside the us we have significant market share positions in many of the markets in which we compete 

strong and proven business model 

our business model is comprised of domestic and international franchise royalties revenues from supply chain and revenue from retail sales at companyowned stores we have developed this model over our many years of operation and it is anchored by strong storelevel economics which provide an entrepreneurial incentive for our franchisees and historically has generated demand for new stores our franchise system in turn has produced strong and consistent earnings for us through royalty fees and through supply chain revenues with moderate associated capital expenditures by us 

we developed a costefficient store model characterized by a delivery and carryoutoriented store design with moderate capital requirements and a menu of quality affordable items at the store level we believe the simplicity and efficiency of our operations give us significant advantages over our competitors who in many cases also focus on dinein or have broader menu offerings at the supply chain level we believe we provide quality and consistency for our franchise customers while also driving profits for us which we share with our franchisees 

our menu simplifies and streamlines production and delivery processes and maximizes economies of scale on purchases of our principal food items in addition our stores are small averaging approximately 1500 square feet and less expensive to build furnish and maintain as compared to many other restaurant concepts the combination of this efficient store model and strong sales volume has resulted in strong storelevel financial returns and we believe makes domino’s pizza an attractive business opportunity for existing and prospective franchisees around the world 

we believe our store economics have led to a strong welldiversified franchise system this established franchise system has produced strong cash flow and earnings for us enabling us to invest in the domino’s pizza ® brand stores technology and supply chain centers pay significant dividends repurchase and retire shares of our common stock and repurchase and retire outstanding principal on our fixed rate notes 

technological innovation 

technological innovation is vital to our brand and our longterm success digital ordering is critical to competing in the global pizza industry in 2014 nearly 45 of our us sales came via digital platforms that metric is higher in some of our international markets we believe we are among the largest ecommerce retailers in terms of annual transactions after launching digital ordering domestically in 2008 we made the strategic decision in 2010 to develop our own online ordering platform and to manage this important and growing area of our business internally over the next four years we launched mobile applications that cover 95 of the smartphones and tablets on the us market in 2013 we launched an enhanced online ordering profiles platform allowing customers the ability to reorder their favorite order in as few as five clicks or 30 seconds in 2014 we introduced “dom” a voice ordering application which we believe is the first in the restaurant industry and we also made the domino’s tracker ® available on the pebble smartwatch platform 

all of this improved functionality has been developed to work seamlessly with our domino’s pulse™ pointofsale system our domino’s pulse system is designed to improve operating efficiencies for our franchisees and our corporate management and assist franchisees in independently managing their business we have installed domino’s pulse in every companyowned store in the us in more than 99 of our domestic franchised stores and in nearly 60 of our international stores 

we believe utilizing domino’s pulse with our integrated mobile applications throughout our system provides us with competitive advantages over other concepts we intend to continue to enhance and grow our online ordering digital marketing and technological capabilities 

  

product innovation 

in late 2009 we reintroduced our core pizza with a new recipe which we believe has been key to our continued growth in customer reorder rate consumer traffic and increased sales this recipe is now in use in the vast majority of markets around the world our more than 50 years of innovation have resulted in numerous new product developments including our recent innovations of handmade pan pizza specialty chicken parmesan bread bites and stuffed cheesy bread among others product innovation is also present in our global markets where our master franchisees have the ability to recommend products to suit their local market tastes products include the mayo jaga in japan bacon potatoes and sweet mayonnaise and the saumoneta in france light cream potatoes onions smoked salmon and dill 

internal dough manufacturing and supply chain system 

in addition to generating significant revenues and earnings in the united states and canada we believe our vertically integrated dough manufacturing and supply chain system enhances the quality and consistency of our products enhances our relationships with franchisees and leverages economies of scale to offer lower costs to our stores it also allows store managers to better focus on store operations and customer service by relieving them of the responsibility of mixing dough in the stores and sourcing other ingredients many of our international master franchisees also profit from running supply chain businesses 

our ideals 

we believe in opportunity hard work inspired solutions winning together embracing community and uncommon honesty 

opportunity abounds at domino’s you can start in an entrylevel position and become a store owner – in fact 90 of our independent franchise owners in the us started their careers with us as delivery drivers or in other instore positions thousands of other team members – supervisors trainers quality auditors international business consultants marketers and executives – also began their careers in the stores internal growth and providing opportunities for anyone willing to work hard is the foundation of our core beliefs 

the ideals of inspired solutions uncommon honesty and winning together were driving forces behind the relaunch of our brand we were inspired by our harshest critics when it came to the perceived taste of our pizza our solution was not simply more advertising the solution was to create a new recipe and a broader menu of greattasting products our marketing campaign was shockingly honest in its approach telling consumers and showing them via television ads that we heard their negative feedback and were listening and without the buyin from our franchise owners we couldn’t have done it we believe that we can’t focus solely on the company’s success we must focus on making our stores and our franchisees successful that’s winning together 

community involvement 

we believe in supporting the communities we serve through donating our time money and pizza you can find more information about our community giving at bizdominoscom  here are two organizations worthy of note

we are also subject to the fair labor standards act and various other federal and state laws governing such matters as minimum wage requirements overtime and other working conditions and citizenship requirements a significant number of our and our franchisees’ food service personnel are paid at rates related to the applicable minimum wage and past increases in the minimum wage have increased labor costs as would future increases

 item 1a risk factors 

the quick service restaurant pizza category is highly competitive and such competition could adversely affect our operating results 

in the us we compete against regional and local companies as well as national chains pizza hut ®  papa john’s ® and little caesars pizza ®  internationally we compete primarily with pizza hut ®  papa john’s ® and countryspecific national and local pizzerias we could experience increased competition from existing or new companies in the pizza category which could create increasing pressures to grow our business in order to maintain our market share if we are unable to maintain our competitive position we could experience downward pressure on prices lower demand for our products reduced margins the inability to take advantage of new business opportunities and the loss of market share all of which would have an adverse effect on our operating results and could cause our stock price to decline 

we also compete on a broader scale with quick service and other international national regional and local restaurants the overall food service market and the quick service restaurant sector are intensely competitive with respect to food quality price service image convenience and concept and are often affected by changes in 

 

  

  

  

  

 we compete within the food service market and the quick service restaurant sector not only for customers but also for management and hourly employees suitable real estate sites and qualified franchisees our supply chain segment is also subject to competition from outside suppliers while over 99 of domestic franchisees purchased food equipment and supplies from us in 2014 domestic franchisees are not required to purchase food equipment or supplies from us and they may choose to purchase from outside suppliers if other suppliers who meet our qualification standards were to offer lower prices or better service to our franchisees for their ingredients and supplies and as a result our franchisees chose not to purchase from our domestic supply chain centers our financial condition business and results of operations would be adversely affected 

if we fail to successfully implement our growth strategy which includes opening new domestic and international stores our ability to increase our revenues and operating profits could be adversely affected 

a significant component of our growth strategy includes the opening of new domestic and international stores we and our franchisees face many challenges in opening new stores including among others 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 the opening of additional franchise stores also depends in part upon the availability of prospective franchisees who meet our criteria our failure to add a significant number of new stores would adversely affect our ability to increase revenues and operating income 

we and our franchisees are currently planning to expand our international operations in many of the markets where we currently operate and in selected new markets this may require considerable management time as well as startup expenses for market development before any significant revenues and earnings are generated operations in new foreign markets may achieve low margins or may be unprofitable and expansion in existing markets may be affected by local economic and market conditions therefore as we expand internationally we or our franchisees may not experience the operating margins we expect our results of operations may be negatively impacted and our common stock price may decline 

we may also pursue strategic acquisitions as part of our business if we are able to identify acquisition candidates such acquisitions may be financed to the extent permitted under our debt agreements with substantial debt or with potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities 

  

the food service market is affected by consumer preferences and perceptions changes in these preferences and perceptions may lessen the demand for our products which would reduce sales and harm our business 

food service businesses are affected by changes in consumer tastes international national regional and local economic conditions and demographic trends for instance if prevailing health or dietary preferences cause consumers to avoid pizza and other products we offer in favor of foods that are perceived as more healthy our business and operating results would be harmed moreover because we are primarily dependent on a single product if consumer demand for pizza should decrease our business would suffer more than if we had a more diversified menu as many other food service businesses do 

reports of foodborne illness or food tampering could reduce sales and harm our business 

reports whether true or not of foodborne illnesses such as e coli avian flu bovine spongiform encephalopathy hepatitis a trichinosis or salmonella and injuries caused by food tampering have in the past severely injured the reputations of participants in the qsr sector and could in the future as well the potential for acts of terrorism on our global food supply also exists and if such an event occurs it could have a negative impact on us and could severely hurt sales and profits in addition our reputation is an important asset as a result anything that damages our reputation could immediately and severely affect our sales and profits media reports of illnesses and injuries whether accurate or not could force some stores to close or otherwise reduce sales at such stores in addition reports of foodborne illnesses or food tampering even those occurring solely at the restaurants of competitors could by resulting in negative publicity about the restaurant industry adversely affect us on a local regional national or international basis 

increases in food labor and other costs could adversely affect our profitability and operating results 

an increase in our operating costs could adversely affect our profitability factors such as inflation increased food costs increased labor and employee health and benefit costs increased rent costs and increased energy costs may adversely affect our operating costs most of the factors affecting costs are beyond our control and in many cases we may not be able to pass along these increased costs to our customers or franchisees most ingredients used in our pizza particularly cheese are subject to significant price fluctuations as a result of seasonality weather demand and other factors the cheese block price per pound averaged 213 in 2014 and the estimated increase in companyowned store food costs from a hypothetical 025 adverse change in the average cheese block price per pound would have been approximately 22 million in 2014 labor costs are largely a function of the minimum wage for a majority of our store personnel and certain supply chain center personnel and generally are also a function of the availability of labor food including cheese costs and labor represent approximately 50 to 60 of a typical companyowned store’s sales 

we do not have longterm contracts with certain of our suppliers and as a result they could seek to significantly increase prices or fail to deliver 

we do not have longterm contracts or arrangements with certain of our suppliers although in the past we have not experienced significant problems with our suppliers our suppliers may implement significant price increases or may not meet our requirements in a timely fashion or at all the occurrence of any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

shortages or interruptions in the supply or delivery of fresh food products could adversely affect our operating results 

we and our franchisees are dependent on frequent deliveries of fresh food products that meet our specifications shortages or interruptions in the supply of fresh food products caused by unanticipated demand problems in production or distribution financial or other difficulties of suppliers inclement weather or other conditions could adversely affect the availability quality and cost of ingredients which would adversely affect our operating results 

any prolonged disruption in the operations of any of our dough manufacturing and supply chain centers could harm our business 

we operate 16 regional dough manufacturing and supply chain centers one thin crust manufacturing center and one vegetable processing center in the contiguous united states and a total of seven dough manufacturing and supply chain centers in alaska hawaii and canada our domestic dough manufacturing and supply chain centers service all of our companyowned stores and over 99 of our domestic franchise stores as a result any prolonged disruption in the operations of any of these facilities whether due to technical or labor difficulties destruction or damage to the facility real estate issues or other reasons could adversely affect our business and operating results 

  

our success depends in part upon effective advertising and lower advertising funds may reduce our ability to adequately market the domino’s pizza ® brand 

we have been routinely named a megabrand by advertising age each domino’s store located in the contiguous united states is obligated to pay a percentage of its sales in advertising fees in fiscal 2014 each store in the contiguous united states generally was required to contribute 6 of their sales to dnaf subject in limited instances to lower rates based on certain incentives and waivers which uses such fees for national advertising in addition to contributions for local marketlevel advertising we currently anticipate that this 6 contribution rate will remain in place for the foreseeable future while additional funds for advertising in the past have been provided by us our franchisees and other third parties none of these additional funds are legally required the lack of continued financial support for advertising activities could significantly curtail our marketing efforts which may in turn materially and adversely affect our business and our operating results 

we face risks of litigation and negative publicity from customers franchisees suppliers employees and others in the ordinary course of business which can or could divert our financial and management resources any adverse litigation or publicity may negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations 

claims of illness or injury relating to food quality or food handling are common in the food service industry and vehicular accidents and injuries occur in the food delivery business claims within our industry of improper supplier actions have also recently arisen that if made against one of our suppliers could potentially damage our brand image in addition class action lawsuits have been filed and may continue to be filed against various quick service restaurants alleging among other things that quick service restaurants have failed to disclose the health risks associated with highfat foods and that quick service restaurant marketing practices have encouraged obesity in addition to decreasing our sales and profitability and diverting our management resources adverse publicity or a substantial judgment against us could negatively impact our financial condition results of operations and brand reputation thereby hindering our ability to attract and retain franchisees and grow our business 

further we may be subject to employee franchisee and other claims in the future based on among other things discrimination harassment wrongful termination and wage rest break and meal break issues and those claims relating to overtime compensation we are currently subject to these types of claims and have been subject to these types of claims in the past if one or more of these claims were to be successful or if there is a significant increase in the number of these claims or if we receive significant negative publicity our business financial condition and operating results could be harmed 

loss of key employees or our inability to attract and retain new qualified employees could hurt our business and inhibit our ability to operate and grow successfully 

our success in the highly competitive pizza delivery and carryout business will continue to depend to a significant extent on our leadership team and other key management personnel other than with our president and chief executive officer j patrick doyle we do not have longterm employment agreements with any of our executive officers as a result we may not be able to retain our executive officers and key personnel or attract additional qualified management while we do not have longterm employment agreements with our executive officers for all of our executive officers we have noncompete and nonsolicitation agreements that extend for 24 months following the termination of such executive officer’s employment our success also will continue to depend on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel to operate our stores dough manufacturing and supply chain centers and international operations the loss of these employees or our inability to recruit and retain qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 

adverse global economic conditions subject us to additional risk 

our financial condition and results of operations are impacted by global markets and economic conditions over which neither we nor our franchisees have control an economic downturn including further deterioration in the economic conditions in european countries may result in a reduction in the demand for our products longer payment cycles slower adoption of new technologies and increased price competition poor economic conditions may adversely affect the ability of our franchisees to pay royalties or amounts owed and could have a material adverse impact on our ability to pursue our growth strategy which would reduce cash collections and in turn may materially and adversely affect our ability to service our debt obligations 

our international operations subject us to additional risk such risks and costs may differ in each country in which we and our franchisees do business and may cause our profitability to decline due to increased costs 

we conduct a significant and growing portion of our business outside the united states our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected if global markets in which our franchise stores compete are affected by changes in political economic or other factors these factors over which neither we nor our franchisees have control may include 

 

   

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 fluctuations in the value of the us dollar in relation to other currencies may lead to lower revenues and earnings 

exchange rate fluctuations could have an adverse effect on our results of operations approximately 77 of our total revenues in 2014 74 of our total revenues in 2013 and 71 of our total revenues in 2012 were derived from our international franchise segment a majority of which were denominated in foreign currencies we also operate dough manufacturing and distribution facilities in canada which generate revenues denominated in canadian dollars sales made by franchise stores outside the united states are denominated in the currency of the country in which the store is located and this currency could become less valuable in us dollars as a result of exchange rate fluctuations unfavorable currency fluctuations could lead to increased prices to customers outside the united states or lower profitability to our franchisees outside the united states or could result in lower revenues for us on a us dollar basis from such customers and franchisees a hypothetical 10 adverse change in the foreign currency rates in our international markets would have resulted in a negative impact on international royalty revenues of approximately 147 million in 2014 

we may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property which could harm the value of our brand and branded products and adversely affect our business 

we depend in large part on our brand and branded products and believe that they are very important to our business we rely on a combination of trademarks copyrights service marks trade secrets and similar intellectual property rights to protect our brand and branded products the success of our business depends on our continued ability to use our existing trademarks and service marks in order to increase brand awareness and further develop our branded products in both domestic and international markets we have registered certain trademarks and have other trademark registrations pending in the united states and foreign jurisdictions not all of the trademarks that we currently use have been registered in all of the countries in which we do business and they may never be registered in all of these countries we may not be able to adequately protect our trademarks and our use of these trademarks may result in liability for trademark infringement trademark dilution or unfair competition all of the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property in the united states and in foreign countries may not be adequate in addition the laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states further through acquisitions of third parties we may acquire brands and related trademarks that are subject to the same risks as the brands and trademarks we currently own 

we may from time to time be required to institute litigation to enforce our trademarks or other intellectual property rights or to protect our trade secrets such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could negatively affect our sales profitability and prospects regardless of whether we are able to successfully enforce our rights 

our earnings and business growth strategy depends on the success of our franchisees and we may be harmed by actions taken by our franchisees or employees of our franchisees that are outside of our control 

a significant portion of our earnings comes from royalties generated by our franchise stores franchisees are independent operators and their employees are not our employees we provide tools for franchisees to use in training their employees but the quality of franchise store operations may be diminished by any number of factors beyond our control consequently franchisees may not successfully operate stores in a manner consistent with our standards and requirements if they do not our image and reputation may suffer and as a result our revenues and stock price could decline while we try to ensure that our franchisees maintain the quality of our brand and branded products our franchisees may take actions that adversely affect the value of our intellectual property or reputation as of december 28 2014 we had 899 domestic franchisees operating 4690 domestic stores 12 of these franchisees each operate over 50 domestic stores including our largest domestic franchisee who operates 140 stores and the average franchisee owns and operates five stores 

  

in addition our international master franchisees are generally responsible for the development of significantly more stores than our domestic franchisees as a result our international operations are more closely tied to the success of a smaller number of franchisees than our domestic operations our largest international master franchisee operates 1411 stores in six markets which accounts for approximately 22 of our total international store count our domestic and international franchisees may not operate their franchises successfully if one or more of our key franchisees were to become insolvent or otherwise were unable or unwilling to pay us our royalties or other amounts owed our business and results of operations would be adversely affected 

interruption failure or compromise of our information technology communications systems and electronic data could hurt our ability to effectively serve our customers and protect customer data which could damage our reputation and adversely affect our business and operating results 

a significant portion of our retail sales depends on the continuing operation of our information technology and communications systems including but not limited to domino’s pulse™ our online ordering platforms and our credit card processing systems our information technology communication systems and electronic data may be vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes terrorist attacks floods fires power loss telecommunications failures computer viruses loss of data unauthorized data breaches or other attempts to harm our systems additionally we operate data centers that are also subject to breakins sabotage and intentional acts of vandalism that could cause disruptions in our ability to serve our customers and protect customer data some of our systems are not fully redundant and our disaster recovery planning cannot account for all eventualities the occurrence of a natural disaster intentional sabotage or other unanticipated problems could result in lengthy interruptions in our service any errors or vulnerabilities in our systems or damage to or failure of our systems could result in interruptions in our services and noncompliance with certain regulations which could reduce our revenues and profits and damage our business and brand 

we rely on proprietary and commercially available systems software tools and monitoring to provide security for processing transmission and storage of confidential customer information such as payment card and personal information and any unauthorized data breaches could damage our reputation and adversely affect our business  

unauthorized intrusion into the portions of our computer systems or those of our franchisees that process and store information related to customer transactions may result in the theft of customer data furthermore the systems currently used for transmission and approval of payment card transactions and the technology utilized in payment cards themselves all of which can put payment card data at risk are determined and mandated by payment card industry standards not by us in addition to improper activities by third parties bugs in newlydeployed or early stage advances in hardware and software capabilities encryption technology and other events or developments may facilitate or result in a compromise or breach of our computer systems any such compromises or breaches could cause interruptions in operations and damage to the reputation of the domino’s pizza ® brand subject us to costs and liabilities and hurt sales revenues and profits 

we are subject to extensive government regulation and requirements issued by other groups and our failure to comply with existing or increased regulations could adversely affect our business and operating results 

we are subject to numerous federal state local and foreign laws and regulations as well as requirements issued by other groups including those relating to 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 the patient protection and affordable care act and subsequent amendments require employers such as us to provide health insurance for all qualifying employees or pay penalties for not providing coverage we anticipate that the majority of the increases in these costs will begin in 2015 and will escalate in subsequent years while we do not expect the incremental costs of this program to be material to us these costs will likely have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position as well as an adverse effect on some of our larger franchisees 

  

we may also become subject to legislation or regulation seeking to tax andor regulate highfat foods foods with high sugar and salt content or foods otherwise deemed to be “unhealthy” if we fail to comply with existing or future laws and regulations we may be subject to governmental or judicial fines or sanctions in addition our capital expenditures could increase due to remediation measures that may be required if we are found to be noncompliant with any of these laws or regulations 

we are also subject to a federal trade commission rule and to various state and foreign laws that govern the offer and sale of franchises additionally these laws regulate various aspects of the franchise relationship including terminations and the refusal to renew franchises the failure to comply with these laws and regulations in any jurisdiction or to obtain required government approvals could result in a ban or temporary suspension on future franchise sales fines or other penalties or require us to make offers of rescission or restitution any of which could adversely affect our business and operating results 

our current insurance coverage may not be adequate insurance premiums for such coverage may increase and we may not be able to obtain insurance at acceptable rates or at all 

we have retention programs for workers’ compensation general liability and owned and nonowned automobile liabilities we are generally responsible for up to 10 million per occurrence under these retention programs for workers’ compensation and general liability we are also generally responsible for between 500000 and 30 million per occurrence under these retention programs for owned and nonowned automobile liabilities total insurance limits under these retention programs vary depending upon the period covered and range up to 1100 million per occurrence for general liability and owned and nonowned automobile liabilities and up to the applicable statutory limits for workers’ compensation these insurance policies may not be adequate to protect us from liabilities that we incur in our business in addition in the future our insurance premiums may increase and we may not be able to obtain similar levels of insurance on reasonable terms or at all any such inadequacy of or inability to obtain insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our annual and quarterly financial results are subject to significant fluctuations depending on various factors many of which are beyond our control and if we fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors our share price may decline significantly 

our sales and operating results can vary significantly from quartertoquarter and yeartoyear depending on various factors many of which are beyond our control these factors include among other things 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 as a result our operational performance may decline quickly and significantly in response to changes in order patterns or rapid decreases in demand for our products we anticipate that fluctuations in operating results will continue in the future 

our common stock price could be subject to significant fluctuations andor may decline 

the market price of our common stock could be subject to significant fluctuations among the factors that could affect our stock price are 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 the stock markets in general have experienced volatility that has sometimes been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies these broad market fluctuations may cause the trading price of our common stock to decline 

  

our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our business and limit our ability to plan for or respond to changes in our business 

we have a substantial amount of indebtedness as of december 28 2014 our consolidated longterm indebtedness was approximately 152 billion we may also incur additional debt which would not be prohibited under the terms of our current securitized debt agreements our substantial indebtedness could have important consequences to our business and our shareholders for example it could 

 

  

  

  

 in addition the financial and other covenants we agreed to with our lenders may limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness make investments pay dividends and engage in other transactions and the leverage may cause potential lenders to be less willing to loan funds to us in the future our failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default that if not cured or waived could result in the acceleration of repayment of all of our indebtedness 

we may be unable to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our significant debt service obligations which would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

our ability to make principal and interest payments on and to refinance our indebtedness will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future this to a certain extent is subject to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control if our business does not generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the amounts projected or at all or if future borrowings are not available to us under our variable funding notes in amounts sufficient to fund our other liquidity needs our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected if we cannot generate sufficient cash flow from operations to make scheduled principal amortization and interest payments on our debt obligations in the future we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity sell assets delay capital expenditures or seek additional equity if we are unable to refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all or to effect any other action relating to our indebtedness on satisfactory terms or at all our business may be harmed 

the terms of our securitized debt financing of certain of our whollyowned subsidiaries have restrictive terms and our failure to comply with any of these terms could put us in default which would have an adverse effect on our business and prospects 

unless and until we repay all outstanding borrowings under our securitized debt we will remain subject to the restrictive terms of these borrowings the securitized debt under which certain of our whollyowned subsidiaries issued and guaranteed fixed rate notes and variable funding senior revolving notes contain a number of covenants with the most significant financial covenant being a debt service coverage calculation these covenants limit the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to among other things 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 the securitized debt also requires us to maintain specified financial ratios at the end of each fiscal quarter these restrictions could affect our ability to pay dividends or repurchase shares of our common stock our ability to meet these financial ratios can be affected by events beyond our control and we may not satisfy such a test a breach of this covenant could result in a rapid amortization event or default under the securitized debt if amounts owed under the securitized debt are accelerated because of a default under the securitized debt and we are unable to pay such amounts the investors may have the right to assume control of substantially all of the securitized assets 

  

during the sevenyear term following issuance the outstanding senior notes will accrue interest at a fixed rate of 5216 per year additionally the senior notes have original scheduled principal amortization payments of 295 million in 2015 374 million in 2016 394 million in each of 2017 and 2018 and 98 million in 2019 in accordance with our debt agreements once we meet certain conditions including maximum leverage ratios as defined of less than or equal to 45x total debt to ebitda we cease to make the scheduled principal amortization payments if one of the defined leverage ratios subsequently exceeds 45x we must makeup the payments we had previously not made during the second quarter of 2014 we met the maximum leverage ratios of less than 45x and in accordance with our debt agreements ceased debt amortization payments in the third quarter of 2014 we continued to meet the maximum leverage ratios of less than 45x in the third and fourth quarters of 2014 and currently do not plan to make previously scheduled debt amortization payments as permitted in our debt agreements 

if we are unable to refinance or repay amounts under the securitized debt prior to the expiration of the sevenyear term our cash flow would be directed to the repayment of the securitized debt and other than a weekly management fee sufficient to cover minimal selling general and administrative expenses would not be available for operating our business 

no assurance can be given that any refinancing or additional financing will be possible when needed or that we will be able to negotiate acceptable terms in addition our access to capital is affected by prevailing conditions in the financial and capital markets and other factors beyond our control there can be no assurance that market conditions will be favorable at the times that we require new or additional financing 

the indenture governing the securitized debt will restrict the cash flow from the entities subject to the securitization to any of our other entities and upon the occurrence of certain events cash flow would be further restricted 

in the event that a rapid amortization event occurs under the indenture including without limitation upon an event of default under the indenture or the failure to repay the securitized debt at the end of the sevenyear term the funds available to us would be reduced or eliminated which would in turn reduce our ability to operate or grow our business

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

overview 

our fiscal year typically includes 52 weeks comprised of three twelveweek quarters and one sixteenweek quarter every five or six years our fiscal year includes an extra or 53 rd  week in the fourth quarter fiscal 2012 fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2014 each consisted of 52 weeks 

description of the business 

domino’s is the second largest pizza restaurant chain in the world with more than 11600 locations in over 75 markets founded in 1960 our roots are in convenient pizza delivery while a significant amount of our sales also come from carryout customers although we are a highlyrecognized global brand we focus on serving the local neighborhoods in which we live and do business through our large network of franchise owners and companyowned stores on average we sell more than 15 million pizzas each day throughout our global system 

our business model is straightforward we handcraft and serve quality food at a competitive price with easy ordering access and efficient service which are enhanced by our technology innovations our dough is generally made fresh and distributed to stores around the world by us and our franchisees 

domino’s generates revenues and earnings by charging royalties to its franchisees royalties are ongoing percentofsales fees for use of the domino’s brand marks the company also generates revenues and earnings by selling food equipment and supplies to franchisees primarily in the us and canada and by operating a number of our own stores franchisees profit by selling pizza and other complementary items to their local customers in our international markets we generally grant geographical rights to the domino’s pizza ® brand to master franchisees these master franchisees are charged with developing their geographical area and they profit by subfranchising and selling ingredients and equipment to those subfranchisees as well as by running pizza stores everyone in the system can benefit including the end consumer who can feed their family domino’s menu items conveniently and economically 

our business model can yield strong returns for our franchise owners and companyowned stores it can also yield significant cash flow to us through a consistent franchise royalty payment and supply chain revenue stream with moderate capital expenditures we have historically returned cash to shareholders through dividend payments and share buybacks since becoming a publiclytraded company 

in the fourth quarter of 2014 several organizational changes were made within the company’s management structure with one of the changes impacting the management of our supply chain operations as a result management determined that our previous domestic supply chain segment and the international supply chain operations division of our previous international segment should be combined into a new global supply chain segment as a result we now report the following three business segments domestic stores supply chain and international franchise while the consolidated results of the company have not been impacted by this change in our reportable segments we have restated our historical segment information in order to provide readers of our financial statements with a consistent presentation 

fiscal 2014 highlights 

 

  

  

  

  

 during 2014 we continued our rapid global expansion with the opening of 743 net new stores our international segment led the way with a record 662 net new store openings 

we continued our focus on growing online ordering and the digital customer experience as we introduced “dom” a voice ordering application which we believe is the first in the restaurant industry and we also made the domino’s tracker® available on the pebble smartwatch platform our emphasis on technology innovation helped us generate approximately 45 of us sales from digital channels in 2014 as well as reach an estimated 36 billion in global digital sales 

overall we believe our focus in 2014 on global growth and technology will strengthen our brand in the future 

  

fiscal 2013 highlights 

 

  

  

  

  

 during 2013 we continued our strong global growth as evidenced by the 631 net new stores that were opened our international segment led the way with 573 net new store openings 

we also remained focused on technology and improving the experience for our customers we launched our enhanced online ordering profiles platform allowing customers the ability to reorder their favorite order in as few as five clicks or about 30 seconds our emphasis on technology innovation helped us generate approximately 40 of us sales from digital channels in 2013 as well as reach an estimated 3 billion in global digital sales 

we believe our accomplishments and efforts in each of these areas will improve our brand image and brand positioning in the future 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america the preparation of these financial statements requires our management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis our management evaluates its estimates including those related to revenue recognition longlived and intangible assets insurance and legal matters sharebased payments and income taxes we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from those estimates changes in our accounting policies and estimates could materially impact our results of operations and financial condition for any particular period we believe that our most critical accounting policies and estimates are 

revenue recognition  we earn revenues through our network of domestic companyowned and franchised stores dough manufacturing and supply chain centers and international operations retail sales from franchise stores are reported to the company by its franchisees and are not included in company revenues retail sales from companyowned stores and royalty revenues resulting from the retail sales from franchised stores are recognized as revenues when the items are delivered to or carried out by customers retail sales are generally reported and related royalties paid to the company based on a percentage of retail sales as specified in the related standard franchise agreement generally 55 of domestic franchise retail sales and on average 31 of international franchise retail sales revenues from companyowned stores and royalty revenues from franchised stores can fluctuate from timetotime as a result of store count changes this can occur when a companyowned store is sold to a franchisee if a companyowned store that generated 500000 in revenue in fiscal 2013 was sold to a franchisee in fiscal 2014 revenues from companyowned stores would have declined by 500000 in fiscal 2014 while franchise royalty revenues would have increased by only 27500 in fiscal 2014 as we generally collect 55 of a domestic franchisee’s retail sales sales of food from our supply chain centers are recognized as revenues upon delivery of the food to franchisees while sales of equipment and supplies are generally recognized as revenues upon shipment of the related products to franchisees 

longlived and intangible assets we record longlived assets including property plant and equipment and capitalized software at cost for acquisitions of franchise operations we estimate the fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired based on physical inspection of assets historical experience and other information available to us regarding the acquisition we depreciate and amortize longlived assets using useful lives determined by us based on historical experience and other information available to us we evaluate the potential impairment of longlived assets at least annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable our evaluation is based on various analyses including the projection of undiscounted cash flows for companyowned stores we perform related impairment tests on an operating market basis which the company has determined to be the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of other cash flows if the carrying amount of a longlived asset exceeds the amount of the expected future undiscounted cash flows of that asset the company estimates the fair value of the asset if the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset an impairment loss is recognized and the asset is written down to its estimated fair value 

  

we have not made any significant changes in the methodology used to project the future market cash flows of companyowned stores during the years presented same store sales fluctuations and the rates at which operating costs will fluctuate in the future are key factors in evaluating recoverability of the related assets if our same store sales significantly decline or if operating costs increase and we are unable to recover these costs the carrying value of our companyowned stores by market may be unrecoverable and we may be required to recognize an impairment charge as discussed in note 1 to our consolidated financial statements the company incurred an impairment charge related to its corporate airplane in the fourth quarter of 2014 aside from this impairment charge the company did not record an impairment charge during fiscal 2014 

a significant portion of our goodwill relates to acquisitions of domestic franchise stores and is included in our domestic stores segment specifically our companyowned stores division we evaluate goodwill annually for impairment by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit which is primarily determined using the present value of historical cash flows to its carrying value if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value goodwill would be impaired we have not made any significant changes in the methodology used to evaluate goodwill impairment during the years presented at december 28 2014 the fair value of our business operations with associated goodwill exceeded their recorded carrying value including the related goodwill if cash flows generated by our companyowned stores were to decline significantly in the future or there were negative revisions to the market multiple assumption we may be required to recognize a goodwill impairment charge however based on the latest impairment analysis we do not believe it is reasonably likely that there could be changes in assumptions that would trigger impairment 

insurance and legal matters we are a party to lawsuits and legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business management closely monitors these legal matters and estimates the probable costs for the resolution of such matters these estimates are primarily determined by consulting with both internal and external parties handling the matters and are based upon an analysis of potential results assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies while historically our actual losses have been materially consistent with our reserves legal judgments can be volatile and difficult to predict accordingly if our estimates relating to legal matters proved inaccurate for any reason we may be required to increase or decrease the related expense in future periods we had accruals for legal matters of approximately 43 million at december 28 2014 and 50 million at december 29 2013 

for certain periods prior to december 1998 and for periods after december 2001 we maintain insurance coverage for workers’ compensation general liability and owned and nonowned auto liability under insurance policies requiring payment of a deductible for each occurrence up to between 500000 and 30 million depending on the policy year and line of coverage the related insurance reserves are based on undiscounted independent actuarial estimates which are based on historical information along with assumptions about future events specifically various methods including analyses of historical trends and actuarial valuation methods are utilized to estimate the cost to settle reported claims and claims incurred but not yet reported the actuarial valuation methods develop estimates of the future ultimate claim costs based on the claims incurred as of the balance sheet date when estimating these liabilities several factors are considered including the severity duration and frequency of claims legal cost associated with claims healthcare trends and projected inflation 

our methodology for determining our exposure has remained consistent throughout the years presented management believes that the various assumptions developed and actuarial methods used to determine our selfinsurance reserves are reasonable and provide meaningful data that management uses to make its best estimate of our exposure to these risks while historically our actual losses have been materially consistent with our reserves changes in assumptions for such factors as medical costs and legal actions as well as changes in actual experience could cause our estimates to change in the near term which could result in an increase or decrease in the related expense in future periods a 10 change in our selfinsurance liability at december 28 2014 would have affected our income before provision for income taxes by approximately 41 million for fiscal 2014 we had accruals for insurance matters of approximately 414 million at december 28 2014 and 388 million at december 29 2013 

sharebased payments we recognize compensation expense related to our sharebased compensation arrangements over the requisite service period based on the grant date fair value of the awards the grant date fair value of each restricted stock and performancebased restricted stock award is equal to the market price of our stock on the date of grant the grant date fair value of each stock option award is estimated using a blackscholes option pricing model the pricing model requires assumptions including the expected life of the stock option the riskfree interest rate the expected dividend yield and expected volatility of our stock over the expected life which significantly impact the assumed fair value we are also required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and only recognize expense for those awards expected to vest we use historical data to determine these assumptions additionally our stock option restricted stock and performancebased restricted stock arrangements provide for accelerated vesting and the ability to exercise during the remainder of the tenyear stock option life upon the retirement of individuals holding the awards who have achieved specified service and age requirements 

  

management believes that the methods and various assumptions used to determine compensation expense related to these arrangements are reasonable but if the assumptions change significantly for future grants sharebased compensation expense will fluctuate in future years 

income taxes we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities and reserves for uncertain tax positions we measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using current enacted tax rates that will apply in the years in which we expect the temporary differences to be recovered or paid judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes related reserves and deferred tax assets and liabilities these include establishing a valuation allowance related to the ability to realize certain deferred tax assets if necessary on an ongoing basis management will assess whether it remains more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets will be realized the company had valuation allowances recorded for deferred tax assets of approximately 05 million as of december 28 2014 and approximately 09 million as of december 29 2013 our accounting for deferred tax assets represents our best estimate of future events our net deferred tax assets assume that we will generate sufficient taxable income in specific tax jurisdictions based on our estimates and assumptions changes in our current estimates due to unanticipated events could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

the amounts recorded on the balance sheet relating to uncertain tax positions consider the ultimate resolution of revenue agent reviews based on estimates and assumptions we believe we have appropriately accounted for our uncertain tax positions however tax audits changes in tax laws and other unforeseen matters may result in us owing additional taxes we adjust our reserves for uncertain tax positions when facts and circumstances change or due to the passage of time the completion of a tax audit the expiration of a statute of limitations or changes in penalty and interest reserves associated with uncertain tax positions are examples of situations when we may adjust our reserves management believes that our tax positions comply with applicable tax law and that we have adequately provided for these matters however to the extent the final tax outcome of these matters is different than our recorded amounts we may be required to adjust our tax reserves resulting in additional income tax expense or benefit in future periods

income statement data 

 

 2014 compared to 2013 

tabular amounts in millions except percentages 

revenues revenues primarily consist of retail sales from our companyowned stores royalties and fees from our domestic and international franchised stores and sales of food equipment and supplies from our supply chain centers to substantially all of our domestic franchised stores and certain international franchised stores companyowned store and franchised store revenues may vary from period to period due to changes in store count mix supply chain revenues may vary significantly as a result of fluctuations in commodity prices as well as the mix of products we sell 

consolidated revenues increased 1916 million or 106 in 2014 the increase was driven by higher supply chain revenues due to higher volumes from increased store order counts higher commodity prices and increased sales of equipment to stores in connection with our store reimaging program domestic store revenues rose due to an increase in same store sales and store count growth in addition higher international franchise same store sales and store count growth also increased consolidated revenues these increases were offset in part by the negative impact on international revenues of changes in foreign currency exchange rates these changes in revenues are more fully described below 

domestic stores revenues from domestic stores are primarily comprised of retail sales from domestic companyowned store operations as well as royalties from retail sales and other fees from domestic franchised stores as summarized in the following table 

 

 higher franchise same store sales store count growth and higher domestic companyowned same store sales drove an increase in overall domestic store revenues of 289 million or 53 these results are more fully described below 

domestic companyowned stores revenues from domestic companyowned store operations increased 111 million or 33 in 2014 this increase was due to a 62 increase in same store sales as compared to 2013 offset in part by a decrease in the average number of domestic companyowned stores open during 2014 

domestic franchise revenues from domestic franchise operations increased 178 million or 84 in 2014 the increase was driven by a 77 increase in same store sales as compared to 2013 and to a lesser extent an increase in the average number of domestic franchised stores open during 2014 revenues further benefited from fees paid by franchisees related to our insourced online ordering platform and we also incurred an increase in expenses related to these technology initiatives 

  

supply chain revenues from supply chain operations are primarily comprised of sales of food equipment and supplies from our supply chain centers to substantially all of our domestic franchised stores and certain international franchised stores as summarized in the following table 

 

 domestic supply chain domestic supply chain revenues increased 1312 million or 130 in 2014 the increase was primarily attributable to higher volumes from increased order counts at the store level higher overall commodity prices and increases in sales of equipment and supplies changes in us cheese prices increased revenues by approximately 330 million in 2014 

international supply chain revenues from international supply chain operations increased 124 million or 113 in 2014 this increase resulted primarily from higher volumes in 2014 and was offset in part by the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates of approximately 73 million during the year 

international franchise international franchise revenues primarily consist of royalties from retail sales and other fees from our international franchise stores revenues from international franchise operations increased 190 million or 143 in 2014 this increase was due to higher same store sales and an increase in the average number of international stores open during 2014 and was offset in part by the negative impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates of approximately 34 million in 2014 excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rates same store sales increased 69 in 2014 compared to 2013 when the impact of foreign currency exchange rates is included same store sales increased 49 in 2014 compared to 2013 this variance was caused by a generally stronger us dollar when compared to the currencies in the international markets in which we compete 

cost of sales  operating margin consolidated cost of sales consists primarily of domestic companyowned store and supply chain costs incurred to generate related revenues components of consolidated cost of sales primarily include food labor and occupancy costs the changes to the consolidated operating margin which we define as revenues less cost of sales are summarized in the following table 

 

 the 458 million or 83 increase in consolidated operating margin was due primarily to higher domestic and international franchise revenues and higher supply chain margins franchise revenues do not have a cost of sales component so changes in franchise revenues have a disproportionate effect on the consolidated operating margin 

as a percentage of total revenues our consolidated operating margin decreased 07 percentage points in 2014 due to lower supply chain and companyowned stores operating margins as a percentage of their revenues these changes were primarily a result of higher commodity prices and were offset in part by a higher mix of franchise revenues and are more fully described below 

domestic companyowned stores the changes to domestic companyowned store operating margin which do not include other storelevel costs such as royalties and advertising are summarized in the following table 

 

 the 03 million or 04 increase in the domestic companyowned store operating margin was due primarily to higher same store sales this was offset in part by an increase in overall commodity prices and labor and related expenses 

as a percentage of store revenues the store operating margin decreased 07 percentage points in 2014 as discussed in more detail below 

 

  

  

  

   

supply chain the changes to the supply chain operating margin are summarized in the following table 

 

 the 86 million increase in the supply chain operating margin was due primarily to higher volumes from increased store order counts 

as a percentage of supply chain revenues the supply chain operating margin decreased 05 percentage points in 2014 due to higher commodity prices and higher health insurance costs offset in part by the positive impact of higher volumes increases in certain food prices have a negative effect on the supply chain operating margin percentage due to the fixed dollar margin earned by supply chain on certain food items changes in us cheese prices increased both revenues and costs by 330 million in 2014 if the 2014 us cheese prices had been in effect during 2013 the supply chain operating margin as a percentage of supply chain revenues would have decreased by 03 percentage points however the dollar margin would have been unaffected 

general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses increased 142 million or 61 in 2014 these increases were due in part to an impairment charge of 58 million in connection with replacing our corporate airplane as well as continued investments that we made in technology and international initiatives including the addition of team members in both areas a decrease in noncash compensation expense of 44 million partially offset these increases 

interest income interest income decreased slightly to 01 million in 2014 

interest expense interest expense decreased 20 million to 869 million in 2014 the decrease was due primarily to lower interest expense resulting from a lower average debt balance during 2014 compared to 2013 and to a lesser extent lower interest expense from the cash collateralization of our letters of credit 

our cash borrowing rate remained flat at 53 during fiscal 2014 our average outstanding debt balance excluding capital lease obligations was approximately 152 billion in 2014 and approximately 154 billion in 2013 the decrease in the company’s average outstanding debt balance resulted from the principal payments made on its fixed rate notes during the first two quarters of 2014 

provision for income taxes provision for income taxes increased 139 million to 960 million in 2014 due primarily to higher pretax income the company’s effective income tax rate increased 06 percentage points to 371 of pretax income in 2014 the lower effective tax rate in fiscal 2013 primarily resulted from a tax benefit recorded for prior tax years in connection with the company revising its calculation for a deduction related to its domestic dough production 

2013 compared to 2012 

tabular amounts in millions except percentages 

revenues consolidated revenues increased 1238 million or 74 in 2013 the increase was driven by higher supply chain revenues due to a change in the mix of products sold higher volumes from increased store order counts and higher commodity prices higher international same store sales and store count growth also increased consolidated revenues domestic franchise and companyowned store revenues also rose due to an increase in same store sales these increases were offset in part by the negative impact on international revenues of changes in foreign currency exchange rates these changes in revenues are more fully described below 

domestic stores domestic stores revenues are summarized in the following table 

 

 higher franchise same store sales and higher domestic companyowned same store sales drove an increase in royalty revenues which increased overall domestic store revenues by 311 million or 60 these results are more fully described below 

domestic companyowned stores revenues from domestic companyowned store operations increased 138 million or 43 in 2013 the increase was primarily due to a 39 increase in same store sales as compared to 2012 

  

domestic franchise revenues from domestic franchise operations increased 174 million or 89 in 2013 the increase was driven by a 55 increase in same store sales as compared to 2012 and to a lesser extent an increase in the average number of domestic franchised stores open during 2013 revenues further benefited from fees paid by franchisees related to our insourced online ordering platform and we also incurred an increase in expenses related to these technology initiatives additionally we contracted with a third party to manage our gift card program during 2013 in connection with this change we refined our assessment of our gift card liability and recorded approximately 32 million of domestic franchise revenue and reimbursed approximately 15 million to our national advertising fund as discussed further in general and administrative expenses 

supply chain supply chain revenues are summarized in the following table 

 

 domestic supply chain domestic supply chain revenues increased 677 million or 72 in 2013 the increase was primarily attributable to higher volumes from increased order counts at the store level higher overall commodity prices a change in the mix of products sold and increases in sales of equipment and supplies changes in us cheese prices increased revenues by approximately 86 million in 2013 

international supply chain revenues from international supply chain operations increased 114 million or 117 in 2013 the increase resulted primarily from higher volumes during the year and was offset in part by the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates of 29 million in 2013 

international franchise international franchise revenues increased 136 million or 113 in 2013 the increase was primarily driven by higher same store sales and an increase in the average number of international stores open during 2013 offset in part by the negative impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates of approximately 43 million in 2013 excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rates same store sales increased 62 in 2013 compared to 2012 when the impact of foreign currency exchange rates is included same store sales increased 28 in 2013 compared to 2012 this variance was caused by a generally stronger us dollar when compared to the currencies in the international markets in which we compete 

cost of sales  operating margin the changes to the consolidated operating margin which we define as revenues less cost of sales are summarized in the following table 

 

 the 477 million or 95 increase in consolidated operating margin was due primarily to higher domestic and international franchise revenues higher margins at our companyowned stores and higher domestic supply chain margins franchise revenues do not have a cost of sales component so changes in franchise revenues have a disproportionate effect on the consolidated operating margin 

as a percentage of total revenues our consolidated operating margin increased 06 percentage points in 2013 due to a higher mix of franchise revenues and higher supply chain and companyowned stores operating margins offset in part by higher overall commodity prices 

domestic companyowned stores the changes to domestic companyowned store operating margin which do not include other storelevel costs such as royalties and advertising are summarized in the following table 

 

 the 45 million or 60 increase in the domestic companyowned store operating margin was the result of higher same store sales lower labor and related expenses lower occupancy expenses and lower insurance expenses this was offset in part by an increase in overall commodity prices 

  

as a percentage of store revenues the store operating margin increased 04 percentage points in 2013 as discussed in more detail below 

 

  

  

  

 supply chain the changes to the supply chain operating margin are summarized in the following table 

 

 the supply chain operating margin increased 121 million or 110 in 2013 due primarily to higher volumes from increased store order counts and a change in the mix of products sold 

as a percentage of supply chain revenues the supply chain operating margin increased 03 percentage points in 2013 due to the positive impact of higher volumes and lower health insurance costs offset in part by higher commodity costs increases in certain food prices have a negative effect on the supply chain operating margin percentage due to the fixed dollar margin earned by supply chain on certain food items changes in us cheese prices increased both revenues and costs by 86 million in 2013 if the 2013 us cheese prices had been in effect during 2012 the supply chain operating margin as a percentage of supply chain revenues would have decreased by 01 percentage points however the dollar margin would have been unaffected 

general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses increased 162 million or 74 in 2013 these increases were due in part to an increase in noncash compensation expense of 44 million and higher variable performancebased compensation expenses of approximately 20 million general and administrative expenses also include a reimbursement of approximately 15 million during 2013 to our national advertising fund related to their historical costs to support the company’s gift card program as discussed above in domestic franchise revenues additionally we continued our investments in technology and international initiatives including the addition of team members in both areas which also increased general and administrative expenses during 2013 compared to 2012 

interest income interest income decreased slightly to 02 million in 2013 

interest expense interest expense decreased 126 million to 889 million in 2013 the decrease was driven by approximately 102 million of expenses incurred in the first quarter of 2012 related to the 2012 recapitalization which did not recur in 2013 as well as from lower interest expense resulting from a lower average debt balance during 2013 compared to 2012 

our cash borrowing rate decreased slightly by 02 percentage points to 53 during fiscal 2013 our average outstanding debt balance excluding capital lease obligations was approximately 15 billion in 2013 and approximately 16 billion in 2012 the decrease in the company’s average outstanding debt balance resulted from the principal payments made on its fixed rate notes during 2013 

provision for income taxes provision for income taxes increased 133 million in 2013 due primarily to higher pretax income the company’s 2013 effective income tax rate decreased 15 percentage points to 365 of pretax income this decrease was partly from a tax benefit of approximately 14 million recorded in the third quarter of 2013 related to prior tax years in connection with the company revising its calculation for a deduction related to its domestic dough production 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

historically we have operated with minimal positive working capital or negative working capital primarily because our receivable collection periods and inventory turn rates are faster than the normal payment terms on our current liabilities we generally collect our receivables within three weeks from the date of the related sale and we generally experience 30 to 40 inventory turns per year in addition our sales are not typically seasonal which further limits our working capital requirements these factors coupled with the use of our ongoing cash flows from operations to service our debt obligations invest in our business pay dividends and repurchase our common stock reduce our working capital amounts as of december 28 2014 we had working capital of 418 million excluding restricted cash and cash equivalents of 1210 million and including total unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of 309 million 

as of december 28 2014 we had approximately 562 million of restricted cash held for future principal and interest payments 439 million of cash held as collateral for outstanding letters of credit 208 million of restricted cash held in a three month interest reserve as required by the related debt agreements and 01 million of other restricted cash for a total of 1210 million of restricted cash and cash equivalents 

the company entered into a recapitalization transaction in 2012 in which certain of our subsidiaries replaced the outstanding 2007 fixed rate notes and variable funding notes with new notes the notes issued pursuant to an assetbacked securitization the notes consist of 1575 billion of series 20121 5216 fixed rate senior secured notes class a2 the fixed rate notes and 1000 million of series 20121 variable funding senior secured notes class a1 the variable funding notes additional information related to the recapitalization transaction is included in note 4 to our consolidated financial statements 

the fixed rate notes original scheduled principal amortization payments are 295 million in 2015 374 million in 2016 394 million in each of 2017 and 2018 and 98 million in 2019 in accordance with our debt agreements once we meet certain conditions including maximum leverage ratios as defined of less than or equal to 45x total debt to ebitda we cease to make the scheduled principal amortization payments if one of the defined leverage ratios subsequently exceeds 45x we must makeup the payments we had previously not made during the second quarter of 2014 we met the maximum leverage ratios of less than 45x and in accordance with our debt agreements ceased debt amortization payments in the third quarter of 2014 we continued to meet the maximum leverage ratios of less than 45x in the third and fourth quarters of 2014 and currently do not plan to make previously scheduled debt amortization payments as permitted in our debt agreements 

the notes are subject to certain financial and nonfinancial covenants including a debt service coverage calculation as defined in the related agreements in the event that certain covenants are not met the notes may become due and payable on an accelerated schedule 

on march 16 2012 our board of directors declared a 300 per share special cash dividend on the outstanding common stock totaling 1711 million which was paid on april 2 2012 to stockholders of record at the close of business on march 26 2012 additionally under the antidilution provisions in our underlying stock option plans on april 2 2012 we made a corresponding cash payment of approximately 135 million on certain stock options reduced the exercise price on certain other stock options by an equivalent per share amount and in certain circumstances both reduced the stock option exercise price and made a cash payment totaling 300 per share 

on april 2 2012 we also accrued an estimated 24 million for payments to be made as certain performancebased restricted stock grants vest the dividend and related dividend equivalent payments were funded with the remaining proceeds from the 2012 recapitalization and cash on hand these antidilution payments were accounted for as modificationssettlements and were recorded as increases in total stockholders’ deficit as of december 30 2012 total cash paid for common stock dividends and related antidilution equivalent payments was approximately 1855 million and the total estimated liability recorded for future cash dividend payments on certain performancebased restricted stock was approximately 15 million as of december 28 2014 the total estimated liability recorded for future cash dividend payments on certain performancebased restricted stock was approximately 06 million 

during fiscal 2012 in connection with the 2012 recapitalization we incurred approximately 105 million of net expenses additionally we recorded an additional 325 million of deferred financing costs as an asset in the consolidated balance sheet during fiscal 2012 this amount in addition to the 74 million recorded on the consolidated balance sheet at january 1 2012 is being amortized into interest expense over the sevenyear expected term of the debt 

  

our primary source of liquidity is cash flows from operations and availability of borrowings under our variable funding notes as of december 28 2014 we had 441 million of outstanding letters of credit and 559 million of available borrowing capacity under our variable funding notes the letters of credit are primarily related to our casualty insurance programs and supply chain center leases the company has collateralized these letters of credit with 439 million of restricted cash to reduce its fees on the variable funding notes and has the ability to access this cash with minimal notice borrowings under the variable funding notes are available to fund our working capital requirements capital expenditures and subject to other limitations other general corporate purposes including dividend payments 

the company has a board of directorsapproved open market share repurchase program of the company’s common stock which was reset during the first quarter of 2014 at 2000 million the open market share repurchase program has historically been funded by excess cash flows the company used cash of approximately 824 million in 2014 and 971 million in 2013 for share repurchases the company had approximately 1327 million left under the 2000 million authorization as of december 28 2014 we expect to continue to use ongoing excess cash flow generation and subject to certain restrictions in the documents governing the variable funding notes availability under the variable funding notes to among other things repurchase shares under the current authorized program 

in the past three years we have invested between 293 million and 718 million annually in capital expenditures in 2014 we invested 718 million in capital expenditures which primarily related to investments in existing companyowned stores supply chain centers and training facilities the purchase of a corporate airplane investments in our proprietary internally developed pointofsale system domino’s pulse our digital ordering platform and other technology initiatives we expect to continue capital expenditures of 50 to 60 million in the future as we see continuing opportunities to invest in our industry leading technology platform the reimaging of our corporate stores and other initiatives to grow our brand we did not have any material commitments for capital expenditures as of december 28 2014 

the following table illustrates the main components of our cash flows 

 

 operating activities 

cash provided by operating activities was 1923 million in fiscal 2014 our cash provided by operating activities was mainly the result of net income of 1626 million that was generated during the year which included noncash expenses of 297 million 

during fiscal 2013 cash provided by operating activities was 1940 million mainly the result of net income of 1430 generated during fiscal 2013 and which included noncash expenses of 395 million the changes in operating assets and liabilities also generated 115 million of cash inflows during 2013 

cash provided by operating activities was 1763 million in fiscal 2012 our cash provided by operating activities was mainly the result of net income of 1124 million that was generated during the year and which included 438 million of noncash expenses the changes in operating assets and liabilities also generated 201 million of cash inflows primarily from the timing of payments of operating liabilities 

we are focused on continually improving our net income and cash flow from operations and management expects to continue to generate positive cash flows from operating activities for the foreseeable future 

investing activities 

during fiscal 2014 cash used in investing activities was 574 million which consisted primarily of 701 million of capital expenditures driven by increased investments in companyowned stores and supply chain centers investments in our technology initiatives and the purchase of a corporate airplane proceeds from the sale of assets of 92 million and a 45 million net change in restricted cash offset the use of cash in investing activities 

  

during fiscal 2013 cash used in investing activities was 997 million which consisted primarily of a 654 million net change in restricted cash and cash equivalents and 404 million of capital expenditures offset by 45 million of proceeds from the sale of assets 

cash provided by investing activities was 73 million in fiscal 2012 the main drivers of this change were the net change in restricted cash that provided 326 million of cash and the use of cash through 293 million of capital expenditures 

financing activities 

we used 1189 million of cash in financing activities in fiscal 2014 compared to 1348 million during fiscal 2013 both primarily related to purchases of common stock funding dividend payments to our shareholders and making payments on our longterm debt obligations the tax impact of equitybased compensation offset the use of cash in financing activities in both fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2013 

in fiscal 2012 we used 1774 million of cash in financing activities during fiscal 2012 we issued 16 billion of debt in connection with our 2012 recapitalization which was more than offset by the 15 billion repayment of our existing debt at that time the payment of 1855 million of special dividend payments to our shareholders 882 million purchases of common stock and 325 million of cash paid for financing costs related to our 2012 recapitalization 

during fiscal 2014 we experienced increases in both domestic and international same store sales and our international business continued to grow stores these factors have contributed to our continued ability to generate positive operating cash flows we expect to use our unrestricted cash and cash equivalents our restricted cash amounts pledged as collateral for letters of credit ongoing cash flows from operations and available borrowings under the variable funding notes to among other things fund working capital requirements invest in our core business pay dividends and repurchase our common stock based upon the current level of operations and anticipated growth we believe that the cash generated from operations our current unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and amounts available under the variable funding notes will be more than adequate to meet our anticipated debt service requirements capital expenditures dividend payments and working capital needs for the foreseeable future 

our ability to continue to fund these items and continue to reduce debt could be adversely affected by the occurrence of any of the events described in item 1a risk factors there can be no assurance however that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operations or that future borrowings will be available under the variable funding notes or otherwise to enable us to service our indebtedness or to make anticipated capital expenditures our future operating performance and our ability to service extend or refinance the fixed rate notes and to service extend or refinance the variable funding notes will be subject to future economic conditions and to financial business and other factors many of which are beyond our control 

impact of inflation 

we believe that our results of operations are not materially impacted by moderate changes in the inflation rate inflation did not have a material impact on our operations in 2014 2013 or 2012 severe increases in inflation however could affect the global and us economies and could have an adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations further discussion on the impact of commodities and other cost pressures is included above as well as in item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

new accounting pronouncements 

in may 2014 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued accounting standards update 201409 revenue from contracts with customers  this guidance outlines a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance issued by the fasb including industry specific guidance the guidance is effective for the company for interim and annual reporting periods beginning on january 1 2017 and permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method early adoption is prohibited the company is evaluating the effect that this guidance will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures 

accounting standards that have been issued by the fasb or other standardssetting bodies that do not require adoption until a future date are not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements upon adoption 

  

contractual obligations 

the following is a summary of our significant contractual obligations at december 28 2014 

 

  

    liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits of 29 million are excluded from the above table as we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period of payment for additional information on unrecognized tax benefits see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we are party to letters of credit and to a lesser extent financial guarantees with offbalance sheet risk our exposure to credit loss for letters of credit and financial guarantees is represented by the contractual amounts of these instruments total conditional commitments under letters of credit as of december 28 2014 were approximately 441 million and relate to our insurance programs and supply chain center leases the company has guaranteed lease payments related to certain franchisees’ lease arrangements the maximum amount of potential future payments under these guarantees is 22 million as of december 28 2014 we believe that none of these arrangements has or is likely to have a material effect on our results of operations financial condition or liquidity

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk 

we do not engage in speculative transactions nor do we hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes in connection with the 2012 recapitalization we issued fixed rate notes and at december 28 2014 we are only exposed to interest rate risk on borrowings under our variable funding notes as of december 28 2014 we had no outstanding borrowings under our variable funding notes our fixed rate debt exposes the company to changes in market interest rates reflected in the fair value of the debt and to the risk that the company may need to refinance maturing debt with new debt at a higher rate 

we are exposed to market risks from changes in commodity prices during the normal course of business we purchase cheese and certain other food products that are affected by changes in commodity prices and as a result we are subject to volatility in our food costs we may periodically enter into financial instruments to manage this risk we do not engage in speculative transactions nor do we hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes in instances when we use fixed pricing agreements with our suppliers these agreements cover our physical commodity needs are not netsettled and are accounted for as normal purchases 

from time to time we have entered into interest rate swaps collars or similar instruments with the objective of managing volatility relating to our borrowing costs we had no outstanding derivative instruments as of december 28 2014 or december 29 2013 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

we have exposure to various foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations for revenues generated by our operations outside the united states which can adversely impact our net income and cash flows approximately 77 of our total revenues in 2014 74 of our total revenues in 2013 and 71 of our total revenues in 2012 were derived from our international franchise segment a majority of which were denominated in foreign currencies we also operate dough manufacturing and distribution facilities in canada which generate revenues denominated in canadian dollars we do not enter into financial instruments to manage this foreign currency exchange risk a hypothetical 10 adverse change in the foreign currency rates for our international markets would have resulted in a negative impact on royalty revenues of approximately 147 million in 2014

 item 1 business tableend overview 

domino’s pizza inc referred to as the “company” “domino’s” or in the first person notations of “we” “us” and “our” is the number one pizza delivery company in the united states based on reported consumer spending we also have a leading international presence ranking as the second largest pizza company in the world based on number of units and retail sales on average over 15 million pizzas are sold each day throughout the domino’s global system with deliveries covering approximately 15 million miles per week we pioneered the pizza delivery business and have built the domino’s pizza ® brand into one of the most widelyrecognized consumer brands in the world together with our domestic franchisees we have supported the domino’s pizza ® brand with an estimated 14 billion in advertising spending in the united states over the past five years additionally our international franchisees invest significant amounts in advertising efforts in their markets we operate through a network of 10886 companyowned and franchise stores located in all 50 states and in more than 70 international markets in addition we operate 16 regional dough manufacturing and supply chain centers one equipment and supply facility one thin crust manufacturing center and one vegetable processing center in the contiguous united states and seven dough manufacturing and supply chain centers outside the contiguous united states the foundation of our systemwide success and leading market position is our strong relationships with our franchisees comprised of nearly 2500 owneroperators throughout the world dedicated to the success of the domino’s pizza ® brand 

over our 53year history we have developed a simple business model focused on our core strength of delivering quality pizza and other complementary items in a timely manner this business model includes a delivery and carryout oriented store design with relatively low capital requirements when compared to certain other restaurant concepts a focused menu of pizza and other complementary items committed owneroperator franchisees and a verticallyintegrated supply chain system in the us our earnings are driven largely by retail sales at our franchise stores which generate royalty payments and in the us and canada supply chain revenues to us we also generate earnings through retail sales at our companyowned stores internationally most geographies are granted to a qualified master franchisee and this master franchisee can utilize three potential income streams owning and operating stores subfranchising stores and owning and operating supply chain centers 

we operate our business in three segments domestic stores domestic supply chain and international 

 

  

  

 on a consolidated basis we generated revenues of over 180 billion and income from operations after deducting 716 million of unallocated corporate and other expenses of 3138 million in 2013 net income was 1430 million in 2013 in each of the past three years we have been able to increase our net income grow our global retail sales and in those three years we have added over 1500 stores worldwide we were able to grow our business with capital expenditures that ranged between 243 million to 404 million per year as a significant portion of our earnings are derived from retail sales by our franchisees who are responsible for their own capital expenditures 

our history 

we have been delivering quality affordable pizza to our customers since 1960 when brothers thomas and james monaghan borrowed 900 and purchased a small pizza store in ypsilanti michigan since that time our store count and geographic reach have grown substantially we opened our first franchise store in 1967 and our first international store in 1983 during 2012 we opened our 10000 th store worldwide and as of december 29 2013 we had 10886 stores worldwide 

 

in 1998 an investor group led by investment funds associated with bain capital llc completed a recapitalization through which the investor group acquired a 93 controlling economic interest in our company from founder thomas monaghan and his family in 2004 domino’s pizza inc completed its initial public offering the “ipo” and now trades on the new york stock exchange under the ticker symbol “dpz” in connection with the ipo on may 11 2004 we reincorporated in delaware currently there are no shares held by our founder or in the original investment funds associated with bain capital llc 

during 2012 the company completed a recapitalization transaction the “2012 recapitalization” primarily consisting of i the issuance of 1575 billion of borrowings of fixed rate notes ii the purchase and retirement of all outstanding 2007 fixed rate notes the “2007 notes” iii the replacement of its existing variable funding note facility with a new 1000 million facility and iv the payment of a special cash dividend to shareholders and related antidilution payments and adjustments to certain stock option holders 

industry overview 

in this document we rely on and refer to information regarding the us quick service restaurant or qsr sector the us qsr pizza category and its components and competitors including us from the crest ® report prepared by the npd group as well as market research reports analyst reports and other publiclyavailable information although we believe this information to be reliable we have not independently verified it domestic sales information relating to the qsr sector us qsr pizza category and us pizza delivery and carryout represent reported consumer spending obtained by the npd group’s crest ® report from consumer surveys this information relates to both our companyowned and franchise stores unless otherwise indicated all us industry data included in this document is based on reported consumer spending obtained by the npd group’s crest ® report from consumer surveys 

the us qsr pizza category is large and fragmented from 2003 to 2013 the us qsr pizza category in which domino’s pizza competes has grown from 305 billion to 325 billion with sales of 325 billion in the twelve months ended november 2013 it is the third largest category within the 2542 billion us qsr sector the us qsr pizza category is primarily comprised of delivery dinein and carryout 

we participate primarily in two segments of this industry the delivery and carryout segments during the period from 2003 to 2013 the delivery segment declined from 111 billion to 96 billion including decreasing slightly over the past three years from 98 billion in 2011 to 96 billion in 2013 its 96 billion of sales accounted for approximately 30 of total us qsr pizza category sales in the twelve months ended november 2013 we and our top two competitors account for approximately 53 of us pizza delivery based on reported consumer spending with the remaining 47 attributable to regional chains and individual establishments from 2003 to 2013 the carryout segment grew from 121 billion to 146 billion additionally in the past three years the carryout segment grew from 143 billion in 2011 to 146 billion in 2013 we are the market share leader in the delivery segment and the second largest in the carryout segment where we have been focused on growing our market share given our strong brand convenient store locations and quality affordable menu offerings 

in contrast to the united states international pizza delivery is relatively underdeveloped with only domino’s and two other competitors having a significant global presence we believe that demand for international pizza and pizza delivery is large and growing driven by international consumers’ increasing emphasis on convenience and the proven success of our 30 years of conducting business abroad 

our competitive strengths 

we believe that our competitive strengths include the following 

 

  

  

 in addition we generally share 50 or a higher percentage in the case of companyowned stores and certain franchisees who operate a larger number of stores of the pretax profits generated by our regional dough manufacturing and supply chain centers with those domestic franchisees who agree to purchase all of their food from our supply chain system these arrangements strengthen our ties with our franchisees by enhancing their profitability while providing us with a continuing source of revenues and earnings this arrangement also provides incentives for franchisees to work closely with us to reduce costs we believe our strong mutuallybeneficial franchisee relationships are evidenced by the over 99 voluntary participation in our domestic supply chain system our approximately 99 domestic franchise contract renewal rate and our over 99 collection rate on domestic franchise royalty and domestic supply chain receivables 

internationally we have been able to grow our franchise network by attracting franchisees with business experience capital and local market knowledge we generally employ our master franchise model which provides our international franchisees with exclusive rights to operate stores and subfranchise our wellrecognized domino’s pizza ® brand name in specific agreedupon market areas as well as operate their own supply chain systems from yearend 2008 through 2013 we grew our international franchise network 58 from 3726 stores to 5900 stores our largest master franchisee domino’s pizza enterprises limited operates 1270 stores in six markets which accounts for approximately 22 of our total international store count and approximately 12 of our global store count during 2013 we had 573 net international store openings including 125 net stores in india 76 net stores in turkey 51 net stores in the united kingdom 42 net stores in japan and 41 net stores in australia 

 

 we believe that our store economics have led to a strong welldiversified franchise system this established franchise system has produced strong cash flow and earnings for us which has enabled us to invest in the domino’s pizza ® brand our stores our technology and our supply chain centers pay significant dividends repurchase and retire shares of our common stock and repurchase and retire outstanding principal on our fixed rate notes 

 

  

outside the united states we have significant market share positions in the key markets in which we compete including the united kingdom india mexico australia south korea canada turkey japan france and the netherlands these top ten international markets based on store count accounted for approximately 79 of our international retail sales in 2013 we believe we have a strong presence in each of these markets 

 

 we believe that our brand is particularly strong among pizza consumers for whom a meal is a fairly spontaneous event in these situations we believe that service and product quality are the consumers’ priorities we believe that well established demographic and lifestyle trends will drive continuing emphasis on convenience and will therefore continue to play into our brand’s strength 

 

 in 2013 we made approximately 523000 fullservice food deliveries to our domestic stores or approximately two deliveries per store per week with a fill rate of over 99 fill rate is an industry metric which compares the number of items delivered to the number of items ordered all of our companyowned stores and over 99 of our domestic franchise stores purchase all of their food and supplies from us this is accomplished through our network of 16 regional dough manufacturing and supply chain centers each of which is generally located within a oneday delivery radius of the stores it serves and a leased fleet of over 400 tractors and trailers additionally we supply certain of our domestic and international franchisees with equipment and supplies through our equipment and supply center which we operate as part of our domestic supply chain segment offering a full range of nonfood products from ovens to uniforms we also supply certain of our domestic stores with ingredients that are processed at our vegetable processing center and thin crust product that is manufactured at our thin crust manufacturing center both of which we operate as part of our domestic supply chain segment 

because we source the food for substantially all of our domestic stores our domestic supply chain segment enables us to leverage and monitor our strong supplier relationships to achieve the cost benefits of scale and to ensure compliance with our rigorous quality standards in addition the “onestop shop” nature of this system combined with our delivery accuracy allows store managers to eliminate a significant component of the typical “backofstore” activity that many of our competitors’ store managers must undertake additionally we operate seven supply chain centers that service certain of our international franchise markets 

our business strategy 

we intend to achieve further growth and strengthen our competitive position through the continued implementation of our business strategy which includes the following key elements 

 

  

  

  

  

  

we adhere to the following guiding principles which are based on the concept of one united brand system and team 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 the carryout component had 146 billion of sales in the twelve months ended november 2013 while our primary focus is on pizza delivery we are also favorably positioned as a leader in the growing carryout component given our strong brand store locations and quality affordable menu offerings 

 

 our domestic stores have historically contributed 4 or 5 of their retail sales to fund national marketing and advertising campaigns with additional required contributions to local marketlevel programs beginning in 2010 all domestic franchisees contributed 55 subject in limited instances to lower rates based on certain incentives and waivers of their retail sales for national advertising in january 2013 with the support of the domestic franchise system domestic franchisees amended their standard franchise agreements to require a contribution of 6 subject in limited instances to lower rates based on certain incentives and waivers of their retail sales for national advertising we currently anticipate that this 6 contribution rate which took effect in 2013 will remain in place for the foreseeable future 

 

 we believe that pizza has global appeal and that there is strong and growing international demand for delivered pizza we have successfully built a broad international platform primarily through our master franchise model as evidenced by our 5900 international stores in more than 70 international markets we believe that we continue to have significant longterm growth opportunities in international markets where we have established a leading presence in our top ten international markets we believe that our current store base is approximately half of the total longterm potential store base in those markets 

generally we believe we will achieve longterm growth internationally as a result of the favorable storelevel economics of our business model the growing international demand for pizza and delivered pizza and the strong global recognition of the domino’s pizza ® brand our international stores have produced positive quarterly same store sales growth for 80 consecutive quarters additionally during 2013 we had 573 net international store openings including 125 net stores in india 76 net stores in turkey 51 net stores in the united kingdom 42 net stores in japan and 41 net stores in australia 

 

 we continue to introduce innovative consumertested and profitable new product varieties as another important way to bring compelling news and product innovation to our customers products such as handmade pan pizzas oven baked sandwiches and domino’s american legends ® have been added to our product lineup since 2008 along with complementary side items such as our parmesan bread bites stuffed cheesy bread and chocolate lava crunch cakes we believe this focus on innovation when coupled with our scale and share leadership will allow us to grow our position in both us pizza delivery and carryout 

store operations 

we believe that our focused and proven store model provides a significant competitive advantage relative to many of our competitors who focus on multiple components of the pizza category particularly dinein we have been focused primarily on pizza delivery for over 50 years during 2012 we introduced our new pizza theater store design which may offer casual seating for customers to watch the preparation of their orders but does not offer a fullservice dinein area certain of our international stores also offer casual seating but generally do not offer fullservice dinein areas as a result our domestic and international stores do not require expensive restaurant facilities and staffing our stores also benefit from lower maintenance costs as store assets have long lives and updates are not frequently required our simple and efficient operational processes which we have refined through continuous improvement include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 strategic store locations to facilitate delivery and carryout service 

we locate our stores strategically to facilitate timely delivery and carryout service to our customers the majority of our domestic stores are located in populated areas in or adjacent to large or midsize cities or on or near college campuses we use geographic information software which incorporates variables such as household demographics competitor locations traffic volumes and visibility to evaluate and identify potential store locations and new markets 

productionoriented store designs 

our typical store is relatively small occupying on average approximately 1500 square feet and is designed with a focus on efficient and timely production of consistently high quality food for delivery and carryout the store layout has been refined over time to provide an efficient flow from ordertaking to delivery or carryout although our new pizza theater store design may offer a small casual dining area our stores do not offer a fullservice dinein area 

 

product and process innovations 

our over 50 years of experience and innovative culture have resulted in numerous new product and process developments that increase both quality and efficiency these include our efficient verticallyintegrated supply chain system a sturdier corrugated pizza box and a mesh screen that helped cook pizza crust more evenly the domino’s heatwave ® hot bag keeps our pizzas hot during delivery we also continue to introduce new products such as domino’s american legends ® pizzas launched in 2009 stuffed cheesy bread launched in 2011 and parmesan bread bites and our new handmade pan pizzas both launched in 2012 additionally we have added a number of complementary side items to our menu such as cinna stix ® and chocolate lava crunch cakes in 2009 we introduced our improved pizza recipe which was a change to our core pizza recipe 

focused menu 

we maintain a focused menu that is designed to present an attractive quality offering to customers while minimizing order errors and expediting the order taking and food preparation processes our basic menu has three choices for pizza products pizza type pizza size and pizza toppings most of our stores carry two or three sizes of traditional handtossed brooklyn style and crunchy thin crust pizza our typical store also offers domino’s handmade pan pizzas domino’s american legends ® pizzas domino’s oven baked sandwiches boneless chicken and wings cinna stix ®  chocolate lava crunch cakes stuffed cheesy bread parmesan bread bites and cocacola ® soft drink products we also occasionally offer other products on a promotional or a regional basis such as salads we believe that our focused menu creates a strong identity among consumers improves operating efficiency and maintains food quality and consistency 

efficient order taking production and delivery 

each store executes an operational process that includes order taking pizza preparation cooking via automated conveyordriven ovens boxing and delivery the entire order taking and pizza production process is designed for completion in approximately 1215 minutes these operational processes are supplemented by an extensive employee training program designed to ensure worldclass quality and customer service it is our priority to ensure that every domino’s store operates in an efficient consistent manner while maintaining our high standards of food quality and team member safety 

domino’s pulse™ pointofsale system with stateoftheart digital ordering capabilities 

our computerized management information systems are designed to improve operating efficiencies provide corporate management with timely access to financial and marketing data and reduce store and corporate administrative time and expense we have installed domino’s pulse™ our proprietary pointofsale system in every companyowned store in the united states in more than 99 of our domestic franchise stores and in nearly 60 of the international stores domino’s pulse™ features include 

 

  

  

  

 we require our domestic franchisees to install and maintain domino’s pulse™ additionally domino’s pulse ™ has been installed in over 3400 international franchise stores management believes that utilizing domino’s pulse™ throughout our domestic system and a growing portion of our global system provides us with competitive advantages over other pointofsales systems including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

since the rollout of domino’s pulse ™ to our domestic stores our online ordering transactions have grown currently on average approximately 40 of our domestic stores’ sales originate online in 2010 we made the strategic decision to develop our own online ordering platform and manage this important and growing area of our business internally in 2011 we launched a new mobile application for the iphone and ipod touch to provide further convenience for our customers when ordering online in 2012 we launched a new mobile application for the android smartphone and for amazon’s kindle fire and we also launched a new spanishlanguage ordering mobile application for smartphones in 2013 we launched our enhanced online ordering profiles platform allowing customers the ability to reorder their favorite order in as few as five clicks or about 30 seconds we intend to continue to enhance and grow our online ordering capabilities 

comprehensive store operations evaluation program 

we utilize a comprehensive evaluation program to ensure that our stores are meeting both our stringent standards as well as the expectations of our customers the program focuses primarily on the quality of the pizza the store is producing the customer service the store is providing and the condition of the store as viewed by the customer we believe that this program is an integral part of our strategy to maintain high standards in our stores 

segment overview 

we operate in three business segments 

 

  

  

 domestic stores 

during 2013 our domestic stores segment accounted for 5498 million or 31 of our consolidated revenues our domestic franchises are operated by entrepreneurs who own and operate an average of five stores ten of our domestic franchisees operate more than 50 stores including our largest domestic franchisee who operates 135 stores our principal sources of revenues from domestic store operations are companyowned store sales and royalty payments based on retail sales by our franchisees our domestic network of companyowned stores also plays an important strategic role in our predominantly franchised operating structure in addition to generating revenues and earnings we use our domestic companyowned stores as test sites for new products and promotions as well as store operational improvements and as forums for training new store managers and prospective franchisees we also believe that our domestic companyowned stores add to the economies of scale available for advertising marketing and other costs that are primarily borne by our franchisees while we continue to be primarily a franchised business we continually evaluate our mix of domestic companyowned and franchise stores in an effort to optimize our longterm profitability 

our domestic companyowned store operations are divided into eight geographic areas located throughout the contiguous united states while our domestic franchise operations are divided into four regions our team members within these areas provide direct supervision over our domestic companyowned stores provide training store operational audits and marketing services and provide financial analysis and store development services to our franchisees we maintain a close relationship with our franchise stores through regional franchise teams an array of computerbased training materials that help franchise stores comply with our standards and franchise advisory groups that facilitate communications between us and our franchisees 

 

domestic supply chain 

during 2013 our domestic supply chain segment accounted for 101 billion or 56 of our consolidated revenues our domestic supply chain segment is comprised primarily of 16 regional dough manufacturing and supply chain centers that manufacture fresh dough on a daily basis and purchase receive store and deliver quality pizzarelated food products and other complementary items to all of our companyowned stores and over 99 of our domestic franchise stores on average each regional dough manufacturing and supply chain center serves approximately 300 stores generally located within a oneday delivery radius we regularly supply nearly 5000 stores with various supplies and ingredients of which nine product groups account for over 90 of the volume our domestic supply chain segment made approximately 523000 fullservice deliveries in 2013 or approximately two deliveries per store per week and we produced over 300 million pounds of dough during 2013 

we believe that our franchisees voluntarily choose to obtain food supplies and equipment from us because we offer the most efficient convenient and costeffective alternative while also offering both quality and consistency in addition our domestic supply chain segment offers a profitsharing arrangement to franchisees that purchase all of their food for their stores from our domestic dough manufacturing and supply chain centers this profitsharing arrangement generally offers domestic companyowned stores and participating franchisees with 50 or a higher percentage in the case of companyowned stores and certain franchisees who operate a larger number of stores of their regional supply chain center’s pretax profits profits are shared with the franchisees based upon each franchisee’s purchases from our supply chain centers we believe these arrangements strengthen our ties with these franchisees 

the information systems used by our domestic dough manufacturing and supply chain centers are an integral part of the quality service we provide our stores we use routing strategies and software to optimize our daily delivery schedules which maximizes ontime deliveries through our strategically located dough manufacturing and supply chain center locations and proven routing systems we achieved a fill rate of over 99 during 2013 our supply chain center drivers unload food and supplies and stock store shelves typically during nonpeak store hours which minimize disruptions in store operations 

international 

during 2013 our international segment accounted for 2426 million or 13 of our consolidated revenues at december 29 2013 we had 5900 international franchise stores the principal sources of revenues from our international operations are royalty payments generated by retail sales from franchise stores and sales of food and supplies to franchisees in certain markets 

we have grown by nearly 2200 international stores over the past five years during 2013 we had 573 net international store openings including 125 net stores in india 76 net stores in turkey 51 net stores in the united kingdom 42 net stores in japan and 41 net stores in australia our international franchisees adapt our standard operating model within certain parameters to satisfy the local eating habits and consumer preferences of various regions outside the united states currently most of our international stores are operated under master franchise agreements and we plan to continue entering into master franchise agreements with qualified franchisees to expand our international operations in selected markets we believe that our international franchise stores appeal to potential franchisees because of our wellrecognized brand name the limited capital expenditures required to open and operate our stores and our system’s favorable store economics while we have a significant presence in our top ten international markets we believe that our current store base is approximately half of the total longterm potential store base in those markets of these top ten markets there are four master franchise companies that are publicly traded on stock exchanges in australia india mexico and the united kingdom which collectively oversee seven of these top ten markets the following table shows our store count as of december 29 2013 in our top ten international markets which account for approximately 73 of our international stores 

 

  

domestic franchise program 

as of december 29 2013 our 4596 domestic franchise stores were owned and operated by our 958 domestic franchisees the success of our franchise formula which enables franchisees to benefit from our brand name with a relatively low initial capital investment has attracted a large number of motivated entrepreneurs as franchisees as of december 29 2013 the average domestic franchisee owned and operated five stores and had been in our franchise system for nearly sixteen years at the same time ten of our domestic franchisees operated more than 50 stores including our largest domestic franchisee who operates 135 stores and 372 of our domestic franchisees operate a single store 

franchisees 

we apply rigorous standards to prospective franchisees we generally require prospective domestic franchisees to manage a store for at least one year before being granted a franchise this enables us to observe the operational and financial performance of a potential franchisee prior to entering into a longterm contract we also generally restrict the ability of domestic franchisees to be involved in other businesses which focuses our franchisees’ attention on operating their stores as a result the vast majority of our domestic franchisees have historically come from within the domino’s pizza system we believe these standards are largely unique to the franchise industry and result in qualified and focused franchisees operating their stores 

franchise agreements 

we enter into franchise agreements with domestic franchisees under which the franchisee is granted the right to operate a store in a particular location for a term of ten years with options to renew for an additional term of ten years we currently have a franchise contract renewal rate of approximately 99 under the current standard franchise agreement we assign an exclusive area of primary responsibility to each franchise store during the term of the franchise agreement the franchisee is required to pay a 55 royalty fee on sales subject in limited instances to lower rates based on area development agreements sales initiatives and new store incentives we have the contractual right subject to state law to terminate a franchise agreement for a variety of reasons including but not limited to a franchisee’s failure to make required payments when due or failure to adhere to specified company policies and standards 

franchise store development 

we assist domestic franchisees with selecting store sites and conforming the space to the physical specifications required for a domino’s pizza store each domestic franchisee selects the location and design for each store subject to our approval based on accessibility and visibility of the site and demographic factors including population density and anticipated traffic levels we also sell fixtures and equipment to many of our franchise stores 

international franchise program 

franchisees 

the vast majority of our markets outside of the contiguous united states are operated by master franchisees with franchise and distribution rights for entire regions or countries in a few select markets we franchise directly to individual store operators prospective master franchisees are required to possess or have access to local market knowledge required to establish and develop domino’s pizza stores the local market knowledge focuses on the ability to identify and access targeted real estate sites along with expertise in local customs culture consumer behavior and laws we also seek candidates that have access to sufficient capital to meet growth and development plans 

master franchise agreements 

our master franchise agreements generally grant the franchisee exclusive rights to develop or subfranchise stores and the right to operate supply chain centers in a particular geographic area for a term of 10 to 20 years with options to renew for additional terms the agreements typically contain growth clauses requiring franchisees to open a minimum number of stores within a specified period the master franchisee is generally required to pay an initial onetime franchise fee as well as an additional franchise fee upon the opening of each new store in addition the master franchisee is required to pay a continuing royalty fee as a percentage of retail sales which varies among international markets and averaged approximately 31 in 2013 

 

franchise training and support 

training store managers and employees is a critical component of our success we require all domestic franchisees to complete initial and ongoing training programs provided by us in addition under the standard domestic franchise agreement domestic franchisees are required to implement training programs for their store employees we assist our domestic and international franchisees by making certain training materials available to them for their use in training store managers and employees including computerbased training materials comprehensive operations manuals and franchise development classes we also maintain communications with our franchisees online through various newsletters electronic communications and through facetoface meetings 

franchise operations 

we enforce stringent standards over franchise operations to protect the domino’s pizza ® brand all franchisees are required to operate their stores in compliance with written policies standards and specifications which include matters such as menu items ingredients materials supplies services furnishings decor and signs each franchisee owns and operates their own stores and controls the daytoday operations of their respective stores we also provide ongoing support to our franchisees including training marketing assistance and consultation to franchisees who experience financial or operational difficulties we have established several advisory boards through which franchisees contribute to developing systemwide initiatives 

domino’s reimage campaign 

we have embarked upon a systemwide campaign to reimage our stores in accordance with our franchise contracts this campaign designed to improve our brand image and instore customer experience involves upgrading store interiors and store signs as part of this campaign we expect to relocate a certain number of stores to improve our brand visibility our reimage campaign formally began in november 2013 and we and our franchisees plan to continue to reimage and relocate our domestic stores until each store meets our new image standards our plan is that we and our franchisees will be significantly complete in relocating or reimaging our domestic franchise and companyowned stores by the end of 2017 

marketing operations 

our domestic stores have historically contributed 4 or 5 of their retail sales to fund national marketing and advertising campaigns with additional required contributions to local marketlevel programs beginning in 2010 all domestic franchisees contributed 55 subject in limited instances to lower rates based on certain incentives and waivers of their retail sales for national advertising in january 2013 with the support of the domestic franchise system domestic franchisees amended their standard franchise agreements to require a contribution of 6 subject in limited instances to lower rates based on certain incentives and waivers of their retail sales for national advertising we currently anticipate that this 6 contribution rate which took effect in 2013 will remain in place for the foreseeable future in those markets where we have cooperative advertising programs our domestic stores are still able to contribute to marketlevel media campaigns at their discretion these national and marketlevel funds are administered by domino’s national advertising fund inc or dnaf our notforprofit advertising subsidiary the funds remitted to dnaf are used primarily to purchase media for advertising but also support market research field communications public relations commercial production talent payments and other activities supporting the domino’s pizza ® brand dnaf also provides costeffective print resources to our domestic stores for use in local marketing that reinforce our national branding strategy in addition to the national and marketlevel advertising contributions domestic stores spend additional amounts on local store marketing including targeted database mailings saturation print mailings and community involvement through school and civic organizations additionally we may occasionally partner with other organizations in an effort to promote the domino’s pizza ® brand 

by communicating a common brand message at the national local market and store levels we create and reinforce a powerful consistent marketing message to consumers this is evidenced by our successful marketing campaign with the slogan “oh yes we did” since introducing our improved pizza recipe and this new marketing campaign in the fourth quarter of 2009 we have received significant attention in the news media social networking internet sites and other media outlets and have experienced positive same store sales growth in our domestic stores over the past five years we estimate that domestic stores have invested approximately 14 billion in national local and cooperative advertising in the united states 

internationally franchisees also commit significant dollars in advertising efforts in their markets and these marketing efforts are the responsibility of the franchisee in each local market we assist international franchisees with their marketing efforts through marketing workshops and knowledge sharing of best practices and successful concepts 

 

thirdparty suppliers 

we have maintained active relationships of 20 years or more with more than half of our major thirdparty suppliers our supply partners are required to meet strict quality standards to ensure food safety we review and evaluate our supply partners’ quality assurance programs through among other actions onsite visits third party audits and product evaluations to ensure compliance with our standards we believe that the length and quality of our relationships with thirdparty suppliers provides us with priority service and quality products at competitive prices 

we believe that two factors have been critical to maintaining longlasting relationships and keeping our purchasing costs low first we are one of the largest domestic volume purchasers of pizzarelated products such as flour cheese sauce and pizza boxes which allows us to maximize leverage with our thirdparty suppliers when items are put out for bid on a scheduled basis second we use a combination of singlesource and multisource procurement strategies each supply category is evaluated along a number of criteria including value of purchasing leverage consistency of quality and reliability of supply to determine the appropriate number of thirdparty suppliers 

we currently purchase our pizza cheese from a single supplier under the arrangement with this supplier which was entered into in october 2012 the supplier agreed to provide an uninterrupted supply of cheese and the company agreed to a fiveyear pricing period during which it agreed to purchase all of its primary pizza cheese for the company’s domestic stores from this supplier or alternatively pay to the supplier an amount reflecting any benefit previously received by the company under the new pricing terms the pricing schedule is directly correlated to the chicago mercantile exchange cme block cheddar price the majority of our meat toppings come from a single supplier under a contract that began in november 2010 and expires in may 2014 we have the right to terminate these arrangements for quality failures and for uncured breaches 

we believe that alternative thirdparty suppliers for all of these ingredients are available and all of our pizza boxes sauces and other ingredients are sourced from various thirdparty suppliers while we may incur additional costs if we are required to replace any of our supply partners we do not believe that such additional costs would have a material adverse effect on our business since 2003 we have been party to a multiyear agreement with cocacola for the contiguous united states this contract was renegotiated in december 2013 and provides for cocacola to continue to be our exclusive beverage supplier and expires on december 31 2018 or at such time as a minimum number of cases of cocacola ® products are purchased by us whichever occurs last we continually evaluate each supply category to determine the optimal sourcing strategy 

we have not experienced any significant shortages of supplies or any delays in receiving our food or beverage inventories restaurant supplies or products prices charged to us by our supply partners are subject to fluctuation and we have historically been able to pass increased costs and savings on to our stores we periodically enter into supplier contracts to manage the risk from changes in commodity prices we do not engage in speculative transactions nor do we hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes 

competition 

the us and international pizza delivery and carryout segments are highly competitive domestically we compete against regional and local companies as well as national chains pizza hut ®  papa john’s ® and little caesars pizza ®  internationally we compete primarily against pizza hut ®  papa john’s ® and countryspecific national and local companies we generally compete on the basis of product quality location image service and price we also compete on a broader scale with quick service and other international national regional and local restaurants in addition the overall food service industry and the qsr sector in particular are intensely competitive with respect to product quality price service convenience and concept the industry is often affected by changes in consumer tastes economic conditions demographic trends and consumers’ disposable income we compete within the food service industry and the qsr sector not only for customers but also for employees suitable real estate sites and qualified franchisees 

government regulation 

we are subject to various federal state and local laws affecting the operation of our business as are our franchisees including various health sanitation fire and safety standards each store is subject to licensing and regulation by a number of governmental authorities which include zoning health safety sanitation building and fire agencies in the jurisdiction in which the store is located in connection with maintaining our stores we may be required to expend funds to meet certain federal state and local regulations including regulations requiring that remodeled or altered stores be accessible to persons with disabilities difficulties in obtaining or the failure to obtain required licenses or approvals could delay or prevent the opening of a new store in a particular area or cause an existing store to cease operations our supply chain facilities are also licensed and subject to similar regulations by federal state and local health and fire codes 

 

we are also subject to the fair labor standards act and various other federal and state laws governing such matters as minimum wage requirements overtime and other working conditions and citizenship requirements a significant number of our food service personnel are paid at rates related to the applicable minimum wage and past increases in the minimum wage have increased our labor costs as would future increases 

we are subject to the rules and regulations of the federal trade commission and various state laws regulating the offer and sale of franchises the federal trade commission and various state laws require that we furnish a franchise disclosure document containing certain information to prospective franchisees and a number of states require registration of the franchise disclosure document with state authorities we are operating under exemptions from registration in several states based on the net worth of our operating subsidiary domino’s pizza llc and experience substantive state laws that regulate the franchisorfranchisee relationship presently exist in a substantial number of states and bills have been introduced in congress from time to time that would provide for federal regulation of the franchisorfranchisee relationship the state laws often limit among other things the duration and scope of noncompetition provisions the ability of a franchisor to terminate or refuse to renew a franchise and the ability of a franchisor to designate sources of supply we believe that our franchise disclosure document together with any applicable state versions or supplements and franchising procedures comply in all material respects with both the federal trade commission guidelines and all applicable state laws regulating franchising in those states in which we have offered franchises 

internationally our franchise stores are subject to national and local laws and regulations that often are similar to those affecting our domestic stores including laws and regulations concerning franchises labor health sanitation and safety our international stores are also often subject to tariffs and regulations on imported commodities and equipment and laws regulating foreign investment we believe that our international disclosure statements franchise offering documents and franchising procedures comply in all material respects with the laws of the foreign countries in which we have offered franchises 

privacy and data protection 

we are subject to a number of privacy and data protection laws and regulations globally the legislative and regulatory landscape for privacy and data protection continues to evolve and there has been an increase in attention given to privacy and data protection issues with the potential to affect directly our business including recently enacted laws and regulations in the united states and internationally requiring notification to individuals and government authorities of security breaches involving certain categories of personal information we have a privacy policy posted on our website at wwwdominoscom and believe that we are in material compliance therewith 

trademarks 

we have many registered trademarks and service marks and believe that the domino’s ® mark and domino’s pizza ® names and logos in particular have significant value and are important to our business our policy is to pursue registration of our trademarks and to vigorously oppose the infringement of any of our trademarks we license the use of our registered marks to franchisees through franchise agreements 

environmental matters 

we are not aware of any federal state or local environmental laws or regulations that will materially affect our earnings or competitive position or result in material capital expenditures however we cannot predict the effect of possible future environmental legislation or regulations during 2013 there were no material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities and no such material expenditures are anticipated in 2014 

employees 

as of december 29 2013 we had approximately 10000 employees who we refer to as team members in our companyowned stores supply chain centers world resource center our corporate headquarters and regional offices none of our team members are represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement as franchisees are independent business owners they and their employees are not included in our employee count we consider our relationship with our employees and franchisees to be good we estimate the total number of people who work in the domino’s pizza system including our employees franchisees and the employees of franchisees was over 220000 as of december 29 2013

 item 1a risk factors 

the quick service restaurant pizza category is highly competitive and such competition could adversely affect our operating results 

we compete in the united states against three national chains as well as many regional and local businesses we could experience increased competition from existing or new companies in the pizza category which could create increasing pressures to grow our business in order to maintain our market share if we are unable to maintain our competitive position we could experience downward pressure on prices lower demand for our products reduced margins the inability to take advantage of new business opportunities and the loss of market share all of which would have an adverse effect on our operating results and could cause our stock price to decline 

we also compete on a broader scale with quick service and other international national regional and local restaurants the overall food service market and the quick service restaurant sector are intensely competitive with respect to food quality price service image convenience and concept and are often affected by changes in 

 

  

  

  

  

 we compete within the food service market and the quick service restaurant sector not only for customers but also for management and hourly employees suitable real estate sites and qualified franchisees our domestic supply chain segment is also subject to competition from outside suppliers while over 99 of domestic franchisees purchased food equipment and supplies from us in 2013 domestic franchisees are not required to purchase food equipment or supplies from us and they may choose to purchase from outside suppliers if other suppliers who meet our qualification standards were to offer lower prices or better service to our franchisees for their ingredients and supplies and as a result our franchisees chose not to purchase from our domestic supply chain centers our financial condition business and results of operations would be adversely affected 

if we fail to successfully implement our growth strategy which includes opening new domestic and international stores our ability to increase our revenues and operating profits could be adversely affected 

a significant component of our growth strategy includes the opening of new domestic and international stores we and our franchisees face many challenges in opening new stores including among others 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 the opening of additional franchise stores also depends in part upon the availability of prospective franchisees who meet our criteria our failure to add a significant number of new stores would adversely affect our ability to increase revenues and operating income 

we are currently planning to expand our international operations in many of the markets where we currently operate and in selected new markets this may require considerable management time as well as startup expenses for market development before any significant revenues and earnings are generated operations in new foreign markets may achieve low margins or may be unprofitable and expansion in existing markets may be affected by local economic and market conditions therefore as we expand internationally we or our franchisees may not experience the operating margins we expect our results of operations may be negatively impacted and our common stock price may decline 

we may also pursue strategic acquisitions as part of our business if we are able to identify acquisition candidates such acquisitions may be financed to the extent permitted under our debt agreements with substantial debt or with potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities 

 

the food service market is affected by consumer preferences and perceptions changes in these preferences and perceptions may lessen the demand for our products which would reduce sales and harm our business 

food service businesses are affected by changes in consumer tastes international national regional and local economic conditions and demographic trends for instance if prevailing health or dietary preferences cause consumers to avoid pizza and other products we offer in favor of foods that are perceived as more healthy our business and operating results would be harmed moreover because we are primarily dependent on a single product if consumer demand for pizza should decrease our business would suffer more than if we had a more diversified menu as many other food service businesses do 

reports of foodborne illness or food tampering could reduce sales and harm our business 

reports whether true or not of foodborne illnesses such as e coli avian flu bovine spongiform encephalopathy hepatitis a trichinosis or salmonella and injuries caused by food tampering have in the past severely injured the reputations of participants in the qsr sector and could in the future as well the potential for acts of terrorism on our global food supply also exists and if such an event occurs it could have a negative impact on us and could severely hurt sales and profits in addition our reputation is an important asset as a result anything that damages our reputation could immediately and severely affect our sales and profits media reports of illnesses and injuries whether accurate or not could force some stores to close or otherwise reduce sales at such stores in addition reports of foodborne illnesses or food tampering even those occurring solely at the restaurants of competitors could by resulting in negative publicity about the restaurant industry adversely affect us on a local regional national or international basis 

increases in food labor and other costs could adversely affect our profitability and operating results 

an increase in our operating costs could adversely affect our profitability factors such as inflation increased food costs increased labor and employee health and benefit costs increased rent costs and increased energy costs may adversely affect our operating costs most of the factors affecting costs are beyond our control and in many cases we may not be able to pass along these increased costs to our customers or franchisees most ingredients used in our pizza particularly cheese are subject to significant price fluctuations as a result of seasonality weather demand and other factors the cheese block price per pound averaged 175 in 2013 and the estimated increase in companyowned store food costs from a hypothetical 025 adverse change in the average cheese block price per pound would have been approximately 21 million in 2013 labor costs are largely a function of the minimum wage for a majority of our store personnel and certain supply chain center personnel and generally are also a function of the availability of labor food including cheese costs and labor represent approximately 50 to 60 of a typical companyowned store’s sales 

we do not have longterm contracts with certain of our suppliers and as a result they could seek to significantly increase prices or fail to deliver 

we do not have longterm contracts or arrangements with certain of our suppliers although in the past we have not experienced significant problems with our suppliers our suppliers may implement significant price increases or may not meet our requirements in a timely fashion or at all the occurrence of any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

shortages or interruptions in the supply or delivery of fresh food products could adversely affect our operating results 

we and our franchisees are dependent on frequent deliveries of fresh food products that meet our specifications shortages or interruptions in the supply of fresh food products caused by unanticipated demand problems in production or distribution financial or other difficulties of suppliers inclement weather or other conditions could adversely affect the availability quality and cost of ingredients which would adversely affect our operating results 

any prolonged disruption in the operations of any of our dough manufacturing and supply chain centers could harm our business 

we operate 16 regional dough manufacturing and supply chain centers one thin crust manufacturing center and one vegetable processing center in the contiguous united states and a total of seven dough manufacturing and supply chain centers in alaska hawaii and canada our domestic dough manufacturing and supply chain centers service all of our companyowned stores and over 99 of our domestic franchise stores as a result any prolonged disruption in the operations of any of these facilities whether due to technical or labor difficulties destruction or damage to the facility real estate issues or other reasons could adversely affect our business and operating results 

 

our success depends in part upon effective advertising and lower advertising funds may reduce our ability to adequately market the domino’s pizza ® brand 

we have been routinely named a megabrand by advertising age each domino’s store located in the contiguous united states is obligated to pay a percentage of its sales in advertising fees in fiscal 2013 each store in the contiguous united states generally was required to contribute 6 of their sales to dnaf subject in limited instances to lower rates based on certain incentives and waivers which uses such fees for national advertising in addition to contributions for local marketlevel advertising we currently anticipate that this 6 contribution rate will remain in place for the foreseeable future while additional funds for advertising in the past have been provided by us our franchisees and other third parties none of these additional funds are legally required the lack of continued financial support for advertising activities could significantly curtail our marketing efforts which may in turn materially and adversely affect our business and our operating results 

we face risks of litigation and negative publicity from customers franchisees suppliers employees and others in the ordinary course of business which can or could divert our financial and management resources any adverse litigation or publicity may negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations 

claims of illness or injury relating to food quality or food handling are common in the food service industry and vehicular accidents and injuries occur in the food delivery business claims within our industry of improper supplier actions have also recently arisen that if made against one of our suppliers could potentially damage our brand image in addition class action lawsuits have been filed and may continue to be filed against various quick service restaurants alleging among other things that quick service restaurants have failed to disclose the health risks associated with highfat foods and that quick service restaurant marketing practices have encouraged obesity in addition to decreasing our sales and profitability and diverting our management resources adverse publicity or a substantial judgment against us could negatively impact our financial condition results of operations and brand reputation thereby hindering our ability to attract and retain franchisees and grow our business 

further we may be subject to employee franchisee and other claims in the future based on among other things discrimination harassment wrongful termination and wage rest break and meal break issues and those claims relating to overtime compensation we are currently subject to these types of claims and have been subject to these types of claims in the past if one or more of these claims were to be successful or if there is a significant increase in the number of these claims or if we receive significant negative publicity our business financial condition and operating results could be harmed 

loss of key employees or our inability to attract and retain new qualified employees could hurt our business and inhibit our ability to operate and grow successfully 

our success in the highly competitive pizza delivery and carryout business will continue to depend to a significant extent on our leadership team and other key management personnel other than with our president and chief executive officer j patrick doyle we do not have longterm employment agreements with any of our executive officers as a result we may not be able to retain our executive officers and key personnel or attract additional qualified management while we do not have longterm employment agreements with our executive officers for all of our executive officers we have noncompete and nonsolicitation agreements that extend for 24 months following the termination of such executive officer’s employment our success also will continue to depend on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel to operate our stores dough manufacturing and supply chain centers and international operations the loss of these employees or our inability to recruit and retain qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 

 

our international operations subject us to additional risk such risks and costs may differ in each country in which we and our franchisees do business and may cause our profitability to decline due to increased costs 

we conduct a significant portion of our business outside the united states our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected if global markets in which our franchise stores compete are affected by changes in political economic or other factors these factors over which neither we nor our franchisees have control may include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 adverse economic conditions and the global debt crisis subject us to additional risk 

our financial condition and results of operations are impacted by global markets and economic conditions over which neither we nor our franchisees have control an economic downturn may result in a reduction in the demand for our products longer payment cycles slower adoption of new technologies and increased price competition poor economic conditions may adversely affect the ability of our franchisees to pay royalties or amounts owed and could have a material adverse impact on our ability to pursue our growth strategy which would reduce cash collections and in turn may materially and adversely affect our ability to service our debt obligations 

deterioration of the market value of sovereign debt of several european countries together with the risk of contagion to other more stable countries could result in fiscal reforms including austerity measures sovereign debt restructurings currency instability increased counterparty credit risk high levels of volatility and potentially disruptions in the credit and equity markets as well as other outcomes that might adversely impact us with respect to currency instability concerns exist in the eurozone over the overall stability of the euro and the suitability of the euro as a single currency given the diverse economic and political circumstances among countries that use the euro as their currency these concerns could lead to the reintroduction of individual currencies in one or more of these countries or in more extreme circumstances the possible dissolution of the euro currency entirely should the euro dissolve entirely the legal and contractual consequences for holders of euro denominated obligations would be determined by laws in effect at such time in addition the capital market disruption that would likely accompany any such redenomination event could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity and financial condition furthermore any redenomination event would likely be accompanied by significant economic dislocation particularly within the eurozone countries which in turn could have an adverse impact on demand for our products and accordingly on our revenue and cash flows as of december 29 2013 we had 1855 stores in europe up from 975 at 2008 year end

fluctuations in the value of the us dollar in relation to other currencies may lead to lower revenues and earnings 

exchange rate fluctuations could have an adverse effect on our results of operations approximately 122 of our total revenues in 2011 130 of our total revenues in 2012 and 135 of our total revenues in 2013 were derived from our international segment a majority of which were denominated in foreign currencies sales made by franchise stores outside the united states are denominated in the currency of the country in which the store is located and this currency could become less valuable in us dollars as a result of exchange rate fluctuations unfavorable currency fluctuations could lead to increased prices to customers outside the united states or lower profitability to our franchisees outside the united states or could result in lower revenues for us on a us dollar basis from such customers and franchisees a hypothetical 10 adverse change in the foreign currency rates in each of our top ten international markets based on store count would have resulted in a negative impact on revenues of approximately 97 million in 2013 

 

we may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property which could harm the value of our brand and branded products and adversely affect our business 

we depend in large part on our brand and branded products and believe that they are very important to our business we rely on a combination of trademarks copyrights service marks trade secrets and similar intellectual property rights to protect our brand and branded products the success of our business depends on our continued ability to use our existing trademarks and service marks in order to increase brand awareness and further develop our branded products in both domestic and international markets we have registered certain trademarks and have other trademark registrations pending in the united states and foreign jurisdictions not all of the trademarks that we currently use have been registered in all of the countries in which we do business and they may never be registered in all of these countries we may not be able to adequately protect our trademarks and our use of these trademarks may result in liability for trademark infringement trademark dilution or unfair competition all of the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property in the united states and in foreign countries may not be adequate in addition the laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states further through acquisitions of third parties we may acquire brands and related trademarks that are subject to the same risks as the brands and trademarks we currently own 

we may from time to time be required to institute litigation to enforce our trademarks or other intellectual property rights or to protect our trade secrets such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could negatively affect our sales profitability and prospects regardless of whether we are able to successfully enforce our rights 

our earnings and business growth strategy depends on the success of our franchisees and we may be harmed by actions taken by our franchisees or employees of our franchisees that are outside of our control 

a significant portion of our earnings comes from royalties generated by our franchise stores franchisees are independent operators and their employees are not our employees we provide limited training and support to franchisees but the quality of franchise store operations may be diminished by any number of factors beyond our control consequently franchisees may not successfully operate stores in a manner consistent with our standards and requirements or may not hire and train qualified managers and other store employees if they do not our image and reputation may suffer and as a result our revenues and stock price could decline while we try to ensure that our franchisees maintain the quality of our brand and branded products our franchisees may take actions that adversely affect the value of our intellectual property or reputation as of december 29 2013 we had 958 domestic franchisees operating 4596 domestic stores ten of these franchisees each operate over 50 domestic stores including our largest domestic franchisee who operates 135 stores and the average franchisee owns and operates five stores 

in addition our international master franchisees are generally responsible for the development of significantly more stores than our domestic franchisees as a result our international operations are more closely tied to the success of a smaller number of franchisees than our domestic operations our largest international master franchisee operates 1270 stores in six markets which accounts for approximately 22 of our total international store count our domestic and international franchisees may not operate their franchises successfully if one or more of our key franchisees were to become insolvent or otherwise were unable or unwilling to pay us our royalties or other amounts owed our business and results of operations would be adversely affected 

interruption failure or compromise of our information technology communications systems and electronic data could hurt our ability to effectively serve our customers and protect customer data which could damage our reputation and adversely affect our business and operating results 

a significant portion of our retail sales depends on the continuing operation of our information technology and communications systems including but not limited to domino’s pulse™ our online ordering platform and our credit card processing systems our information technology communication systems and electronic data may be vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes terrorist attacks floods fires power loss telecommunications failures computer viruses loss of data unauthorized data breaches or other attempts to harm our systems additionally we operate data centers that are also subject to breakins sabotage and intentional acts of vandalism that could cause disruptions in our ability to serve our customers and protect customer data some of our systems are not fully redundant and our disaster recovery planning cannot account for all eventualities the occurrence of a natural disaster intentional sabotage or other unanticipated problems could result in lengthy interruptions in our service any errors or vulnerabilities in our systems or damage to or failure of our systems could result in interruptions in our services and noncompliance with certain regulations which could reduce our revenues and profits and damage our business and brand 

 

we rely on proprietary and commercially available systems software tools and monitoring to provide security for processing transmission and storage of confidential customer information such as payment card and personal information and any unauthorized data breaches could damage our reputation and adversely affect our business  

unauthorized intrusion into the portions of our computer systems or those of our franchisees that process and store information related to customer transactions may result in the theft of customer data furthermore the systems currently used for transmission and approval of payment card transactions and the technology utilized in payment cards themselves all of which can put payment card data at risk are determined and mandated by payment card industry standards not by us in addition to improper activities by third parties bugs in newlydeployed or early stage advances in hardware and software capabilities encryption technology and other events or developments may facilitate or result in a compromise or breach of our computer systems any such compromises or breaches could cause interruptions in operations and damage to the reputation of the domino’s pizza ® brand subject us to costs and liabilities and hurt sales revenues and profits 

we are subject to extensive government regulation and requirements issued by other groups and our failure to comply with existing or increased regulations could adversely affect our business and operating results 

we are subject to numerous federal state local and foreign laws and regulations as well as requirements issued by other groups including those relating to 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 the patient protection and affordable care act requires employers such as us to provide health insurance for all qualifying employees or pay penalties for not providing coverage we are evaluating the impact the new law will have on us and although we cannot predict with certainty the financial and operational impacts the new law will have we expect that the requirement to provide expanded health care coverage to employees above what we currently provide could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position as well as an adverse effect on some of our larger franchisees we anticipate that the majority of the increases in these costs will begin in 2015 and escalate in subsequent years such increases may be large enough to materially impact labor costs for us and our franchisees 

we may also become subject to legislation or regulation seeking to tax andor regulate highfat foods foods with high sugar and salt content or foods otherwise deemed to be “unhealthy” if we fail to comply with existing or future laws and regulations we may be subject to governmental or judicial fines or sanctions in addition our capital expenditures could increase due to remediation measures that may be required if we are found to be noncompliant with any of these laws or regulations 

we are also subject to a federal trade commission rule and to various state and foreign laws that govern the offer and sale of franchises additionally these laws regulate various aspects of the franchise relationship including terminations and the refusal to renew franchises the failure to comply with these laws and regulations in any jurisdiction or to obtain required government approvals could result in a ban or temporary suspension on future franchise sales fines or other penalties or require us to make offers of rescission or restitution any of which could adversely affect our business and operating results 

 

our current insurance coverage may not be adequate insurance premiums for such coverage may increase and we may not be able to obtain insurance at acceptable rates or at all 

we have retention programs for workers’ compensation general liability and owned and nonowned automobile liabilities we are generally responsible for up to 10 million per occurrence under these retention programs for workers’ compensation and general liability we are also generally responsible for between 500000 and 30 million per occurrence under these retention programs for owned and nonowned automobile liabilities total insurance limits under these retention programs vary depending upon the period covered and range up to 1100 million per occurrence for general liability and owned and nonowned automobile liabilities and up to the applicable statutory limits for workers’ compensation these insurance policies may not be adequate to protect us from liabilities that we incur in our business in addition in the future our insurance premiums may increase and we may not be able to obtain similar levels of insurance on reasonable terms or at all any such inadequacy of or inability to obtain insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our annual and quarterly financial results are subject to significant fluctuations depending on various factors many of which are beyond our control and if we fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors our share price may decline significantly 

our sales and operating results can vary significantly from quartertoquarter and yeartoyear depending on various factors many of which are beyond our control these factors include among other things 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 as a result our operational performance may decline quickly and significantly in response to changes in order patterns or rapid decreases in demand for our products we anticipate that fluctuations in operating results will continue in the future 

our common stock price could be subject to significant fluctuations andor may decline 

the market price of our common stock could be subject to significant fluctuations among the factors that could affect our stock price are 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 the stock markets in general have experienced volatility that has sometimes been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies these broad market fluctuations may cause the trading price of our common stock to decline 

 

our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our business and limit our ability to plan for or respond to changes in our business 

we have a substantial amount of indebtedness as of december 29 2013 our consolidated longterm indebtedness was approximately 154 billion we may also incur additional debt which would not be prohibited under the terms of our current securitized debt agreements our substantial indebtedness could have important consequences to our business and our shareholders for example it could 

 

  

  

  

 in addition the financial and other covenants we agreed to with our lenders may limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness make investments pay dividends and engage in other transactions and the leverage may cause potential lenders to be less willing to loan funds to us in the future our failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default that if not cured or waived could result in the acceleration of repayment of all of our indebtedness 

we may be unable to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our significant debt service obligations which would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

our ability to make principal and interest payments on and to refinance our indebtedness will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future this to a certain extent is subject to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control if our business does not generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the amounts projected or at all or if future borrowings are not available to us under our variable funding notes in amounts sufficient to fund our other liquidity needs our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected if we cannot generate sufficient cash flow from operations to make scheduled principal amortization and interest payments on our debt obligations in the future we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity sell assets delay capital expenditures or seek additional equity if we are unable to refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all or to effect any other action relating to our indebtedness on satisfactory terms or at all our business may be harmed 

the terms of our securitized debt financing of certain of our whollyowned subsidiaries have restrictive terms and our failure to comply with any of these terms could put us in default which would have an adverse effect on our business and prospects 

unless and until we repay all outstanding borrowings under our securitized debt we will remain subject to the restrictive terms of these borrowings the securitized debt under which certain of our whollyowned subsidiaries issued and guaranteed fixed rate notes and variable funding senior revolving notes contain a number of covenants with the most significant financial covenant being a debt service coverage calculation these covenants limit the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to among other things 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 the securitized debt also requires us to maintain specified financial ratios at the end of each fiscal quarter these restrictions could affect our ability to pay dividends or repurchase shares of our common stock our ability to meet these financial ratios can be affected by events beyond our control and we may not satisfy such a test a breach of this covenant could result in a rapid amortization event or default under the securitized debt if amounts owed under the securitized debt are accelerated because of a default under the securitized debt and we are unable to pay such amounts the investors may have the right to assume control of substantially all of the securitized assets 

 

during the sevenyear term following issuance the outstanding senior notes will accrue interest at a fixed rate of 5216 per year additionally the senior notes have scheduled principal amortization payments of 236 million in 2014 295 million in 2015 374 million in 2016 394 million in each of 2017 and 2018 and 98 million in 2019 if we meet certain conditions including maximum leverage ratios of less than 45x total debt to ebitda we may elect to not make the scheduled principal payments if one of the leverage ratios subsequently exceeds 45x we must make up the payments we had elected not to make 

if we are unable to refinance or repay amounts under the securitized debt prior to the expiration of the sevenyear term our cash flow would be directed to the repayment of the securitized debt and other than a weekly management fee sufficient to cover minimal selling general and administrative expenses would not be available for operating our business 

no assurance can be given that any refinancing or additional financing will be possible when needed or that we will be able to negotiate acceptable terms in addition our access to capital is affected by prevailing conditions in the financial and capital markets and other factors beyond our control there can be no assurance that market conditions will be favorable at the times that we require new or additional financing 

the indenture governing the securitized debt will restrict the cash flow from the entities subject to the securitization to any of our other entities and upon the occurrence of certain events cash flow would be further restricted 

in the event that a rapid amortization event occurs under the indenture including without limitation upon an event of default under the indenture or the failure to repay the securitized debt at the end of the sevenyear term the funds available to us would be reduced or eliminated which would in turn reduce our ability to operate or grow our business

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend overview 

our fiscal year typically includes 52 weeks comprised of three twelveweek quarters and one sixteenweek quarter every five or six years our fiscal year includes an extra or 53 rd  week in the fourth quarter fiscal 2011 fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2013 each consisted of 52 weeks 

description of the business 

we are the number one pizza delivery company in the united states with a 236 share of the pizza delivery market and the second largest pizza company in the carryout segment based on reported consumer spending we also have a leading international presence ranking as the second largest pizza company in the world based on number of units and retail sales we operate through a network of 390 companyowned stores all of which are in the united states and 10496 franchise stores located in all 50 states and in more than 70 international markets in addition we operate 19 regional manufacturing and supply chain centers in the contiguous united states as well as seven dough manufacturing and supply chain centers outside the contiguous united states 

our financial results are driven largely by retail sales at our franchise and companyowned stores changes in retail sales are driven by changes in same store sales and store counts we monitor both of these metrics very closely as they directly impact our revenues and profits and strive to consistently increase both same store sales and our store counts retail sales drive royalty payments from franchisees as well as companyowned store and supply chain revenues retail sales are primarily impacted by the strength of the domino’s pizza ® brand the results of our marketing promotions our ability to execute our store operating model the overall global economic environment and the success of our business strategies 

we devote significant attention to our brandbuilding efforts which is evident in our system’s estimated 14 billion of domestic advertising spending over the past five years and our frequent designation as a megabrand by advertising age  additionally our international franchisees invest significant amounts in advertising efforts in their markets we plan on continuing to build our brand and retail sales by satisfying customers worldwide with our pizza delivery and carryout offerings and by continuing to invest significant amounts in the advertising and marketing of the domino’s pizza ® brand 

we also pay particular attention to the store economics or the investment performance of a store to its owner of both our franchise and companyowned stores we believe that our system’s favorable store economics benefit from the relatively small initial and ongoing investments required to own and operate a domino’s pizza store we believe these favorable investment requirements coupled with a strong brand message supported by significant advertising spending as well as highquality and focused menu offerings drive strong store economics which in turn drive demand for new stores 

business performance 

during 2013 the company continued to produce steady consistent results with strong earnings growth and cash flows the company produced positive order count growth sales growth and store growth domestically while also producing sales growth and record store growth internationally the results in 2013 demonstrated that we continue to deliver the products service and value that are resonating with our global consumers we have continued to improve store level profitability for our domestic franchise and companyowned stores in 2013 further over the past several years our focus domestically has been improving our company through several initiatives including investments to improve upon our menu marketing technology operations and franchise base in 2012 we launched our new handmade pan pizza which we believe has been an important driver in the success of our domestic stores over the past two years technology remains a focus for us as digital orders continue to grow in 2011 we launched a new mobile application for the iphone and ipod touch and in 2012 we launched a new mobile application for the android smartphone and for amazon’s kindle fire in 2013 we launched our enhanced online ordering profiles platform allowing customers the ability to reorder their favorite order in as few as five clicks or about 30 seconds we believe our new product platforms combined with an innovative transparent and effective advertising campaign continued focus on operational excellence and new technology generated strong sales and earnings growth for the company in 2011 2012 and 2013 additionally we have implemented a relocation and reimaging campaign aimed at increasing store sales and market share through improved brand visibility we believe our accomplishments and efforts in each of these areas will improve our brand image and brand positioning in the future 

 

our international division continued to post strong same store sales growth 62 in 2013 and had a record 573 net store openings including 125 net stores in india 76 net stores in turkey 51 net stores in the united kingdom 42 net stores in japan and 41 net stores in australia continued strong same store sales growth combined with continued store count growth demonstrate the consistency and reliability of this growing business segment 

these strong results from both our domestic and international stores produced earnings growth and increased cash flows in 2013 we believe that our franchise business model provides a solid structure on which to build consistent retail sales and store growth that results in strong cash flows that we can deploy to drive shareholder value 

worldwide store counts have increased from 9351 at the beginning of 2011 to 10886 at the end of 2013 this growth in store counts can be attributed to the global growth of our brand and our pizza delivery and carryout concepts as well as the economics inherent in our system which attract new franchisees and encourage existing franchisees to grow their businesses domestic same store sales increased 35 in 2011 31 in 2012 and 54 in 2013 the increase in domestic same store sales throughout the past three years was attributable to our innovative and effective advertising campaign for our improved pizza recipe continued focus on operational excellence innovative technology initiatives and efforts to strengthen our franchisee base the company experienced traffic increases in our domestic stores in 2011 2012 and 2013 international same store sales increased 68 in 2011 52 in 2012 and 62 in 2013 internationally same stores sales growth continues to result from the growing acceptance of pizza and delivered pizza around the globe and the successful execution of the domino’s pizza concept 

in 2013 global retail sales which are total retail sales at companyowned and franchise stores worldwide increased 82 as compared to 2012 retail sales for franchise stores are reported to the company by its franchisees and are not included in company revenues this increase was driven primarily by both domestic and international same store sales growth as well as an increase in our worldwide store counts during the trailing four quarters offset in part by the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates domestic same store sales growth reflected the sustained positive sales trends and the continued success of our new products and promotions international same store sales growth reflected continued strong performance in the markets where we compete in 2012 global retail sales increased 65 as compared to 2011 driven primarily by both domestic and international same store sales growth as well as an increase in our worldwide store counts during the trailing four quarters offset in part by the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates 

our revenues increased 1238 million or 74 in 2013 and increased 262 million or 16 in 2012 the increase in revenues in 2013 was driven primarily by higher supply chain revenues due to higher volumes from increased store order counts higher commodity prices and a change in the mix of products sold higher international revenues attributable to same store sales and store count growth and higher domestic franchise and companyowned store revenues due to an increase in same store sales these increases were offset in part by the negative impact on international revenues from changes in foreign currency exchange rates the increase in revenues in 2012 was driven by higher international revenues attributable to same store sales and store count growth higher supply chain revenues due primarily to a change in the mix of products sold offset in part by slightly lower volumes and higher domestic franchise revenues due to an increase in same store sales these increases were offset in part by lower companyowned store revenues resulting from the sale of 58 companyowned stores to multiple franchisees during fiscal 2011 and six companyowned stores in the first quarter of 2012 as well as the negative impact on international revenues of changes in foreign currency exchange rates 

income from operations increased 315 million or 112 in 2013 and increased 232 million or 89 in 2012 the increase in 2013 was driven primarily by higher royalty revenues from both domestic and international franchise stores higher domestic supply chain margins as described in more detail below and higher domestic companyowned store margins these increases were offset in part by higher general and administrative expenses and the negative impact of the changes in foreign currency exchange rates the increase in 2012 was driven primarily by higher royalty revenues from both domestic and international franchise stores higher domestic companyowned store margins and higher domestic supply chain margins as described in more detail below these increases were offset in part by the negative impact of the changes in foreign currency exchange rates and higher general and administrative expenses 

 

net income increased 306 million or 272 in 2013 and increased 70 million or 67 in 2012 the increase in 2013 was due primarily to domestic and international same store sales growth global store growth higher domestic supply chain margins higher domestic companyowned store margins and a lower effective tax rate and was negatively impacted by higher general and administrative expenses and changes in foreign currency exchange rates the increase in net income in 2012 was due primarily to domestic and international same store sales growth global store growth higher domestic companyowned store margins and higher domestic supply chain margins and was negatively impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates and higher general and administrative expenses additionally fiscal 2012 was negatively impacted by approximately 105 million of net pretax expenses incurred in connection with the company’s recapitalization 

we operate with significant levels of debt as of december 29 2013 consolidated debt was 154 billion historically a large portion of our cash flows from operations has been used to make principal and interest payments on our indebtedness as well as distributions to shareholders in the form of dividends and stock repurchases our securitized debt requires principal and interest payments until the expected repayment date of january 2019 the scheduled principal amortization payments are 236 million in 2014 295 million in 2015 374 million in 2016 394 million in each of 2017 and 2018 and 98 million in 2019 during fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2012 the company made principal payments of approximately 236 million and approximately 177 million overall we believe that our ability to consistently produce significant excess cash flows allows us the flexibility not only to service our debt but also to invest in our growing business as well as return cash to our shareholders 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america the preparation of these financial statements requires our management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis our management evaluates its estimates including those related to revenue recognition allowances for uncollectible receivables longlived and intangible assets insurance and legal matters sharebased payments and income taxes we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from those estimates changes in our accounting policies and estimates could materially impact our results of operations and financial condition for any particular period we believe that our most critical accounting policies and estimates are 

revenue recognition  we earn revenues through our network of domestic companyowned and franchise stores dough manufacturing and supply chain centers and international operations retail sales from companyowned stores and royalty revenues resulting from the retail sales from franchise stores are recognized as revenues when the items are delivered to or carried out by customers retail sales are generally reported and related royalties paid to the company on a weekly basis based on a percentage of retail sales as specified in the related standard franchise agreement generally 55 of domestic franchise retail sales in the event that retail sales are not reported timely by a franchisee the company will record royalty revenues in the period earned based on an estimate of the franchisee’s sales however these estimates are not significant and have historically been materially consistent with the actual amounts revenues from companyowned stores and royalty revenues from franchise stores fluctuate from timetotime as a result of store count changes for example if a companyowned store that generated 500000 in revenue in fiscal 2012 is sold to a franchisee in fiscal 2013 revenues from companyowned stores would have declined by 500000 in fiscal 2013 while franchise royalty revenues would have increased by only 27500 in fiscal 2013 as we generally collect 55 of a domestic franchisee’s retail sales sales of food from our supply chain centers are recognized as revenues upon delivery of the food to franchisees while sales of equipment and supplies are generally recognized as revenues upon shipment of the related products to franchisees 

allowances for uncollectible receivables we closely monitor our accounts and notes receivable balances and provide allowances for uncollectible amounts as a result of our reviews these estimates are based on among other factors historical collection experience and a review of our receivables by aging category additionally we may also provide allowances for uncollectible receivables based on specific customer collection issues that we have identified while writeoffs of bad debts have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established management cannot guarantee that future writeoffs will not exceed historical rates specifically if the financial condition of our franchisees were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments additional allowances may be required 

 

at december 29 2013 our total allowance for uncollectible accounts receivables was approximately 51 million compared to 59 million at december 30 2012 representing approximately 46 and 59 of our consolidated gross accounts receivable at both those respective yearends a 10 change in our allowance for uncollectible accounts receivables at december 29 2013 would result in a change in reserves of approximately 05 million and a change in income before provision for income taxes by the same amount currently management does not believe that there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions that were used to calculate our allowance for uncollectible accounts receivables 

longlived and intangible assets we record longlived assets including property plant and equipment and capitalized software at cost for acquisitions of franchise operations we estimate the fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired based on physical inspection of assets historical experience and other information available to us regarding the acquisition we depreciate and amortize longlived assets using useful lives determined by us based on historical experience and other information available to us we evaluate the potential impairment of longlived assets at least annually based on various analyses including the projection of undiscounted cash flows and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable for companyowned stores we perform related impairment tests on an operating market basis which the company has determined to be the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of other cash flows if the carrying amount of a longlived asset exceeds the amount of the expected future undiscounted cash flows of that asset or the estimated fair value of the asset an impairment loss is recognized and the asset is written down to its estimated fair value 

we have not made any significant changes in the methodology used to project the future market cash flows of companyowned stores during the years presented same store sales fluctuations and the rates at which operating costs will fluctuate in the future are key factors in evaluating recoverability of the related assets if our same store sales significantly decline or if operating costs increase and we are unable to recover these costs the carrying value of our companyowned stores by market may be unrecoverable and we may be required to recognize an impairment charge at december 29 2013 we determined that our longlived assets were not impaired 

a significant portion of our goodwill relates to acquisitions of domestic franchise stores and is included in our domestic stores segment specifically our companyowned stores we evaluate goodwill annually for impairment by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit which is primarily determined using the present value of historical cash flows to its carrying value if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value goodwill would be impaired we have not made any significant changes in the methodology used to evaluate goodwill impairment during the years presented at december 29 2013 the fair value of our business operations with associated goodwill exceeded their recorded carrying value including the related goodwill if cash flows generated by our companyowned stores were to decline significantly in the future or there were negative revisions to the market multiple assumption we may be required to recognize a goodwill impairment charge however based on the latest impairment analysis we do not believe it is reasonably likely that there could be changes in assumptions that would trigger impairment 

insurance and legal matters we are a party to lawsuits and legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business management closely monitors these legal matters and estimates the probable costs for the resolution of such matters these estimates are primarily determined by consulting with both internal and external parties handling the matters and are based upon an analysis of potential results assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies while historically our actual losses have been materially consistent with our reserves legal judgments can be volatile and difficult to predict accordingly if our estimates relating to legal matters proved inaccurate for any reason we may be required to increase or decrease the related expense in future periods we had accruals for legal matters of approximately 50 million at both december 30 2012 and december 29 2013 

for certain periods prior to december 1998 and for periods after december 2001 we maintain insurance coverage for workers’ compensation general liability and owned and nonowned auto liability under insurance policies requiring payment of a deductible for each occurrence up to between 500000 and 30 million depending on the policy year and line of coverage the related insurance reserves are based on undiscounted independent actuarial estimates which are based on historical information along with assumptions about future events specifically various methods including analyses of historical trends and actuarial valuation methods are utilized to estimate the cost to settle reported claims and claims incurred but not yet reported the actuarial valuation methods develop estimates of the future ultimate claim costs based on the claims incurred as of the balance sheet date when estimating these liabilities several factors are considered including the severity duration and frequency of claims legal cost associated with claims healthcare trends and projected inflation over the past several years we have experienced improvements in frequency of claims however increasing severity of claims and medical costs has partially offset these trends 

 

our methodology for determining our exposure has remained consistent throughout the years presented management believes that the various assumptions developed and actuarial methods used to determine our selfinsurance reserves are reasonable and provide meaningful data that management uses to make its best estimate of our exposure to these risks while historically our actual losses have been materially consistent with our reserves changes in assumptions for such factors as medical costs and legal actions as well as changes in actual experience could cause our estimates to change in the near term which could result in an increase or decrease in the related expense in future periods a 10 change in our selfinsurance liability at december 29 2013 would have affected our income before provision for income taxes by approximately 39 million for fiscal 2013 we had accruals for insurance matters of approximately 372 million at december 30 2012 and 388 million at december 29 2013 

sharebased payments we recognize compensation expense related to our sharebased compensation arrangements over the requisite service period based on the grant date fair value of the awards the grant date fair value of each restricted stock and performancebased restricted stock award is equal to the market price of our stock on the date of grant the grant date fair value of each stock option award is estimated using a blackscholes option pricing model the pricing model requires assumptions including the expected life of the stock option the riskfree interest rate the expected dividend yield and expected volatility of our stock over the expected life which significantly impact the assumed fair value we are also required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and only recognize expense for those awards expected to vest we use historical data to determine these assumptions additionally our stock option restricted stock and performancebased restricted stock arrangements provide for accelerated vesting and the ability to exercise during the remainder of the tenyear stock option life upon the retirement of individuals holding the awards who have achieved specified service and age requirements management believes that the methods and various assumptions used to determine compensation expense related to these arrangements are reasonable but if the assumptions change significantly for future grants sharebased compensation expense will fluctuate in future years 

income taxes we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities and reserves for uncertain tax positions we measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using current enacted tax rates that will apply in the years in which we expect the temporary differences to be recovered or paid judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes and related reserves deferred tax assets and liabilities these include establishing a valuation allowance related to the ability to realize certain deferred tax assets if necessary during fiscal 2012 and in connection with the sale of its six remaining companyowned stores in a certain market to a franchisee the company recorded a deferred tax asset related to the capital loss that resulted from the writeoff of the tax basis goodwill associated with the market that was sold management believes it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized and provided a valuation allowance of approximately 09 million the valuation allowance was recorded as an increase to the provision for income taxes and increased the company’s effective tax rate in 2012 on an ongoing basis management will assess whether it remains more likely than not that the net deferred tax asset will be realized the company had no additional valuation allowances recorded for deferred tax assets as of december 29 2013 or december 30 2012 our accounting for deferred tax assets represents our best estimate of future events our net deferred tax assets assume that we will generate sufficient taxable income in specific tax jurisdictions based on our estimates and assumptions changes in our current estimates due to unanticipated events could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

the amounts relating to taxes recorded on the balance sheet including tax reserves also consider the ultimate resolution of revenue agent reviews based on estimates and assumptions we believe we have appropriately accounted for our uncertain tax positions however tax audits changes in tax laws and other unforeseen matters may result in us owing additional taxes we adjust our reserves for uncertain tax positions when facts and circumstances change or due to the passage of time for example the completion of a tax audit or the expiration of a statute of limitations or changes in penalty and interest reserves associated with uncertain tax positions management believes that our tax positions comply with applicable tax law and that we have adequately provided for these matters however to the extent the final tax outcome of these matters is different than our recorded amounts we may be required to adjust our tax reserves resulting in additional income tax expense or benefit in future periods

as of december 29 2013 we had negative working capital of 285 million excluding restricted cash and cash equivalents of 1255 million and including total unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of 144 million historically we have operated with minimal positive working capital or negative working capital primarily because our receivable collection periods and inventory turn rates are faster than the normal payment terms on our current liabilities we generally collect our receivables within three weeks from the date of the related sale and we generally experience 30 to 40 inventory turns per year in addition our sales are not typically seasonal which further limits our working capital requirements these factors coupled with the use of our ongoing cash flows from operations to service our debt obligations invest in our business pay dividends and repurchase our common stock reduce our working capital amounts as of december 29 2013 we had approximately 513 million of restricted cash held for future principal and interest payments 420 million of cash held as collateral for outstanding letters of credit 210 million of restricted cash held in a three month interest reserve as required by the related debt agreements 111 million of cash related to the company’s third quarter 2013 dividend payment to shareholders and 01 million of other restricted cash for a total of 1255 million of restricted cash and cash equivalents

the notes are subject to certain financial and nonfinancial covenants including a debt service coverage calculation as defined in the related agreements in the event that certain covenants are not met the notes may become due and payable on an accelerated schedule 

we used a portion of the proceeds from the 2012 recapitalization to repay approximately 1447 billion in outstanding principal under the 2007 notes the proceeds were also used to pay accrued interest on the 2007 notes and transactionrelated fees and expenses incurred in connection with the 2012 recapitalization and to fund a reserve account for the payment of interest on the notes 

 

on march 16 2012 our board of directors declared a 300 per share special cash dividend on the outstanding common stock totaling 1711 million which was paid on april 2 2012 to stockholders of record at the close of business on march 26 2012 additionally pursuant to the antidilution provisions in our underlying stock option plans on april 2 2012 we made a corresponding cash payment of approximately 135 million on certain stock options reduced the exercise price on certain other stock options by an equivalent per share amount and in certain circumstances both reduced the stock option exercise price and made a cash payment totaling 300 per share on april 2 2012 we also accrued an estimated 24 million for payments to be made as certain performancebased restricted stock grants vest the dividend and related dividend equivalent payments were funded with the remaining proceeds from the 2012 recapitalization and cash on hand these antidilution payments were accounted for as modificationssettlements and were recorded as increases in total stockholders’ deficit as of december 30 2012 total cash paid for common stock dividends and related antidilution equivalent payments was approximately 1855 million and the total estimated liability recorded for future cash dividend payments on certain performancebased restricted stock was approximately 15 million as of december 29 2013 the total estimated liability recorded for future cash dividend payments on certain performancebased restricted stock was approximately 08 million 

during fiscal 2012 and in connection with the 2012 recapitalization we incurred approximately 105 million of net expenses additionally in connection with the 2012 recapitalization we recorded an additional 325 million of deferred financing costs as an asset in the consolidated balance sheet during fiscal 2012 this amount in addition to the 74 million recorded on the consolidated balance sheet at january 1 2012 is being amortized into interest expense over the sevenyear expected term of the debt 

as of december 29 2013 we had approximately 154 billion of total debt of which 241 million was classified as a current liability additionally as of december 29 2013 we had 423 million of outstanding letters of credit and 577 million of available borrowing capacity under our 1000 million variable funding notes the letters of credit are primarily related to our casualty insurance programs and supply chain center leases the company has collateralized these letters of credit with 420 million of restricted cash to reduce its fees on the variable funding notes and has the ability to access this cash with minimal notice borrowings under the variable funding notes are available to fund our working capital requirements capital expenditures and subject to other limitations other general corporate purposes including dividend payments our primary source of liquidity is cash flows from operations and availability of borrowings under our variable funding notes 

the company has a board of directors approved open market share repurchase program of the company’s common stock which was reset during the third quarter of 2012 at 2000 million the open market share repurchase program has historically been funded by excess cash flows and borrowings available under the variable funding notes the company used cash of approximately 882 million and 971 million in 2012 and 2013 respectively for share repurchases under this program the company had approximately 552 million left under the 2000 million authorization as of december 29 2013 on february 12 2014 the board of directors approved an increase to the company’s open market share repurchase program resulting in a total remaining authorized amount for additional share repurchases of 2000 million we expect to continue to use ongoing excess cash flow generation and subject to certain restrictions in the documents governing the variable funding notes availability under the variable funding notes to among other things repurchase shares under the current authorized program 

during fiscal 2013 we experienced increases in both domestic and international same store sales versus fiscal 2012 additionally our international business continued to grow stores at a record pace in fiscal 2013 these factors have contributed to our continued ability to generate positive operating cash flows we expect to use our unrestricted cash and cash equivalents our restricted cash amounts pledged as collateral for letters of credit ongoing cash flows from operations and available borrowings under the variable funding notes to among other things fund working capital requirements invest in our core business pay dividends and repurchase our common stock we have historically funded our working capital requirements capital expenditures debt repayments dividend payments and repurchases of common stock primarily from our cash flows from operations and when necessary our available borrowings under variable funding note facilities management believes its current unrestricted cash and cash equivalents balance its restricted cash amounts pledged as collateral for letters of credit and its expected ongoing cash flows from operations will be sufficient to fund operations for the foreseeable future 

in the past three years we have incurred annual capital expenditures of between 243 million to 404 million in 2013 we invested 404 million in capital expenditures which primarily related to investments in existing companyowned stores supply chain centers and training facilities as well as investments in our proprietary internally developed pointofsale system domino’s pulse™ our digital ordering platform and other technology initiatives which we believe are necessary to sustain and grow our business we expect to continue this level of capital expenditure in the future as we see continuing opportunities to invest in our industry leading technology platform the reimaging of our corporate stores and other initiatives to grow our brand we did not have any material commitments for capital expenditures as of december 29 2013 

 

cash provided by operating activities was 1940 million in 2013 1763 million in 2012 and 1531 million in 2011 the 177 million increase in 2013 versus 2012 was due primarily to a 263 million increase in net income excluding noncash adjustments offset by an 86 million net change in operating assets and liabilities resulting from the timing of payments on current operating liabilities and the timing of accounts receivable the 232 million increase in 2012 versus 2011 was due primarily to a 151 million increase in net income excluding noncash adjustments and an 81 million net change in operating assets and liabilities due primarily to the timing of payments on current operating liabilities and the timing of prepaid expenses we are focused on continually improving our net income and cash flow from operations as noted above we generated 1940 million of cash from our operating activities in 2013 even after deducting our 404 million of capital expenditures we generated a substantial amount of excess cash in 2013 some of which was deployed on other activities including but not limited to dividend payments and repurchases of our common stock management expects to continue to generate positive cash flows from operating activities for the foreseeable future 

cash used in investing activities was 997 million in 2013 cash provided by investing activities was 73 million in 2012 and cash used in investing activities was 269 million in 2011 the 1071 million net change in 2013 versus 2012 was due primarily to a 980 million increase in restricted cash and cash equivalents and an 111 million increase in capital expenditures due to increased investments in companyowned stores and supply chain centers as well as investments in our technology initiatives the 342 million net change in 2012 versus 2011 was due primarily to a 397 million decrease in restricted cash and cash equivalents due to the company eliminating cash pledged as collateral on its letters of credit in connection with the 2012 recapitalization these letters of credit now reduce the amount of borrowing available under the company’s variable funding notes this was offset in part by a 49 million increase in capital expenditures during 2012 as a result of increased investments in existing companyowned stores and supply chain centers as well as investments in our technology initiatives 

cash used in financing activities was 1348 million in 2013 1774 million in 2012 and 1235 million in 2011 the 426 million decrease in 2013 versus 2012 was due primarily to a 14 billion decrease in repayments of longterm debt a 1512 million decrease in common stock dividends and equivalent payments and a 325 million decrease in cash paid for financing costs offset by a 16 billion decrease of proceeds from issuance of the 2012 debt facility these changes were due primarily to our 2012 recapitalization the 539 million increase in 2012 versus 2011 was due primarily to 14 billion of repayments of the 2007 debt facilities 1855 million of dividend and equivalent payments a 288 million increase in cash paid for financing costs all of which resulted from our 2012 recapitalization and a 246 million decrease in proceeds from the exercise of stock options these uses of cash for financing activities were offset in part by 16 billion of proceeds from issuance of the 2012 fixed rate notes and a 768 million decrease in purchases of common stock 

based upon the current level of operations and anticipated growth we believe that the cash generated from operations our current unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and amounts available under the variable funding notes will be more than adequate to meet our anticipated debt service requirements capital expenditures dividend payments and working capital needs for the foreseeable future our ability to continue to fund these items and continue to reduce debt could be adversely affected by the occurrence of any of the events described in item 1a risk factors there can be no assurance however that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operations or that future borrowings will be available under the variable funding notes or otherwise to enable us to service our indebtedness or to make anticipated capital expenditures our future operating performance and our ability to service extend or refinance the fixed rate notes and to service extend or refinance the variable funding notes will be subject to future economic conditions and to financial business and other factors many of which are beyond our control 

impact of inflation 

we believe that our results of operations are not materially impacted by moderate changes in the inflation rate inflation did not have a material impact on our operations in 2011 2012 or 2013 severe increases in inflation however could affect the global and us economies and could have an adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations further discussion on the impact of commodities and other cost pressures is included above as well as in item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend market risk 

we do not engage in speculative transactions nor do we hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes in connection with the recapitalization in 2012 we issued fixed rate notes and at december 29 2013 we are only exposed to interest rate risk on borrowings under our variable funding notes as of december 29 2013 we had no outstanding borrowings under our variable funding notes our fixed rate debt exposes the company to changes in market interest rates reflected in the fair value of the debt and to the risk that the company may need to refinance maturing debt with new debt at a higher rate 

we are exposed to market risks from changes in commodity prices during the normal course of business we purchase cheese and certain other food products that are affected by changes in commodity prices and as a result we are subject to volatility in our food costs we may periodically enter into financial instruments to manage this risk we do not engage in speculative transactions nor do we hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes in instances when we use fixed pricing agreements with our suppliers these agreements cover our physical commodity needs are not netsettled and are accounted for as normal purchases 

from time to time we have entered into interest rate swaps collars or similar instruments with the objective of managing volatility relating to our borrowing costs we had no outstanding derivative instruments as of december 30 2012 or december 29 2013 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

we have exposure to various foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations for revenues generated by our operations outside the united states which can adversely impact our net income and cash flows total revenues of approximately 122 in 2011 130 in 2012 and 135 in 2013 were derived from sales to customers and royalties from franchisees outside the contiguous united states this business is conducted in the local currency but royalty payments are generally remitted to us in us dollars we do not enter into financial instruments to manage this foreign currency exchange risk a hypothetical 10 adverse change in the foreign currency rates in each of our top ten international markets based on store count would have resulted in a negative impact on revenues of approximately 97 million in 2013

we participate primarily in two segments of this industry the delivery and carryout segments during the period from 2002 to 2012 the delivery segment declined from 110 billion to 96 billion however the delivery segment has been relatively flat over the past three years going from 97 billion in 2010 to 96 billion in 2012 its 96 billion of sales accounted for approximately 30 of total us qsr pizza category sales in the twelve months ended november 2012 we and our top two competitors account for approximately 53 of us pizza delivery based on reported consumer spending with the remaining 47 attributable to regional chains and individual establishments from 2002 to 2012 the carryout segment grew from 116 billion to 146 billion additionally in the past three years the carryout segment grew from 141 billion in 2010 to 146 billion for the twelve months ended 2012 we are the market share leader in the delivery segment and the second largest in carryout a segment we have been focused on growing given our strong brand convenient store locations and quality affordable menu offerings 

in contrast to the united states international pizza delivery is relatively underdeveloped with only domino’s and one other competitor having a significant global presence we believe that demand for international pizza and pizza delivery is large and growing driven by international consumers’ increasing emphasis on convenience and the proven success of our 29 years of conducting business abroad 

our competitive strengths 

we believe that our competitive strengths include the following 

 

   

  

 in addition we generally share 50 or a higher percentage in the case of companyowned stores and certain franchisees who operate a larger number of stores of the pretax profits generated by our regional dough manufacturing and supply chain centers with those domestic franchisees who agree to purchase all of their food from our supply chain system these arrangements strengthen our ties with our franchisees by enhancing their profitability while providing us with a continuing source of revenues and earnings this arrangement also provides incentives for franchisees to work closely with us to reduce costs we believe our strong mutuallybeneficial franchisee relationships are evidenced by the over 99 voluntary participation in our domestic supply chain system our approximately 99 domestic franchise contract renewal rate and our over 99 collection rate on domestic franchise royalty and domestic supply chain receivables 

internationally we have been able to grow our franchise network by attracting franchisees with business experience capital and local market knowledge we generally employ our master franchise model which provides our international franchisees with exclusive rights to operate stores and subfranchise our wellrecognized domino’s pizza ® brand name in specific agreedupon market areas as well as operate their own supply chain systems from yearend 2007 through 2012 we grew our international franchise network 54 from 3469 stores to 5327 stores our largest master franchisee operates 911 stores in five markets which accounts for approximately 17 of our total international store count and nearly 9 of our global store count during 2012 we had 492 net international store openings including 113 net stores in india 64 net stores in turkey and 50 net stores in the united kingdom 

 

 we believe that our store economics have led to a strong welldiversified franchise system this established franchise system has produced strong cash flow and earnings for us which has enabled us to invest in the domino’s pizza ® brand our stores our technology and our supply chain centers pay significant dividends repurchase shares of our common stock repurchase and retire outstanding principal on our fixed rate notes and deliver attractive returns to our stockholders 

 

 outside the united states we have significant market share positions in the key markets in which we compete including the united kingdom mexico india australia south korea canada turkey japan france and taiwan these top ten international markets based on store count accounted for approximately 79 of our international retail sales in 2012 we believe we have a strong presence in each of these markets 

  

 we believe that our brand is particularly strong among pizza consumers for whom a meal is a fairly spontaneous event in these situations we believe that service and product quality are the consumers’ priorities we believe that well established demographic and lifestyle trends will drive continuing emphasis on convenience and will therefore continue to play into our brand’s strength 

 

 in 2012 we made approximately 511000 fullservice food deliveries to our domestic stores or approximately two deliveries per store per week with an ontime delivery performance rate of approximately 94 all of our companyowned stores and over 99 of our domestic franchise stores purchase all of their food and supplies from us this is accomplished through our network of 16 regional dough manufacturing and supply chain centers each of which is generally located within a oneday delivery radius of the stores it serves and a leased fleet of over 400 tractors and trailers additionally we supply certain of our domestic and international franchisees with equipment and supplies through our equipment and supply center which we operate as part of our domestic supply chain segment offering a full range of nonfood products from ovens to uniforms we also supply certain of our domestic stores with ingredients that are processed at our vegetable processing center and thin crust product that is manufactured at our thin crust manufacturing center both of which we operate as part of our domestic supply chain segment 

because we source the food for substantially all of our domestic stores our domestic supply chain segment enables us to leverage and monitor our strong supplier relationships to achieve the cost benefits of scale and to ensure compliance with our rigorous quality standards in addition the “onestop shop” nature of this system combined with our delivery accuracy allows our store managers to eliminate a significant component of the typical “backofstore” activity that many of our competitors’ store managers must undertake additionally we operate six supply chain centers that service certain of our international franchise markets 

our business strategy 

we intend to achieve further growth and strengthen our competitive position through the continued implementation of our business strategy which includes the following key elements 

 

  

  

  

  

 we adhere to the following guiding principles which are based on the concept of one united brand system and team 

 

  

  

  

  

   

 the carryout component had 146 billion of sales in the twelve months ended november 2012 while our primary focus is on pizza delivery we are also favorably positioned as a leader in the growing carryout component given our strong brand store locations and quality affordable menu offerings 

 

 in 2009 domestic stores contributed 5 of their retail sales to support national advertising also in 2009 all domestic franchisees amended their standard franchise agreements to require a contribution of 55 subject in limited instances to lower rates based on certain incentives and waivers of their retail sales for national advertising and to eliminate the required marketlevel contributions this 55 contribution rate which took effect in 2010 continued throughout 2011 and 2012 in january 2013 with the support of the domestic franchise system domestic franchisees amended their standard franchise agreements to require a contribution of 6 subject in limited instances to lower rates based on certain incentives and waivers of their retail sales for national advertising we currently anticipate that this 6 contribution rate which took effect in 2013 will remain in place for the foreseeable future 

we intend to leverage our strong brand by continuing to introduce innovative consumertested and profitable new product varieties such as handmade pan pizza artisan pizzas oven baked sandwiches domino’s american legends ® pizzas and breadbowl pasta™ complementary side items such as our parmesan bread bites stuffed cheesy bread boneless chicken and wings cinna stix ® and chocolate lava crunch cakes and value promotions as well as through marketing affiliations with brands such as cocacola ®  additionally we may from timetotime partner with other organizations in an effort to promote the domino’s pizza ® brand we believe these opportunities when coupled with our scale and share leadership will allow us to grow our position in both us pizza delivery and carryout 

 

 we believe that pizza has global appeal and that there is strong and growing international demand for delivered pizza we have successfully built a broad international platform primarily through our master franchise model as evidenced by our 5327 international stores in more than 70 international markets we believe that we continue to have significant longterm growth opportunities in international markets where we have established a leading presence in our top ten international markets we believe that our current store base is approximately half of the total longterm potential store base in those markets generally we believe we will achieve longterm growth internationally as a result of the favorable storelevel economics of our business model the growing international demand for pizza and delivered pizza and the strong global recognition of the domino’s pizza ® brand our international stores have produced positive quarterly same store sales growth for 76 consecutive quarters additionally during 2012 we had 492 net international store openings including 113 net stores in india 64 net stores in turkey and 50 net stores in the united kingdom 

  

store operations 

we believe that our focused and proven store model provides a significant competitive advantage relative to many of our competitors who focus on multiple components of the pizza category particularly dinein we have been focused primarily on pizza delivery for over 50 years our domestic stores generally do not offer dinein additionally certain of our international stores offer casual seating but do not offer fullservice dinein areas therefore our domestic and international stores do not require expensive restaurant facilities and staffing our stores also benefit from lower maintenance costs as store assets have long lives and updates are not frequently required our simple and efficient operational processes which we have refined through continuous improvement include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 strategic store locations to facilitate delivery and carryout service 

we locate our stores strategically to facilitate timely delivery and carryout service to our customers the majority of our domestic stores are located in populated areas in or adjacent to large or midsize cities or on or near college campuses we use geographic information software which incorporates variables such as traffic volumes competitor locations household demographics and visibility to evaluate and identify potential store locations and new markets 

productionoriented store designs 

our typical store is relatively small occupying on average approximately 1500 square feet and is designed with a focus on efficient and timely production of consistently high quality food for delivery and carryout the store layout has been refined over time to provide an efficient flow from ordertaking to delivery or carryout our stores are primarily production facilities and accordingly do not have a fullservice dinein area 

product and process innovations 

our over 50 years of experience and innovative culture have resulted in numerous new product and process developments that increase both quality and efficiency these include our efficient verticallyintegrated supply chain system a sturdier corrugated pizza box and a mesh screen that helped cook pizza crust more evenly the domino’s heatwave ® hot bag keeps our pizzas hot during delivery we also continue to introduce new products such as domino’s american legends ® pizzas and domino’s breadbowl pasta™ both launched in 2009 improved new boneless chicken and wings domino’s artisan pizzas and stuffed cheesy bread each launched in 2011 and parmesan bread bites and our new handmade pan pizza both launched in 2012 additionally we have added a number of complementary side items to our menu such as bread sticks cinna stix ® and chocolate lava crunch cakes in 2009 we introduced our improved pizza recipe which was a change to our core pizza recipe 

focused menu 

we maintain a focused menu that is designed to present an attractive quality offering to customers while minimizing order errors and expediting the order taking and food preparation processes our basic menu has three choices for pizza products pizza type pizza size and pizza toppings most of our stores carry two or three sizes of traditional handtossed brooklyn style and crunchy thin crust pizza our typical store also offers domino’s handmade pan pizza domino’s artisan pizzas domino’s american legends ® pizzas domino’s oven baked sandwiches domino’s bread bowl pasta™ boneless chicken and wings bread sticks cinna stix ®  chocolate lava crunch cakes stuffed cheesy bread parmesan bread bites and cocacola ® soft drink products we also occasionally offer other products on a promotional or a regional basis such as salads we believe that our focused menu creates a strong identity among consumers improves operating efficiency and maintains food quality and consistency 

  

efficient order taking production and delivery 

each store executes an operational process that includes order taking pizza preparation cooking via automated conveyordriven ovens boxing and delivery the entire order taking and pizza production process is designed for completion in approximately 1215 minutes these operational processes are supplemented by an extensive employee training program designed to ensure worldclass quality and customer service it is our priority to ensure that every domino’s store operates in an efficient consistent manner while maintaining our high standards of food quality and team member safety 

domino’s pulse™ pointofsale system with stateoftheart digital ordering capabilities 

our computerized management information systems are designed to improve operating efficiencies provide corporate management with timely access to financial and marketing data and reduce store and corporate administrative time and expense we have installed domino’s pulse™ our proprietary pointofsale system in every companyowned store in the united states in more than 99 of our domestic franchise stores and in over 50 of the international stores domino’s pulse™ features include 

 

  

  

  

 we require our domestic franchisees to install and maintain domino’s pulse™ additionally domino’s pulse ™ has been installed in over 2700 international franchise stores management believes that utilizing domino’s pulse™ throughout our domestic system and a growing portion of our global system provides us with competitive advantages over other pointofsales systems including 

 

  

  

  

  

 since the rollout of domino’s pulse ™ to our domestic stores our online ordering transactions have grown currently on average approximately onethird of our domestic stores’ sales originate online in 2010 we made the strategic decision to develop our own online ordering platform and manage this important and growing area of our business internally in 2011 we launched a new mobile application for the iphone and ipod touch to provide further convenience for our customers when ordering online in 2012 we launched a new mobile application for the android smartphone and for amazon’s kindle fire and we also launched a new spanishlanguage ordering mobile application for smartphones we intend to continue to enhance and grow our online ordering capabilities 

comprehensive store operations evaluation program 

we utilize a comprehensive evaluation program to ensure that our stores are meeting both our stringent standards as well as the expectations of our customers the program focuses primarily on the quality of the pizza the store is producing the customer service the store is providing and the condition of the store as viewed by the customer we believe that this program is an integral part of our strategy to maintain high standards in our stores 

segment overview 

we operate in three business segments 

 

  

  

   

domestic stores 

during 2012 our domestic stores segment accounted for 5187 million or nearly 31 of our consolidated revenues our domestic franchises are operated by entrepreneurs who own and operate an average of four stores nine of our domestic franchisees operate more than 50 stores including our largest domestic franchisee who operates 135 stores our principal sources of revenues from domestic store operations are companyowned store sales and royalty payments based on retail sales by our franchisees our domestic network of companyowned stores also plays an important strategic role in our predominantly franchised operating structure in addition to generating revenues and earnings we use our domestic companyowned stores as test sites for new products and promotions as well as store operational improvements and as forums for training new store managers and prospective franchisees we also believe that our domestic companyowned stores add to the economies of scale available for advertising marketing and other costs that are primarily borne by our franchisees while we continue to be primarily a franchised business we continually evaluate our mix of domestic companyowned and franchise stores in an effort to optimize our longterm profitability 

our domestic companyowned store operations are divided into eight geographic areas located throughout the contiguous united states while our domestic franchise operations are divided into four regions our team members within these areas provide direct supervision over our domestic companyowned stores provide training store operational audits and marketing services and provide financial analysis and store development services to our franchisees we maintain a close relationship with our franchise stores through regional franchise teams an array of computerbased training materials that help franchise stores comply with our standards and franchise advisory groups that facilitate communications between us and our franchisees 

domestic supply chain 

during 2012 our domestic supply chain segment accounted for 9422 million or 56 of our consolidated revenues our domestic supply chain segment is comprised primarily of 16 regional dough manufacturing and supply chain centers that manufacture fresh dough on a daily basis and purchase receive store and deliver quality pizzarelated food products and other complementary items to all of our companyowned stores and over 99 of our domestic franchise stores on average each regional dough manufacturing and supply chain center serves approximately 300 stores generally located within a oneday delivery radius we regularly supply nearly 5000 stores with various supplies and ingredients of which nine product groups account for over 90 of the volume our domestic supply chain segment made approximately 511000 fullservice deliveries in 2012 or approximately two deliveries per store per week and we produced over 314 million pounds of dough during 2012 

we believe that our franchisees voluntarily choose to obtain food supplies and equipment from us because we offer the most efficient convenient and costeffective alternative while also offering both quality and consistency in addition our domestic supply chain segment offers a profitsharing arrangement to franchisees that purchase all of their food for their stores from our domestic dough manufacturing and supply chain centers this profitsharing arrangement generally offers domestic companyowned stores and participating franchisees with 50 or a higher percentage in the case of companyowned stores and certain franchisees who operate a larger number of stores of their regional supply chain center’s pretax profits profits are shared with the franchisees based upon each franchisee’s purchases from our supply chain centers we believe these arrangements strengthen our ties with these franchisees 

the information systems used by our domestic dough manufacturing and supply chain centers are an integral part of the quality service we provide our stores we use routing strategies and software to optimize our daily delivery schedules which maximizes ontime deliveries through our strategically located dough manufacturing and supply chain center locations and proven routing systems we achieved an ontime delivery performance rate of approximately 94 during 2012 our supply chain center drivers unload food and supplies and stock store shelves typically during nonpeak store hours which minimize disruptions in store operations 

international 

during 2012 our international segment accounted for 2176 million or 13 of our consolidated revenues at december 30 2012 we had 5327 international franchise stores the principal sources of revenues from our international operations are royalty payments generated by retail sales from franchise stores and sales of food and supplies to franchisees in certain markets 

  

we have grown by more than 1800 international stores over the past five years during 2012 we had 492 net international store openings including 113 net stores in india 64 net stores in turkey and 50 net stores in the united kingdom our international franchisees adapt our standard operating model within certain parameters to satisfy the local eating habits and consumer preferences of various regions outside the united states currently most of our international stores are operated under master franchise agreements and we plan to continue entering into master franchise agreements with qualified franchisees to expand our international operations in selected markets we believe that our international franchise stores appeal to potential franchisees because of our wellrecognized brand name the limited capital expenditures required to open and operate our stores and our system’s favorable store economics while we had a significant presence in our top ten international markets we believe that these markets contain opportunities for additional growth of the domino’s pizza ® brand currently our master franchise companies based in australia india mexico and the united kingdom are publicly traded entities in their respective country the following table shows our store count as of december 30 2012 in our top ten international markets which account for approximately 74 of our international stores 

 

 domestic franchise program 

as of december 30 2012 our 4540 domestic franchise stores were owned and operated by our 1026 domestic franchisees the success of our franchise formula which enables franchisees to benefit from our brand name with a relatively low initial capital investment has attracted a large number of motivated entrepreneurs as franchisees as of december 30 2012 the average domestic franchisee owned and operated four stores and had been in our franchise system for nearly fifteen years at the same time nine of our domestic franchisees operated more than 50 stores including our largest domestic franchisee who operates 135 stores 

franchisees 

we apply rigorous standards to prospective franchisees we generally require prospective domestic franchisees to manage a store for at least one year before being granted a franchise this enables us to observe the operational and financial performance of a potential franchisee prior to entering into a longterm contract we also generally restrict the ability of domestic franchisees to be involved in other businesses which focuses our franchisees’ attention on operating their stores as a result the vast majority of our domestic franchisees have historically come from within the domino’s pizza system we believe these standards are largely unique to the franchise industry and result in qualified and focused franchisees operating their stores 

franchise agreements 

we enter into franchise agreements with domestic franchisees under which the franchisee is granted the right to operate a store in a particular location for a term of ten years with options to renew for an additional term of ten years we currently have a franchise contract renewal rate of approximately 99 under the current standard franchise agreement we assign an exclusive area of primary responsibility to each franchise store during the term of the franchise agreement the franchisee is required to pay a 55 royalty fee on sales subject in limited instances to lower rates based on area development agreements sales initiatives and new store incentives we have the contractual right subject to state law to terminate a franchise agreement for a variety of reasons including but not limited to a franchisee’s failure to make required payments when due or failure to adhere to specified company policies and standards 

franchise store development 

we assist domestic franchisees with selecting store sites and conforming the space to the physical specifications required for a domino’s pizza store each domestic franchisee selects the location and design for each store subject to our approval based on accessibility and visibility of the site and demographic factors including population density and anticipated traffic levels we also sell fixtures and equipment to many of our franchise stores 

  

international franchise program 

franchisees 

the vast majority of our markets outside of the contiguous united states are operated by master franchisees with franchise and distribution rights for entire regions or countries in a few select markets we franchise directly to individual store operators prospective master franchisees are required to possess or have access to local market knowledge required to establish and develop domino’s pizza stores the local market knowledge focuses on the ability to identify and access targeted real estate sites along with expertise in local customs culture consumer behavior and laws we also seek candidates that have access to sufficient capital to meet growth and development plans 

master franchise agreements 

our master franchise agreements generally grant the franchisee exclusive rights to develop or subfranchise stores and the right to operate supply chain centers in a particular geographic area for a term of 10 to 20 years with options to renew for additional terms the agreements typically contain growth clauses requiring franchisees to open a minimum number of stores within a specified period the master franchisee is generally required to pay an initial onetime franchise fee as well as an additional franchise fee upon the opening of each new store in addition the master franchisee is required to pay a continuing royalty fee as a percentage of retail sales which varies among international markets and averaged approximately 30 in 2012 

franchise training and support 

training store managers and employees is a critical component of our success we require all domestic franchisees to complete initial and ongoing training programs provided by us in addition under the standard domestic franchise agreement domestic franchisees are required to implement training programs for their store employees we assist our domestic and international franchisees by making training materials available to them for their use in training store managers and employees including computerbased training materials comprehensive operations manuals and franchise development classes we also maintain communications with our franchisees online through various newsletters electronic communications and through facetoface meetings 

franchise operations 

we enforce stringent standards over franchise operations to protect the domino’s pizza ® brand all franchisees are required to operate their stores in compliance with written policies standards and specifications which include matters such as menu items ingredients materials supplies services furnishings decor and signs each franchisee has discretion to determine the prices to be charged to customers we also provide ongoing support to our franchisees including training marketing assistance and consultation to franchisees who experience financial or operational difficulties we have established several advisory boards through which franchisees contribute to developing systemwide initiatives 

marketing operations 

in our recent history depending on the fiscal year our domestic stores have contributed 4 or 5 of their retail sales to fund national marketing and advertising campaigns with additional required contributions to local marketlevel programs during 2009 all domestic franchisees amended their master franchise agreements to require a contribution of 55 subject in limited instances to lower rates based on certain incentives and waivers of their retail sales to fund national marketing and advertising campaigns and to eliminate the required marketlevel contributions this 55 contribution rate which began in 2010 continued in 2011 and 2012 in january 2013 with the support of the domestic franchise system domestic franchisees amended their standard franchise agreements to require a contribution of 6 subject in limited instances to lower rates based on certain incentives and waivers of their retail sales for national advertising we currently anticipate that this 6 contribution rate which took effect in 2013 will remain in place for the foreseeable future in those markets where we have cooperative advertising programs our domestic stores are still able to contribute to marketlevel media campaigns at their discretion these national and marketlevel funds are administered by domino’s national advertising fund inc or dnaf our notforprofit advertising subsidiary the funds remitted to dnaf are used primarily to purchase media for advertising but also support market research field communications public relations commercial production talent payments and other activities supporting the domino’s pizza ® brand dnaf also provides costeffective print resources to our domestic stores for use in local marketing that reinforce our national branding strategy in addition to the national and marketlevel advertising contributions domestic stores spend additional amounts on local store marketing including targeted database mailings saturation print mailings and community involvement through school and civic organizations additionally we may from timetotime partner with other organizations in an effort to promote the domino’s pizza ® brand 

  

by communicating a common brand message at the national local market and store levels we create and reinforce a powerful consistent marketing message to consumers this is evidenced by our successful marketing campaign with the slogan “oh yes we did” since introducing our improved pizza recipe and this new marketing campaign in the fourth quarter of 2009 we have received significant attention in the news media social networking internet sites and other media outlets and have experienced positive same store sales growth in our domestic stores additionally in may 2011 pizza today  the leading publication of the pizza industry named domino’s its “chain of the year” for the second straight year – making the company a threetime overall winner of the honor and the first pizza delivery company to receive the honor in backtoback years over the past five years we estimate that domestic stores have invested approximately 14 billion on national local and cooperative advertising in the united states 

internationally marketing efforts are the responsibility of the franchisee in each local market we assist international franchisees with their marketing efforts through marketing workshops and knowledge sharing of best practices and successful concepts 

thirdparty suppliers 

we have maintained active relationships of 20 years or more with more than half of our major thirdparty suppliers our thirdparty suppliers are required to meet strict quality standards to ensure food safety we review and evaluate our thirdparty suppliers’ quality assurance programs through among other actions onsite visits third party audits and product evaluations to ensure compliance with our standards we believe that the length and quality of our relationships with thirdparty suppliers provides us with priority service and quality products at competitive prices 

we believe that two factors have been critical to maintaining longlasting relationships and keeping our purchasing costs low first we are one of the largest domestic volume purchasers of pizzarelated products such as flour cheese sauce and pizza boxes which allows us to maximize leverage with our thirdparty suppliers when items are put out for bid on a scheduled basis second we use a combination of singlesource and multisource procurement strategies each supply category is evaluated along a number of criteria including value of purchasing leverage consistency of quality and reliability of supply to determine the appropriate number of thirdparty suppliers 

we currently purchase our pizza cheese from a single supplier under the arrangement with this supplier which was entered into in october 2012 the supplier agreed to provide an uninterrupted supply of cheese and the company agreed to a fiveyear pricing period during which it agreed to purchase all of its primary pizza cheese for the company’s domestic stores from this supplier or alternatively pay to the supplier an amount reflecting any benefit previously received by the company under the new pricing terms the pricing schedule is directly correlated to the chicago mercantile exchange cme block cheddar price the majority of our meat toppings come from a single supplier under a contract that began in november 2010 and expires in october 2013 we have the right to terminate these arrangements for quality failures and for uncured breaches 

we believe that alternative thirdparty suppliers for all of these ingredients are available and all of our pizza boxes sauces and other ingredients are sourced from various thirdparty suppliers while we may incur additional costs if we are required to replace any of our thirdparty suppliers we do not believe that such additional costs would have a material adverse effect on our business we also entered into a multiyear agreement with cocacola effective january 1 2003 for the contiguous united states the contract provides for cocacola to be our exclusive beverage supplier and expires at such time as a minimum number of cases of cocacola ® products are purchased by us we continually evaluate each supply category to determine the optimal sourcing strategy 

we have not experienced any significant shortages of supplies or any delays in receiving our food or beverage inventories restaurant supplies or products prices charged to us by our thirdparty suppliers are subject to fluctuation and we have historically been able to pass increased costs and savings on to our stores we periodically enter into supplier contracts and infrequently utilize financial instruments to manage the risk from changes in commodity prices we do not engage in speculative transactions nor do we hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes 

competition 

the us and international pizza delivery and carryout segments are highly competitive domestically we compete against regional and local companies as well as national chains pizza hut ®  papa john’s ® and little caesars pizza ®  internationally we compete primarily against pizza hut ® and countryspecific national and local companies we generally compete on the basis of product quality location image service and price we also compete on a broader scale with quick service and other international national regional and local restaurants in addition the overall food service industry and the qsr sector in particular are intensely competitive with respect to product quality price service convenience and concept the industry is often affected by changes in consumer tastes economic conditions demographic trends and consumers’ disposable income we compete within the food service industry and the qsr sector not only for customers but also for personnel suitable real estate sites and qualified franchisees 

  

government regulation 

we are subject to various federal state and local laws affecting the operation of our business as are our franchisees including various health sanitation fire and safety standards each store is subject to licensing and regulation by a number of governmental authorities which include zoning health safety sanitation building and fire agencies in the jurisdiction in which the store is located in connection with maintaining our stores we may be required to expend funds to meet certain federal state and local regulations including regulations requiring that remodeled or altered stores be accessible to persons with disabilities difficulties in obtaining or the failure to obtain required licenses or approvals could delay or prevent the opening of a new store in a particular area or cause an existing store to cease operations our supply chain facilities are also licensed and subject to similar regulations by federal state and local health and fire codes

internationally our franchise stores are subject to national and local laws and regulations that often are similar to those affecting our domestic stores including laws and regulations concerning franchises labor health sanitation and safety our international stores are also often subject to tariffs and regulations on imported commodities and equipment and laws regulating foreign investment we believe that our international disclosure statements franchise offering documents and franchising procedures comply in all material respects with the laws of the foreign countries in which we have offered franchises

 item 1a risk factors tableend the quick service restaurant pizza category is highly competitive and such competition could adversely affect our operating results 

we compete in the united states against three national chains as well as many regional and local businesses we could experience increased competition from existing or new companies in the pizza category which could create increasing pressures to grow our business in order to maintain our market share if we are unable to maintain our competitive position we could experience downward pressure on prices lower demand for our products reduced margins the inability to take advantage of new business opportunities and the loss of market share all of which would have an adverse effect on our operating results and could cause our stock price to decline 

we also compete on a broader scale with quick service and other international national regional and local restaurants the overall food service market and the quick service restaurant sector are intensely competitive with respect to food quality price service image convenience and concept and are often affected by changes in 

 

  

  

  

  

 we compete within the food service market and the quick service restaurant sector not only for customers but also for management and hourly employees suitable real estate sites and qualified franchisees our domestic supply chain segment is also subject to competition from outside suppliers while over 99 of domestic franchisees purchased food equipment and supplies from us in 2012 domestic franchisees are not required to purchase food equipment or supplies from us and they may choose to purchase from outside suppliers if other suppliers who meet our qualification standards were to offer lower prices or better service to our franchisees for their ingredients and supplies and as a result our franchisees chose not to purchase from our domestic supply chain centers our financial condition business and results of operations would be adversely affected 

if we fail to successfully implement our growth strategy which includes opening new domestic and international stores our ability to increase our revenues and operating profits could be adversely affected 

a significant component of our growth strategy includes the opening of new domestic and international stores we and our franchisees face many challenges in opening new stores including among others 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 the opening of additional franchise stores also depends in part upon the availability of prospective franchisees who meet our criteria our failure to add a significant number of new stores would adversely affect our ability to increase revenues and operating income 

  

we are currently planning to expand our international operations in many of the markets where we currently operate and in selected new markets this may require considerable management time as well as startup expenses for market development before any significant revenues and earnings are generated operations in new foreign markets may achieve low margins or may be unprofitable and expansion in existing markets may be affected by local economic and market conditions therefore as we expand internationally we or our franchisees may not experience the operating margins we expect our results of operations may be negatively impacted and our common stock price may decline 

we may also pursue strategic acquisitions as part of our business if we are able to identify acquisition candidates such acquisitions may be financed to the extent permitted under our debt agreements with substantial debt or with potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities 

the food service market is affected by consumer preferences and perceptions changes in these preferences and perceptions may lessen the demand for our products which would reduce sales and harm our business 

food service businesses are affected by changes in consumer tastes international national regional and local economic conditions and demographic trends for instance if prevailing health or dietary preferences cause consumers to avoid pizza and other products we offer in favor of foods that are perceived as more healthy our business and operating results would be harmed moreover because we are primarily dependent on a single product if consumer demand for pizza should decrease our business would suffer more than if we had a more diversified menu as many other food service businesses do 

reports of foodborne illness or food tampering could reduce sales and harm our business 

reports whether true or not of foodborne illnesses such as e coli avian flu bovine spongiform encephalopathy hepatitis a trichinosis or salmonella and injuries caused by food tampering have in the past severely injured the reputations of participants in the qsr sector and could in the future as well the potential for acts of terrorism on our nation’s food supply also exists and if such an event occurs it could have a negative impact on us and could severely hurt sales and profits in addition our reputation is an important asset as a result anything that damages our reputation could immediately and severely affect our sales and profits media reports of illnesses and injuries whether accurate or not could force some stores to close or otherwise reduce sales at such stores in addition reports of foodborne illnesses or food tampering even those occurring solely at the restaurants of competitors could by resulting in negative publicity about the restaurant industry adversely affect us on a local regional national or international basis 

increases in food labor and other costs could adversely affect our profitability and operating results 

an increase in our operating costs could adversely affect our profitability factors such as inflation increased food costs increased labor and employee health and benefit costs increased rent costs and increased energy costs may adversely affect our operating costs most of the factors affecting costs are beyond our control and in many cases we may not be able to pass along these increased costs to our customers or franchisees most ingredients used in our pizza particularly cheese are subject to significant price fluctuations as a result of seasonality weather demand and other factors the cheese block price per pound averaged 169 in 2012 and the estimated increase in companyowned store food costs from a hypothetical 025 adverse change in the average cheese block price per pound would have been approximately 20 million in 2012 labor costs are largely a function of the minimum wage for a majority of our store personnel and certain supply chain center personnel and generally are also a function of the availability of labor food including cheese costs and labor represent approximately 50 to 60 of a typical companyowned store’s sales 

we do not have longterm contracts with certain of our suppliers and as a result they could seek to significantly increase prices or fail to deliver 

we do not have written contracts or formal longterm arrangements with certain of our suppliers although in the past we have not experienced significant problems with our suppliers our suppliers may implement significant price increases or may not meet our requirements in a timely fashion or at all the occurrence of any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

shortages or interruptions in the supply or delivery of fresh food products could adversely affect our operating results 

we and our franchisees are dependent on frequent deliveries of fresh food products that meet our specifications shortages or interruptions in the supply of fresh food products caused by unanticipated demand problems in production or distribution financial or other difficulties of suppliers inclement weather or other conditions could adversely affect the availability quality and cost of ingredients which would adversely affect our operating results 

  

any prolonged disruption in the operations of any of our dough manufacturing and supply chain centers could harm our business 

we operate 16 regional dough manufacturing and supply chain centers one thin crust manufacturing center and one vegetable processing center in the contiguous united states and a total of six dough manufacturing and supply chain centers in alaska hawaii and canada our domestic dough manufacturing and supply chain centers service all of our companyowned stores and over 99 of our domestic franchise stores as a result any prolonged disruption in the operations of any of these facilities whether due to technical or labor difficulties destruction or damage to the facility real estate issues or other reasons could adversely affect our business and operating results 

our success depends in part upon effective advertising and lower advertising funds may reduce our ability to adequately market the domino’s pizza ® brand 

we have been routinely named a megabrand by advertising age each domino’s store located in the contiguous united states is obligated to pay a percentage of its sales in advertising fees in fiscal 2012 each store in the contiguous united states generally was required to contribute 55 of their sales to dnaf subject in limited instances to lower rates based on certain incentives and waivers which uses such fees for national advertising in addition to contributions for local marketlevel advertising in january 2013 with the support of the domestic franchise system domestic franchisees amended their standard franchise agreements to require a contribution of 6 subject in limited instances to lower rates based on certain incentives and waivers of their retail sales for national advertising we currently anticipate that this 6 contribution rate which took effect in 2013 will remain in place for the foreseeable future while additional funds for advertising in the past have been provided by us our franchisees and other third parties none of these additional funds are legally required the lack of continued financial support for advertising activities could significantly curtail our marketing efforts which may in turn materially and adversely affect our business and our operating results 

we face risks of litigation and negative publicity from customers franchisees suppliers employees and others in the ordinary course of business which can or could divert our financial and management resources any adverse litigation or publicity may negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations 

claims of illness or injury relating to food quality or food handling are common in the food service industry and vehicular accidents and injuries occur in the food delivery business claims within our industry of improper supplier actions have also recently arisen that if made against one of our suppliers could potentially damage our brand image in addition class action lawsuits have been filed and may continue to be filed against various quick service restaurants alleging among other things that quick service restaurants have failed to disclose the health risks associated with highfat foods and that quick service restaurant marketing practices have encouraged obesity in addition to decreasing our sales and profitability and diverting our management resources adverse publicity or a substantial judgment against us could negatively impact our financial condition results of operations and brand reputation thereby hindering our ability to attract and retain franchisees and grow our business 

further we may be subject to employee franchisee and other claims in the future based on among other things discrimination harassment wrongful termination and wage rest break and meal break issues and those claims relating to overtime compensation we have been subject to these types of claims in the past if one or more of these claims were to be successful or if there is a significant increase in the number of these claims or if we receive significant negative publicity our business financial condition and operating results could be harmed 

loss of key personnel or our inability to attract and retain new qualified personnel could hurt our business and inhibit our ability to operate and grow successfully 

our success in the highly competitive pizza delivery and carryout business will continue to depend to a significant extent on our leadership team and other key management personnel other than with our president and chief executive officer j patrick doyle we do not have longterm employment agreements with any of our executive officers as a result we may not be able to retain our executive officers and key personnel or attract additional qualified management while we do not have longterm employment agreements with our executive officers for all of our executive officers we have noncompete and nonsolicitation agreements that extend for 24 months following the termination of such executive officer’s employment our success also will continue to depend on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel to operate our stores dough manufacturing and supply chain centers and international operations the loss of these employees or our inability to recruit and retain qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 

  

our international operations subject us to additional risk such risks and costs may differ in each country in which we and our franchisees do business and may cause our profitability to decline due to increased costs 

we conduct a growing portion of our business outside the united states our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected if global markets in which our franchise stores compete are affected by changes in political economic or other factors these factors over which neither we nor our franchisees have control may include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 adverse economic conditions and the global debt crisis subject us to additional risk 

our financial condition and results of operations are impacted by global markets and economic conditions over which neither we nor our franchisees have control an economic downturn may result in a reduction in the demand for our products longer payment cycles slower adoption of new technologies and increased price competition poor economic conditions may adversely affect the ability of our franchisees to pay royalties or amounts owed and could have a material adverse impact on our ability to pursue our growth strategy which would reduce cash collections and in turn may materially and adversely affect our ability to service our debt obligations 

the ongoing deterioration of the sovereign debt of several european countries together with the risk of contagion to other more stable countries has exacerbated the global economic crisis despite taking various measures including the creation of the european financial stability fund by the european commission and the allocation of funds to affected countries concerns persist regarding the debt burden of these countries and their ability to meet future financial obligations the european debt crisis has also raised concerns over the overall stability of the euro and the suitability of the euro as a single currency given the diverse economic and political circumstances among countries that use the euro as their currency these concerns could lead to the reintroduction of individual currencies in one or more of these countries or in more extreme circumstances the possible dissolution of the euro currency entirely should the euro dissolve entirely the legal and contractual consequences for holders of euro denominated obligations would be determined by laws in effect at such time in addition the capital market disruption that would likely accompany any such redenomination event could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity and financial condition furthermore any redenomination event would likely be accompanied by significant economic dislocation particularly within the eurozone countries which in turn could have an adverse impact on demand for our products and accordingly on our revenue and cash flows as of december 30 2012 we had 1676 stores in europe up from 975 in 2008 

as part of the reforms to resolve the european debt crisis some european countries have adopted or may adopt austerity measures in terms of fiscal policy which could negatively impact employment consumer confidence and household disposable income resulting in reduced consumer expenditures for our products such austerity measures could also adversely affect the ability of third party suppliers to meet our requirements in a timely fashion or at all there can be no assurance that any such austerity measures will be successful or that future assistance packages will be available or even if provided will be sufficient to stabilize the affected countries and markets in europe or elsewhere 

nations outside of the european union also face significant debt burdens which have the potential to negatively impact the global economy on august 5 2011 standard  poor’s lowered its long term sovereign credit rating on the united states of america from aaa to aa this downgrade along with market concerns about possible further downgrades and about the government’s credit in general could have a material adverse impact on financial markets and economic conditions in the united states and throughout the world 

  

fluctuations in the value of the us dollar in relation to other currencies may lead to lower revenues and earnings 

exchange rate fluctuations could have an adverse effect on our results of operations approximately 112 of our total revenues in 2010 122 of our total revenues in 2011 and 130 of our revenues in 2012 were derived from our international segment a majority of which were denominated in foreign currencies sales made by franchise stores outside the united states are denominated in the currency of the country in which the store is located and this currency could become less valuable in us dollars as a result of exchange rate fluctuations unfavorable currency fluctuations could lead to increased prices to customers outside the united states or lower profitability to our franchisees outside the united states or could result in lower revenues for us on a us dollar basis from such customers and franchisees a hypothetical 10 adverse change in the foreign currency rates in each of our top ten international markets based on store count would have resulted in a negative impact on revenues of approximately 87 million in 2012 

we may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property which could harm the value of our brand and branded products and adversely affect our business 

we depend in large part on our brand and branded products and believe that they are very important to our business we rely on a combination of trademarks copyrights service marks trade secrets and similar intellectual property rights to protect our brand and branded products the success of our business depends on our continued ability to use our existing trademarks and service marks in order to increase brand awareness and further develop our branded products in both domestic and international markets we have registered certain trademarks and have other trademark registrations pending in the united states and foreign jurisdictions not all of the trademarks that we currently use have been registered in all of the countries in which we do business and they may never be registered in all of these countries we may not be able to adequately protect our trademarks and our use of these trademarks may result in liability for trademark infringement trademark dilution or unfair competition all of the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property in the united states and in foreign countries may not be adequate in addition the laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states further through acquisitions of third parties we may acquire brands and related trademarks that are subject to the same risks as the brands and trademarks we currently own 

we may from time to time be required to institute litigation to enforce our trademarks or other intellectual property rights or to protect our trade secrets such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could negatively affect our sales profitability and prospects regardless of whether we are able to successfully enforce our rights 

our earnings and business growth strategy depends on the success of our franchisees and we may be harmed by actions taken by our franchisees or employees of our franchisees that are outside of our control 

a significant portion of our earnings comes from royalties generated by our franchise stores franchisees are independent operators and their employees are not our employees we provide limited training and support to franchisees but the quality of franchise store operations may be diminished by any number of factors beyond our control consequently franchisees may not successfully operate stores in a manner consistent with our standards and requirements or may not hire and train qualified managers and other store personnel if they do not our image and reputation may suffer and as a result our revenues and stock price could decline while we try to ensure that our franchisees maintain the quality of our brand and branded products our franchisees may take actions that adversely affect the value of our intellectual property or reputation as of december 30 2012 we had 1026 domestic franchisees operating 4540 domestic stores nine of these franchisees each operate over 50 domestic stores including our largest domestic franchisee who operates 135 stores and the average franchisee owns and operates four stores in addition our international master franchisees are generally responsible for the development of significantly more stores than our domestic franchisees as a result our international operations are more closely tied to the success of a smaller number of franchisees than our domestic operations our largest international master franchisee operates 911 stores in five markets which accounts for approximately 17 of our total international store count our domestic and international franchisees may not operate their franchises successfully if one or more of our key franchisees were to become insolvent or otherwise were unable or unwilling to pay us our royalties or other amounts owed our business and results of operations would be adversely affected 

  

interruption failure or compromise of our information technology communications systems and electronic data could hurt our ability to effectively serve our customers and protect customer data which could damage our reputation and adversely affect our business and operating results 

an increasingly significant portion of our retail sales depends on the continuing operation of our information technology and communications systems including but not limited to domino’s pulse™ our online ordering platform and our credit card processing systems our information technology communication systems and electronic data may be vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes terrorist attacks floods fires power loss telecommunications failures computer viruses loss of data unauthorized data breaches or other attempts to harm our systems additionally we operate data centers that are also subject to breakins sabotage and intentional acts of vandalism that could cause disruptions in our ability to serve our customers and protect customer data some of our systems are not fully redundant and our disaster recovery planning cannot account for all eventualities the occurrence of a natural disaster intentional sabotage or other unanticipated problems could result in lengthy interruptions in our service any errors or vulnerabilities in our systems or damage to or failure of our systems could result in interruptions in our services and noncompliance with certain regulations which could reduce our revenues and profits and damage our business and brand 

we rely on proprietary and commercially available systems software tools and monitoring to provide security for processing transmission and storage of confidential customer information such as payment card and personal information and any unauthorized data breaches could damage our reputation and adversely affect our business  

unauthorized intrusion into the portions of our computer systems or those of our franchisees that process and store information related to customer transactions may result in the theft of customer data furthermore the systems currently used for transmission and approval of payment card transactions and the technology utilized in payment cards themselves all of which can put payment card data at risk are determined and mandated by payment card industry standards not by us in addition to improper activities by third parties bugs in newlydeployed or early stage advances in hardware and software capabilities encryption technology and other events or developments may facilitate or result in a compromise or breach of our computer systems any such compromises or breaches could cause interruptions in operations and damage to the reputation of the domino’s pizza ® brand subject us to costs and liabilities and hurt sales revenues and profits 

we are subject to extensive government regulation and requirements issued by other groups and our failure to comply with existing or increased regulations could adversely affect our business and operating results 

we are subject to numerous federal state local and foreign laws and regulations as well as requirements issued by other groups including those relating to 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 the patient protection and affordable care act requires employers such as us to provide health insurance for all qualifying employees or pay penalties for not providing coverage we are evaluating the impact the new law will have on us and although we cannot predict with certainty the financial and operational impacts the new law will have we expect that the requirement that we provide expanded health care coverage to employees above what we currently provide could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position as well as some of our larger franchisees we anticipate the increases in costs will begin in 2014 and escalate in subsequent years such increases may be large enough to materially impact labor costs for us and our franchisees 

  

we may also become subject to legislation or regulation seeking to tax andor regulate highfat foods foods with high sugar and salt content or foods otherwise deemed to be “unhealthy” if we fail to comply with existing or future laws and regulations we may be subject to governmental or judicial fines or sanctions in addition our capital expenditures could increase due to remediation measures that may be required if we are found to be noncompliant with any of these laws or regulations 

we are also subject to a federal trade commission rule and to various state and foreign laws that govern the offer and sale of franchises additionally these laws regulate various aspects of the franchise relationship including terminations and the refusal to renew franchises the failure to comply with these laws and regulations in any jurisdiction or to obtain required government approvals could result in a ban or temporary suspension on future franchise sales fines or other penalties or require us to make offers of rescission or restitution any of which could adversely affect our business and operating results 

our current insurance coverage may not be adequate insurance premiums for such coverage may increase and we may not be able to obtain insurance at acceptable rates or at all 

we have retention programs for workers’ compensation general liability and owned and nonowned automobile liabilities we are generally responsible for up to 10 million per occurrence under these retention programs for workers’ compensation and general liability we are also generally responsible for between 500000 and 30 million per occurrence under these retention programs for owned and nonowned automobile liabilities total insurance limits under these retention programs vary depending upon the period covered and range up to 1100 million per occurrence for general liability and owned and nonowned automobile liabilities and up to the applicable statutory limits for workers’ compensation these insurance policies may not be adequate to protect us from liabilities that we incur in our business in addition in the future our insurance premiums may increase and we may not be able to obtain similar levels of insurance on reasonable terms or at all any such inadequacy of or inability to obtain insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our annual and quarterly financial results are subject to significant fluctuations depending on various factors many of which are beyond our control and if we fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors our share price may decline significantly 

our sales and operating results can vary significantly from quartertoquarter and yeartoyear depending on various factors many of which are beyond our control these factors include among other things 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 as a result our operational performance may decline quickly and significantly in response to changes in order patterns or rapid decreases in demand for our products we anticipate that fluctuations in operating results will continue in the future 

our common stock price could be subject to significant fluctuations andor may decline 

the market price of our common stock could be subject to significant fluctuations among the factors that could affect our stock price are 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 the stock markets in general have experienced volatility that has sometimes been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies these broad market fluctuations may cause the trading price of our common stock to decline 

  

our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our business and limit our ability to plan for or respond to changes in our business 

we have a substantial amount of indebtedness as of december 30 2012 our consolidated longterm indebtedness was approximately 156 billion we may also incur additional debt which would not be prohibited under the terms of our current securitized debt agreements our substantial indebtedness could have important consequences to our business and our shareholders for example it could 

 

  

  

  

 in addition the financial and other covenants we agreed to with our lenders may limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness make investments pay dividends and engage in other transactions and the leverage may cause potential lenders to be less willing to loan funds to us in the future our failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default that if not cured or waived could result in the acceleration of repayment of all of our indebtedness 

we may be unable to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our significant debt service obligations which would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

our ability to make principal and interest payments on and to refinance our indebtedness will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future this to a certain extent is subject to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control if our business does not generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the amounts projected or at all or if future borrowings are not available to us under our variable funding notes in amounts sufficient to fund our other liquidity needs our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected if we cannot generate sufficient cash flow from operations to make scheduled principal and interest payments on our debt obligations in the future we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity sell assets delay capital expenditures or seek additional equity if we are unable to refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all or to effect any other action relating to our indebtedness on satisfactory terms or at all our business may be harmed 

the terms of our securitized debt financing of certain of our whollyowned subsidiaries have restrictive terms and our failure to comply with any of these terms could put us in default which would have an adverse effect on our business and prospects 

unless and until we repay all outstanding borrowings under our securitized debt we will remain subject to the restrictive terms of these borrowings the securitized debt under which certain of our whollyowned subsidiaries issued and guaranteed fixed rate notes and variable funding senior revolving notes contain a number of covenants with the most significant financial covenant being a debt service coverage calculation these covenants limit the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to among other things 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 the securitized debt also requires us to maintain a specified financial ratio at the end of each fiscal quarter these restrictions could affect our ability to pay dividends or repurchase shares of our common stock our ability to meet this financial ratio can be affected by events beyond our control and we may not satisfy such a test a breach of this covenant could result in a rapid amortization event or default under the securitized debt if amounts owed under the securitized debt are accelerated because of a default under the securitized debt and we are unable to pay such amounts the insurers have the right to assume control of substantially all of the securitized assets 

  

during the sevenyear term following issuance the senior notes will accrue interest at a fixed rate of 5216 per year additionally the senior notes have scheduled principal payments of 236 million in each of 2013 and 2014 295 million in 2015 374 million in 2016 394 million in each of 2017 and 2018 and 98 million in 2019 if we meet certain conditions including a maximum leverage ratio of 45x total debt to ebitda we may elect to not make the scheduled principal payments if the leverage ratio subsequently exceeds 45x we must make up the payments we had elected not to make 

if we are unable to refinance or repay amounts under the securitized debt prior to the expiration of the sevenyear term our cash flow would be directed to the repayment of the securitized debt and other than a weekly management fee sufficient to cover minimal selling general and administrative expenses would not be available for operating our business 

no assurance can be given that any refinancing or additional financing will be possible when needed or that we will be able to negotiate acceptable terms in addition our access to capital is affected by prevailing conditions in the financial and capital markets and other factors beyond our control there can be no assurance that market conditions will be favorable at the times that we require new or additional financing 

the indenture governing the securitized debt will restrict the cash flow from the entities subject to the securitization to any of our other entities and upon the occurrence of certain events cash flow would be further restricted 

in the event that a rapid amortization event occurs under the indenture including without limitation upon an event of default under the indenture or the failure to repay the securitized debt at the end of the sevenyear term the funds available to us would be reduced or eliminated which would in turn reduce our ability to operate or grow our business

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

overview 

our fiscal year typically includes 52 weeks comprised of three twelveweek quarters and one sixteenweek quarter every five or six years our fiscal year includes an extra or 53 rd  week in the fourth quarter fiscal 2010 fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2012 each consisted of 52 weeks 

description of the business 

we are the number one pizza delivery company in the united states with a 225 share of the pizza delivery market based on reported consumer spending we also have a leading international presence and rank as the second largest pizza company in the world based on number of units we operate through a network of 388 companyowned stores all of which are in the united states and 9867 franchise stores located in all 50 states and in more than 70 international markets in addition we operate 19 regional manufacturing and supply chain centers in the contiguous united states as well as six dough manufacturing and supply chain centers outside the contiguous united states 

our financial results are driven largely by retail sales at our franchise and companyowned stores changes in retail sales are driven by changes in same store sales and store counts we monitor both of these metrics very closely as they directly impact our revenues and profits and strive to consistently increase both same store sales and our store counts retail sales drive royalty payments from franchisees as well as companyowned store and supply chain revenues retail sales are primarily impacted by the strength of the domino’s pizza ® brand the results of our marketing promotions our ability to execute our store operating model the overall global economic environment and the success of our business strategies 

we devote significant attention to our brandbuilding efforts which is evident in our system’s estimated 14 billion of domestic advertising spending over the past five years and our frequent designation as a megabrand by advertising age  we plan on continuing to build our brand and retail sales by satisfying customers worldwide with our pizza delivery and carryout offerings and by continuing to invest significant amounts in the advertising and marketing of the domino’s pizza ® brand 

we also pay particular attention to the store economics or the investment performance of a store to its owner of both our franchise and companyowned stores we believe that our system’s favorable store economics benefit from the relatively small initial and ongoing investments required to own and operate a domino’s pizza store we believe these favorable investment requirements coupled with a strong brand message supported by significant advertising spending as well as highquality and focused menu offerings drive strong store economics which in turn drive demand for new stores 

business performance 

during 2012 the company continued to produce steady consistent results with strong earnings per share growth and cash flows the company produced positive order count growth sales growth and store growth domestically while also producing sales growth and record store growth internationally in 2012 we celebrated the opening of our 10000 th store which is a significant milestone for our global brand the results in 2012 demonstrated that we continue to deliver the products service and value that are resonating with our global consumers we have continued to improve store level profitability for our domestic franchise and companyowned stores in 2012 further over the past several years our focus domestically has been improving our company through several initiatives including investments to improve upon our menu marketing technology operations and franchise base our menu improvements in 2012 included launching our parmesan bread bites and our new handmade pan pizza technology remains a focus for us as digital orders continue to grow in 2011 we launched a new mobile application for the iphone and ipod touch and in 2012 we launched a new mobile application for the android smartphone and for amazon’s kindle fire we believe our new product platforms combined with an innovative transparent and effective advertising campaign continued focus on operational excellence and new technology generated strong sales and earnings growth for the company in 2010 2011 and 2012 

  

our international division continued to post strong same store sales growth 52 in 2012 and had a record 492 net store openings including 113 net stores in india 64 net stores in turkey and 50 net stores in the united kingdom continued strong same store sales growth combined with continued store count growth demonstrate the consistency and reliability of this growing business segment 

these strong results from both our domestic and international stores produced earnings per share growth and increased cash flows in 2012 we believe that our franchise business model provides a solid structure on which to build consistent retail sales and store growth that results in strong cash flows that we can deploy to drive shareholder value 

worldwide store counts have increased from 8999 at the beginning of 2010 to 10255 at the end of 2012 this growth in store counts can be attributed to the global growth of our brand and our pizza delivery and carryout concepts as well as the economics inherent in our system which attract new franchisees and encourage existing franchisees to grow their businesses domestic same store sales increased 99 in 2010 35 in 2011 and 31 in 2012 the significant increase in domestic same store sales in 2010 was attributable to our innovative and effective advertising campaign for our improved pizza recipe continued focus on operational excellence and efforts to strengthen our franchisee base over the course of several years the increase in domestic same store sales during both 2011 and 2012 demonstrates that our products and promotions continue to resonate with consumers the company experienced traffic increases in our domestic stores in 2010 2011 and 2012 international same store sales increased 69 in 2010 68 in 2011 and 52 in 2012 internationally same stores sales growth continues to result from the growing acceptance of pizza and delivered pizza around the globe and the successful execution of the domino’s pizza concept 

in 2012 global retail sales which are total retail sales at companyowned and franchise stores worldwide increased 65 as compared to 2011 retail sales for franchise stores are reported to the company by its franchisees and are not included in company revenues this increase was driven primarily by both domestic and international same store sales growth as well as an increase in our worldwide store counts during the trailing four quarters offset in part by the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates domestic same store sales growth reflected the sustained positive sales trends and the continued success of our new products and promotions international same store sales growth reflected continued strong performance in the markets where we compete in 2011 global retail sales increased 110 as compared to 2010 driven primarily by both domestic and international same store sales growth growth in worldwide store counts and the positive impact of foreign currency exchange rates on our international sales 

our revenues increased 262 million or 16 in 2012 and increased 813 million or 52 in 2011 the increase in revenues in 2012 was driven primarily by higher international revenues attributable to same store sales and store count growth higher supply chain revenues due primarily to a change in the mix of products sold offset in part by slightly lower volumes and higher domestic franchise revenues due to an increase in same store sales these increases were offset in part by lower companyowned store revenues resulting from the sale of 58 companyowned stores to multiple franchisees during fiscal 2011 and six companyowned stores in the first quarter of 2012 as well as the negative impact on international revenues of changes in foreign currency exchange rates the increase in revenues in 2011 was driven by higher domestic supply chain revenues resulting from higher cheese and other commodity prices and higher international revenues attributable to same store sales store count growth and the positive impact of foreign currency exchange rates additionally domestic franchise revenues were higher due to an increase in domestic same store sales and fees paid by franchisees related to the insourcing of certain services such as online ordering and a call center we also incurred an increase in general and administrative expenses for these services paid by franchisees these increases were offset in part by lower companyowned store revenues resulting from the sale of 58 companyowned stores to multiple franchisees during 2011 

income from operations increased 232 million or 89 in 2012 and increased 314 million or 138 in 2011 the increase in 2012 was driven primarily by higher royalty revenues from both domestic and international franchise stores higher domestic companyowned store margins and higher domestic supply chain margins as described in more detail below these increases were offset in part by the negative impact of the changes in foreign currency exchange rates and higher general and administrative expenses the increase in 2011 was driven primarily by higher royalty revenues from both domestic and international franchise stores and to a lesser extent the positive impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates additionally income from operations in 2011 benefited from higher domestic companyowned store margins 

  

net income increased 70 million or 67 in 2012 and increased 175 million or 198 in 2011 the increase in 2012 was due primarily to domestic and international same store sales growth global store growth higher domestic companyowned store margins and higher domestic supply chain margins and was negatively impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates and higher general and administrative expenses additionally fiscal 2012 was negatively impacted by approximately 105 million of net pretax expenses incurred in connection with the company’s recapitalization the increase in net income in 2011 was due primarily to the aforementioned increase in income from operations and lower interest expense the increase was offset in part by gains recorded on the extinguishment of debt in 2010 

we operate with significant levels of debt as of december 30 2012 consolidated debt was 156 billion historically a large portion of our cash flows from operations has been used to make principal and interest payments on our indebtedness as well as distributions to shareholders in the form of dividends and stock repurchases our securitized debt requires principal and interest payments until the expected repayment date of january 2019 the scheduled principal payments are 236 million in each of 2013 and 2014 295 million in 2015 374 million in 2016 394 million in each of 2017 and 2018 and 98 million in 2019 during fiscal 2012 the company made principal payments of approximately 177 million overall we believe that our ability to consistently produce significant excess cash flows allows us the flexibility not only to service our debt but also to invest in our growing business as well as return cash to our shareholders 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america the preparation of these financial statements requires our management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis our management evaluates its estimates including those related to revenue recognition allowances for uncollectible receivables longlived and intangible assets insurance and legal matters sharebased payments and income taxes we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from those estimates changes in our accounting policies and estimates could materially impact our results of operations and financial condition for any particular period we believe that our most critical accounting policies and estimates are 

revenue recognition  we earn revenues through our network of domestic companyowned and franchise stores dough manufacturing and supply chain centers and international operations retail sales from companyowned stores and royalty revenues resulting from the retail sales from franchise stores are recognized as revenues when the items are delivered to or carried out by customers retail sales are generally reported and related royalties paid to the company on a weekly basis based on a percentage of retail sales as specified in the related standard franchise agreement generally 55 of domestic franchise retail sales in the event that retail sales are not reported timely by a franchisee the company will record royalty revenues in the period earned based on an estimate of the franchisee’s sales however these estimates are not significant and have historically been materially consistent with the actual amounts revenues from companyowned stores and royalty revenues from franchise stores fluctuate from timetotime as a result of store count changes for example if a companyowned store that generated 500000 in revenue in fiscal 2011 is sold to a franchisee in fiscal 2012 revenues from companyowned stores would have declined by 500000 in fiscal 2012 while franchise royalty revenues would have increased by only 27500 in fiscal 2012 as we generally collect 55 of a domestic franchisee’s retail sales sales of food from our supply chain centers are recognized as revenues upon delivery of the food to franchisees while sales of equipment and supplies are generally recognized as revenues upon shipment of the related products to franchisees 

allowances for uncollectible receivables we closely monitor our accounts and notes receivable balances and provide allowances for uncollectible amounts as a result of our reviews these estimates are based on among other factors historical collection experience and a review of our receivables by aging category additionally we may also provide allowances for uncollectible receivables based on specific customer collection issues that we have identified while writeoffs of bad debts have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established management cannot guarantee that future writeoffs will not exceed historical rates specifically if the financial condition of our franchisees were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments additional allowances may be required 

  

at december 30 2012 our total allowance for uncollectible accounts receivables was approximately 59 million compared to 54 million at january 1 2012 representing approximately 59 of our consolidated gross accounts receivable at both those respective yearends a 10 change in our allowance for uncollectible accounts receivables at december 30 2012 would result in a change in reserves of approximately 06 million and a change in income before provision for income taxes by the same amount currently management does not believe that there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions that were used to calculate our allowance for uncollectible accounts receivables 

longlived and intangible assets we record longlived assets including property plant and equipment and capitalized software at cost for acquisitions of franchise operations we estimate the fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired based on physical inspection of assets historical experience and other information available to us regarding the acquisition we depreciate and amortize longlived assets using useful lives determined by us based on historical experience and other information available to us we evaluate the potential impairment of longlived assets at least annually based on various analyses including the projection of undiscounted cash flows and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable for companyowned stores we perform related impairment tests on an operating market basis which the company has determined to be the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of other cash flows if the carrying amount of a longlived asset exceeds the amount of the expected future undiscounted cash flows of that asset or the estimated fair value of the asset an impairment loss is recognized and the asset is written down to its estimated fair value 

we have not made any significant changes in the methodology used to project the future market cash flows of companyowned stores during the years presented same store sales fluctuations and the rates at which operating costs will fluctuate in the future are key factors in evaluating recoverability of the related assets if our same store sales significantly decline or if operating costs increase and we are unable to recover these costs the carrying value of our companyowned stores by market may be unrecoverable and we may be required to recognize an impairment charge at december 30 2012 we determined that our longlived assets were not impaired 

a significant portion of our goodwill relates to acquisitions of domestic franchise stores and is included in our domestic stores segment specifically our companyowned stores we evaluate goodwill annually for impairment by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit which is primarily determined using the present value of historical cash flows to its carrying value if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value goodwill would be impaired we have not made any significant changes in the methodology used to evaluate goodwill impairment during the years presented at december 30 2012 the fair value of our business operations with associated goodwill exceeded their recorded carrying value including the related goodwill if cash flows generated by our companyowned stores were to decline significantly in the future or there were negative revisions to the market multiple assumption we may be required to recognize a goodwill impairment charge however based on the latest impairment analysis we do not believe it is reasonably likely that there could be changes in assumptions that would trigger impairment 

insurance and legal matters we are a party to lawsuits and legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business management closely monitors these legal matters and estimates the probable costs for the resolution of such matters these estimates are primarily determined by consulting with both internal and external parties handling the matters and are based upon an analysis of potential results assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies while historically our actual losses have been materially consistent with our reserves legal judgments can be volatile and difficult to predict accordingly if our estimates relating to legal matters proved inaccurate for any reason we may be required to increase or decrease the related expense in future periods we had accruals for legal matters of approximately 101 million at january 1 2012 and approximately 50 million at december 30 2012 

for certain periods prior to december 1998 and for periods after december 2001 we maintain insurance coverage for workers’ compensation general liability and owned and nonowned auto liability under insurance policies requiring payment of a deductible for each occurrence up to between 500000 and 30 million depending on the policy year and line of coverage the related insurance reserves are based on undiscounted independent actuarial estimates which are based on historical information along with assumptions about future events specifically various methods including analyses of historical trends and actuarial valuation methods are utilized to estimate the cost to settle reported claims and claims incurred but not yet reported the actuarial valuation methods develop estimates of the future ultimate claim costs based on the claims incurred as of the balance sheet date when estimating these liabilities several factors are considered including the severity duration and frequency of claims legal cost associated with claims healthcare trends and projected inflation over the past several years we have experienced improvements in frequency of claims however increasing severity of claims and medical costs has partially offset these trends 

  

our methodology for determining our exposure has remained consistent throughout the years presented management believes that the various assumptions developed and actuarial methods used to determine our selfinsurance reserves are reasonable and provide meaningful data that management uses to make its best estimate of our exposure to these risks while historically our actual losses have been materially consistent with our reserves changes in assumptions for such factors as medical costs and legal actions as well as changes in actual experience could cause our estimates to change in the near term which could result in an increase or decrease in the related expense in future periods a 10 change in our selfinsurance liability at december 30 2012 would have affected our income before provision for income taxes by approximately 37 million for fiscal 2012 we had accruals for insurance matters of approximately 344 million at january 1 2012 and 372 million at december 30 2012 

sharebased payments we recognize compensation expense related to our sharebased compensation arrangements over the requisite service period based on the grant date fair value of the awards the grant date fair value of each restricted stock and performancebased restricted stock award is equal to the market price of our stock on the date of grant the grant date fair value of each stock option award is estimated using a blackscholes option pricing model the pricing model requires assumptions including the expected life of the stock option the riskfree interest rate the expected dividend yield and expected volatility of our stock over the expected life which significantly impact the assumed fair value we are also required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and only recognize expense for those awards expected to vest we use historical data to determine these assumptions additionally our stock option restricted stock and performancebased restricted stock arrangements provide for accelerated vesting and the ability to exercise during the remainder of the tenyear stock option life upon the retirement of individuals holding the awards who have achieved specified service and age requirements management believes that the methods and various assumptions used to determine compensation expense related to these arrangements are reasonable but if the assumptions change significantly for future grants sharebased compensation expense will fluctuate in future years 

income taxes we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities and reserves for uncertain tax positions we measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using current enacted tax rates that will apply in the years in which we expect the temporary differences to be recovered or paid judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes and related reserves deferred tax assets and liabilities these include establishing a valuation allowance related to the ability to realize certain deferred tax assets if necessary during fiscal 2012 and in connection with the sale of its six remaining companyowned stores in a certain market to a franchisee the company recorded a deferred tax asset related to the capital loss that resulted from the writeoff of the tax basis goodwill associated with the market that was sold management believes it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized and provided a valuation allowance of approximately 09 million the valuation allowance was recorded as an increase to the provision for income taxes and increased the company’s effective tax rate in 2012 on an ongoing basis management will assess whether it remains more likely than not that the net deferred tax asset will be realized the company had no additional valuation allowances recorded for deferred tax assets as of december 30 2012 our accounting for deferred tax assets represents our best estimate of future events our net deferred tax assets assume that we will generate sufficient taxable income in specific tax jurisdictions based on our estimates and assumptions changes in our current estimates due to unanticipated events could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operation 

the amounts relating to taxes recorded on the balance sheet including tax reserves also consider the ultimate resolution of revenue agent reviews based on estimates and assumptions we believe we have adequately accounted for our uncertain tax positions however tax audits changes in tax laws and other unforeseen matters may result in us owing additional taxes we adjust our reserves for uncertain tax positions when facts and circumstances change or due to the passage of time for example the completion of a tax audit or the expiration of a statute of limitations or changes in penalty and interest reserves associated with uncertain tax positions management believes that our tax positions comply with applicable tax law and that we have adequately provided for these matters however to the extent the final tax outcome of these matters is different than our recorded amounts we may be required to adjust our tax reserves resulting in additional income tax expense or benefit in future periods

tabular amounts in millions except percentages 

revenues revenues primarily consist of retail sales from our companyowned stores royalties from our domestic and international franchise stores and sales of food equipment and supplies from our supply chain centers to substantially all of our domestic franchise stores and certain international franchise stores companyowned store and franchise store revenues may vary significantly from period to period due to changes in store count mix while supply chain revenues may vary significantly as a result of fluctuations in commodity prices primarily cheese and meats 

  

consolidated revenues increased 262 million or 16 in 2012 this increase in revenues was due primarily to higher international revenues attributable to same store sales and store count growth higher supply chain revenues due primarily to a change in the mix of products sold offset in part by slightly lower volumes and higher domestic franchise revenues due to an increase in same store sales and store count growth these increases were offset in part by lower companyowned store revenues resulting from the sale of 58 companyowned stores to multiple franchisees during fiscal 2011 and six companyowned stores in the first quarter of 2012 and the negative impact on international revenues of changes in foreign currency exchange rates these changes in revenues are more fully described below 

domestic stores domestic stores revenues are primarily comprised of retail sales from domestic companyowned store operations as well as royalties from retail sales and other fees from domestic franchise stores as summarized in the following table 

 

 domestic stores revenues decreased 47 million or 09 in 2012 this decrease was due primarily to lower companyowned store revenues resulting from the sale of 58 companyowned stores to multiple franchisees during fiscal 2011 and six companyowned stores in the first quarter of 2012 the decrease was offset in part by higher domestic companyowned and franchise same store sales these results are more fully described below 

domestic companyowned stores revenues from domestic companyowned store operations decreased 126 million or 38 in 2012 this decrease was due to fewer companyowned stores being open during 2012 primarily as a result of the sale of 58 companyowned stores to multiple franchisees during fiscal 2011 and six companyowned stores in the first quarter of 2012 the decrease was partially offset by a 13 increase in same store sales compared to 2011 there were 394 domestic companyowned stores in operation as of january 1 2012 and 388 domestic companyowned stores in operation as of december 30 2012 

domestic franchise revenues from domestic franchise operations increased 80 million or 43 in 2012 this increase was due primarily to higher domestic franchise same store sales and an increase in the average number of domestic franchise stores open during 2012 additionally domestic franchise revenues in 2012 benefited from a 32 increase in same store sales compared to 2011 there were 4513 domestic franchise stores in operation as of january 1 2012 and 4540 domestic franchise stores in operation as of december 30 2012 

domestic supply chain revenues from domestic supply chain operations increased 143 million or 15 in 2012 this increase was due primarily to a change in the mix of products sold and an increase in the number of franchise stores in operation this was offset in part by slightly lower volumes and slightly lower overall commodity prices including cheese cheese prices negatively impacted revenues by approximately 99 million in 2012 

international international revenues primarily consist of royalties from our international franchise stores and international supply chain sales revenues from international operations increased 167 million or 83 in 2012 this increase was due primarily to higher international royalty and other revenues and higher international supply chain revenues this increase was negatively impacted by approximately 40 million related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates these changes in international revenues are more fully described below 

 

 international royalty and other revenues from international royalties and other increased 122 million or 112 in 2012 this increase was due primarily to higher same store sales and an increase in the average number of international stores open during 2012 offset in part by the negative impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates of approximately 40 million in 2012 on a constant dollar basis which excludes the impact of foreign currency exchange rates same store sales increased 52 in 2012 compared to 2011 on a historical dollar basis which includes the impact of foreign currency exchange rates same store sales increased 21 in 2012 compared to 2011 the variance in our same store sales on a constant dollar basis versus a historical dollar basis in 2012 was caused by stronger us dollar when compared to the currencies in the international markets in which we compete there were 4835 international stores in operation as of january 1 2012 and 5327 international stores in operation as of december 30 2012 

  

international supply chain revenues from international supply chain operations increased 45 million or 49 in 2012 this increase resulted primarily from higher volumes in 2012 

cost of sales  operating margin consolidated cost of sales consists primarily of domestic companyowned store and supply chain costs incurred to generate related revenues components of consolidated cost of sales primarily include food labor and occupancy costs 

the consolidated operating margin which we define as revenues less cost of sales increased 308 million or 66 in 2012 as summarized in the following table 

 

 the 308 million increase in consolidated operating margin was due primarily to higher domestic and international franchise revenues higher margins at our companyowned stores and higher domestic supply chain margins franchise revenues do not have a cost of sales component and as such changes in franchise revenues have a disproportionate effect on the consolidated operating margin 

as a percentage of total revenues our consolidated operating margin increased 14 percentage points in 2012 due primarily to a higher mix of franchise revenues higher companyowned stores operating margins and lower overall commodity prices including cheese 

domestic companyowned stores the domestic companyowned store operating margin which does not include other storelevel costs such as royalties and advertising increased 70 million or 101 in 2012 as summarized in the following table 

 

 the 70 million increase in the domestic companyowned store operating margin was due primarily to lower food costs lower labor and related expenses lower occupancy expenses lower insurance expenses and the positive impact of a higher average customer price paid per order the sale of 58 companyowned stores to multiple franchisees in fiscal 2011 and six companyowned stores in the first quarter of 2012 had a slightly positive impact on the domestic companyowned stores operating margin in 2012 as a percentage of store revenues the store operating margin increased 30 percentage points in 2012 as discussed in more detail below 

as a percentage of store revenues food costs decreased 12 percentage points to 271 in 2012 due primarily to the positive impact of a higher average customer price paid per order and lower overall commodity prices including cheese the cheese block price per pound averaged 169 in 2012 compared to 180 in 2011 

as a percentage of store revenues occupancy costs which include rent telephone utilities and depreciation decreased 08 percentage points to 95 in 2012 due primarily to lower rates and reduced usage per store and to a lesser extent the positive impact of a higher average customer price paid per order on utilities and depreciation costs per store during fiscal 2012 

as a percentage of store revenues labor and related costs decreased 06 percentage points to 284 in 2012 due primarily to the positive impact of a higher average customer price paid per order during fiscal 2012 

as a percentage of store revenues insurance costs decreased 06 percentage points to 31 in 2012 due primarily to lower health insurance expenses per store 

domestic supply chain the domestic supply chain operating margin increased 27 million or 28 in 2012 as summarized in the following table 

 

 the domestic supply chain operating margin increased 27 million in 2012 due primarily to a change in the mix of products sold offset in part by slightly lower volumes 

  

as a percentage of domestic supply chain revenues the domestic supply chain operating margin increased 01 percentage points in 2012 due primarily to a decrease in overall commodity prices including cheese and a change in the mix of products sold this was offset in part by slightly lower volumes decreases in certain food prices including cheese have a positive effect on the domestic supply chain operating margin percentage due to the fixed dollar margin earned by domestic supply chain on certain food items had the 2012 cheese prices been in effect during 2011 the domestic supply chain operating margin as a percentage of domestic supply chain revenues would have been approximately 105 for 2011 versus the reported 104 however the dollar margin would have been unaffected 

general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses increased 76 million or 36 in 2012 approximately 22 million of the increase in general and administrative expenses in fiscal 2012 resulted from pretax gains recorded on the sale of certain companyowned operations in 2011 that did not recur in 2012 additionally approximately 03 million of recapitalizationrelated expenses that were recorded in the first quarter of 2012 negatively impacted the yearoveryear comparison excluding these items general and administrative expenses increased 51 million in fiscal 2012 these increases were primarily due to a 37 million increase in noncash compensation investments in additional technology and international team members and other strategic initiatives 

interest income interest income remained flat at 03 million in 2012 

interest expense interest expense increased 98 million to 1014 million in 2012 the increase was due primarily to approximately 102 million of expenses incurred in the first quarter of 2012 related to the 2012 recapitalization including 81 million of writeoffs of deferred financing fees and the interest rate swap related to the extinguished debt and 21 million of interest expense that was incurred on the 2007 debt subsequent to the closing of the 2012 recapitalization but prior to the repayment of the 2007 debt 

our cash borrowing rate decreased 04 percentage points to 55 during fiscal 2012 our average outstanding debt balance excluding capital lease obligations was approximately 16 billion in 2012 and approximately 14 billion in 2011 the decrease in the company’s cash borrowing rate and the increase in the company’s average outstanding debt balance resulted from the completion of the 2012 recapitalization during the first quarter of 2012 

provision for income taxes provision for income taxes increased 64 million to 688 million in 2012 due primarily to higher pretax income the company’s effective income tax rate increased 08 percentage points to 380 of pretax income in 2012 due primarily to a lower effective income tax rate in 2011 resulting from higher wage credits

domestic stores domestic stores revenues are summarized in the following table 

 

 domestic stores revenues increased 44 million or 08 in 2011 this increase was due primarily to fees paid by franchisees for certain services such as online ordering and a call center and higher domestic companyowned and franchise same store sales the increase was offset in part by the sale of 58 companyowned stores to multiple franchisees during fiscal 2011 these results are more fully described below 

  

domestic companyowned stores revenues from domestic companyowned store operations decreased 93 million or 27 in 2011 this decrease was due primarily to a fewer number of companyowned stores open during 2011 resulting primarily from the sale of 58 companyowned stores to multiple franchisees during fiscal 2011 the decrease was partially offset by a 41 increase in same store sales compared to 2010 there were 454 domestic companyowned stores in operation as of january 2 2011 and 394 domestic companyowned stores in operation as of january 1 2012

 international royalty and other revenues from international royalties and other increased 166 million or 182 in 2011 this increase was due primarily to higher same store sales and an increase in the average number of international stores open during 2011 as well as the positive impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates of approximately 34 million in 2011 on a constant dollar basis which excludes the impact of foreign currency exchange rates same store sales increased 68 in 2011 compared to 2010 on a historical dollar basis which includes the impact of foreign currency exchange rates same store sales increased 115 in 2011 compared to 2010 the variance in our same store sales on a constant dollar basis versus a historical dollar basis in 2011 was caused by the general weakening of the us dollar compared to the currencies in the international markets in which we compete there were 4422 international stores in operation as of january 2 2011 and 4835 international stores in operation as of january 1 2012 

international supply chain revenues from international supply chain operations increased 79 million or 93 in 2011 this increase resulted from the positive impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates of approximately 32 million as well as higher volumes in 2011 

cost of sales  operating margin the consolidated operating margin increased 319 million or 73 in 2011 as summarized in the following table 

 

 the 319 million increase in consolidated operating margin was due primarily to higher domestic and international franchise revenues franchise revenues do not have a cost of sales component and as such changes in franchise revenues have a disproportionate effect on the consolidated operating margin fiscal 2011 also benefited from higher domestic companyowned store margins as described in more detail below 

as a percentage of total revenues our consolidated operating margin increased 06 percentage points in 2011 due primarily to a change in our mix of revenues and higher companyowned stores operating margins offset in part by an increase in overall commodity prices including cheese 

  

domestic companyowned stores the domestic companyowned store operating margin increased 20 million or 29 in 2011 as summarized in the following table

as a percentage of store revenues labor and related costs decreased 16 percentage points to 290 in 2011 due primarily to labor efficiencies additionally labor and related costs benefited from lower average labor rates in fiscal 2011 

as a percentage of store revenues occupancy costs which include rent telephone utilities and depreciation decreased 06 percentage points to 103 in 2011 primarily resulting from leveraging these fixed expenses with the higher same store sales 

as a percentage of store revenues insurance costs increased 01 percentage points to 37 in 2011 due primarily to higher health insurance expenses 

as a percentage of store revenues food costs increased 09 percentage points to 283 in 2011 due primarily to higher cheese and meat prices during 2011 the cheese block price per pound averaged 180 in 2011 compared to 150 in 2010 

domestic supply chain the domestic supply chain operating margin decreased 08 million or 08 in 2011 as summarized in the following table 

 

 the domestic supply chain operating margin decreased 08 million in 2011 as previously mentioned domestic supply chain revenues increased 524 million in 2011 due primarily to an increase in overall commodity prices including cheese however dollar margins were down in 2011 due to higher operating costs versus the prior year including fuel costs the decrease was offset in part by a favorable mix of products sold during 2011 

as a percentage of domestic supply chain revenues the domestic supply chain operating margin decreased 07 percentage points in 2011 due primarily to higher commodity prices including cheese and meats as well as higher fuel costs increases in certain food prices including cheese have a negative effect on the domestic supply chain operating margin percentage due to the fixed dollar margin earned by domestic supply chain on certain food items had the 2011 cheese prices been in effect during 2010 the domestic supply chain operating margin as a percentage of domestic supply chain revenues would have been approximately 108 for 2010 versus the reported 111 

general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses increased 05 million or 02 in 2011 general and administrative expenses were negatively impacted by 81 million in 2011 due to higher expenses incurred related to the insourcing of certain services such as online ordering and a call center we operate these services as longterm cost recovery initiatives and accordingly we experienced an increase in domestic franchise revenues for these services paid by franchisees general and administrative expenses for 2011 were positively impacted by lower expenses in our supply chain operations further general and administrative expenses benefited from lower variable performancebased bonuses of 41 million in 2011 versus 2010 and by approximately 28 million primarily related to the sale of certain companyowned operations as a percentage of total revenues general and administrative expenses decreased 06 percentage points to 128 in 2011 

interest income interest income increased 01 million to 03 million in 2011 this increase was primarily due to higher invested amounts of restricted and unrestricted cash and cash equivalents in 2011 versus 2010 

interest expense interest expense decreased 52 million to 916 million in 2011 the interest expense comparison benefited from the writeoff of deferred financing fees and payment of insurance fees in connection with debt repurchases in 2010 of approximately 18 million in 2010 additionally interest expense decreased in 2011 due to lower debt balances attributable to our debt repurchases in 2010 

  

our cash borrowing rate was 59 in 2011 and 2010 our average outstanding debt balance excluding capital lease obligations was approximately 14 billion in 2011 and approximately 15 billion in 2010 

other the other amount of 78 million in 2010 represents the net gains recognized on the repurchase and retirement of principal on the fixed rate notes 

provision for income taxes provision for income taxes increased 114 million to 624 million in 2011 due primarily to higher pretax income and a higher effective tax rate the company’s effective income tax rate increased 05 percentage points to 372 of pretax income in 2011 the effective tax rate for 2010 was positively impacted by reserve adjustments related to a state income tax matter 

liquidity and capital resources 

as of december 30 2012 we had working capital of 168 million excluding restricted cash and cash equivalents of 600 million and including total unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of 548 million historically we have operated with minimal positive working capital or negative working capital primarily because our receivable collection periods and inventory turn rates are faster than the normal payment terms on our current liabilities we generally collect our receivables within three weeks from the date of the related sale and we generally experience 30 to 40 inventory turns per year in addition our sales are not typically seasonal which further limits our working capital requirements these factors coupled with the use of our ongoing cash flows from operations to service our debt obligations invest in our business and repurchase our fixed rate notes and our common stock reduce our working capital amounts as of december 30 2012 we had approximately 384 million of restricted cash held for future principal and interest payments 214 million of restricted cash held in a three month interest reserve as required by the related debt agreements and 02 million of other restricted cash for a total of 600 million of restricted cash and cash equivalents 

on march 16 2012 we announced that we had completed the 2012 recapitalization in which certain of our subsidiaries replaced the outstanding 2007 fixed rate notes and variable funding notes the 2007 notes with new notes the notes issued pursuant to an assetbacked securitization the notes consist of 1575 billion of series 20121 5216 fixed rate senior secured notes class a2 the fixed rate notes and 100 million of series 20121 variable funding senior secured notes class a1 the variable funding notes the notes were issued in a private placement transaction by indirect bankruptcyremote subsidiaries that hold substantially all of our revenuegenerating assets excluding companyowned stores the fixed rate notes have an expected maturity of seven years and a legal maturity of 30 years the variable funding notes have an expected maturity of five years with an option for up to two oneyear renewals subject to certain minimum financial conditions and a legal maturity of 30 years the variable funding notes were undrawn on the closing date at december 30 2012 approximately 435 million was pledged against the variable funding notes for outstanding letters of credit leaving 565 million of variable funding notes available for borrowings the letters of credit are primarily related to our casualty insurance programs and supply chain center leases 

the fixed rate notes have scheduled principal payments of 236 million in each of 2013 and 2014 295 million in 2015 374 million in 2016 394 million in each of 2017 and 2018 and 98 million in 2019 during fiscal 2012 we made principal payments of approximately 177 million if we meet certain conditions including a maximum leverage ratio of 45x total debt to ebitda we may elect to not make the scheduled principal payments if the leverage ratio subsequently exceeds 45x we must makeup the payments we had elected not to make 

the notes are subject to certain financial and nonfinancial covenants including a debt service coverage calculation as defined in the related agreements the notes also include a financial covenant based on the achievement of a minimum amount of global retail sales in the event that certain covenants are not met the notes may become due and payable on an accelerated schedule 

we used a portion of the proceeds from the 2012 recapitalization to repay approximately 1447 billion in outstanding principal under the 2007 notes the proceeds were also used to pay accrued interest on the 2007 notes and transactionrelated fees and expenses incurred in connection with the 2012 recapitalization and to fund a reserve account for the payment of interest on the notes 

  

on march 16 2012 our board of directors declared a 300 per share special cash dividend on the outstanding common stock totaling 1711 million which was paid on april 2 2012 to stockholders of record at the close of business on march 26 2012 additionally pursuant to the antidilution provisions in our underlying stock option plans on april 2 2012 we made a corresponding cash payment of approximately 135 million on certain stock options reduced the exercise price on certain other stock options by an equivalent per share amount and in certain circumstances both reduced the stock option exercise price and made a cash payment totaling 300 per share on april 2 2012 we also accrued an estimated 24 million for payments to be made as certain performancebased restricted stock grants vest the dividend and related dividend equivalent payments were funded with the remaining proceeds from the 2012 recapitalization and cash on hand these antidilution payments were accounted for as modificationssettlements and were recorded as increases in total stockholders’ deficit as of december 30 2012 total cash paid for common stock dividends and related antidilution equivalent payments was approximately 1855 million and the total estimated liability recorded for future cash payments on certain performancebased restricted stock was approximately 15 million 

during fiscal 2012 and in connection with the 2012 recapitalization we incurred approximately 105 million of net expenses additionally in connection with the 2012 recapitalization we recorded an additional 325 million of deferred financing costs as an asset in the consolidated balance sheet during fiscal 2012 this amount in addition to the 74 million recorded on the consolidated balance sheet at january 1 2012 is expected to be amortized into interest expense over the sevenyear expected term of the debt 

as of december 30 2012 we had approximately 156 billion of total debt of which 243 million was classified as a current liability additionally as of december 30 2012 we had 435 million of outstanding letters of credit and 565 million of available borrowing capacity under our 1000 million variable funding notes the letters of credit are primarily related to our casualty insurance programs and supply chain center leases borrowings under the variable funding notes are available to fund our working capital requirements capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes our primary source of liquidity is cash flows from operations and availability of borrowings under our variable funding notes 

the company has a board of directors approved open market share repurchase program of the company’s common stock which was reset during the third quarter of 2012 at 2000 million the open market share repurchase program has historically been funded by excess cash flows and borrowings available under the variable funding notes the company used cash of approximately 1650 million and 882 million in 2011 and 2012 respectively for share repurchases under this program the company has approximately 1524 million left under the 2000 million authorization as of december 30 2012 we expect to continue to use ongoing excess cash flow generation and subject to certain restrictions in the documents governing the variable funding notes availability under the variable funding notes to among other things repurchase shares under the current authorized program 

during fiscal 2012 we experienced increases in both domestic and international same store sales versus fiscal 2011 additionally our international business continued to grow stores at a record pace in fiscal 2012 and our international store count surpassed the number of stores domestically these factors have contributed to our continued ability to generate positive operating cash flows we expect to use our unrestricted cash and cash equivalents ongoing cash flows from operations and available borrowings under the variable funding notes to among other things fund working capital requirements invest in our core business and repurchase our common stock we have historically funded our working capital requirements capital expenditures debt repayments and repurchases of common stock primarily from our cash flows from operations and when necessary our available borrowings under variable funding note facilities management believes its current unrestricted cash and cash equivalents balance and its expected ongoing cash flows from operations will be sufficient to fund operations for the foreseeable future 

we generally expect annual capital expenditures of approximately 250 million to 350 million these capital expenditures primarily relate to investments in existing companyowned stores and supply chain centers as well as investments in our proprietary internally developed pointofsale system domino’s pulse™ our digital ordering platform and other technology initiatives all of which we believe are necessary to sustain and grow our business we did not have any material commitments for capital expenditures as of december 30 2012 

  

cash provided by operating activities was 1763 million in 2012 1531 million in 2011 and 1283 million in 2010 the 232 million increase in 2012 versus 2011 was due primarily to a 151 million increase in net income excluding noncash adjustments and an 81 million net change in operating assets and liabilities due primarily to the timing of payments on current operating liabilities and the timing of prepaid expenses the 248 million increase in 2011 versus 2010 was due primarily to a 134 million net change in operating assets and liabilities due primarily to the timing of payments on current operating liabilities and an 114 million increase in net income excluding noncash adjustments we are focused on continually improving our net income and cash flow from operations as noted above we generated 1763 million of cash from our operating activities even after deducting our 293 million of capital expenditures we generated a substantial amount of excess cash in 2012 some of which was deployed on other activities including the special dividend paid from the 2012 recapitalization repurchases of our common stock or similar uses of cash management expects to continue to generate positive cash flows from operating activities for the foreseeable future 

cash provided by investing activities was 73 million in 2012 cash used in investing activities was 269 million in 2011 and 184 million in 2010 the 342 million net change in 2012 versus 2011 was due primarily to a 397 million decrease in restricted cash and cash equivalents due to the company eliminating cash pledged as collateral on its letters of credit in connection with the 2012 recapitalization these letters of credit now reduce the amount of borrowing available under the company’s variable funding notes this was offset in part by a 49 million increase in capital expenditures during 2012 as a result of increased investments in existing companyowned stores and supply chain centers as well as investments in our technology initiatives all of which we believe are necessary to sustain and grow our business the 85 million increase in 2011 versus 2010 was due primarily to a 127 million change in restricted cash and cash equivalents offset in part by a 33 million increase in proceeds from the sale of assets resulting from the sale of certain companyowned operations in 2011 and a 11 million decrease in capital expenditures 

cash used in financing activities was 1774 million in 2012 1235 million in 2011 and 1043 million in 2010 the 539 million increase in 2012 versus 2011 was due primarily to 14 billion of repayments of the 2007 debt facilities 1855 million dividend and equivalent payments a 288 million increase in cash paid for financing costs all of which resulted from our 2012 recapitalization and a 246 million decrease in proceeds from the exercise of stock options these uses of cash for financing activities were offset in part by 16 billion of proceeds from issuance of the 2012 fixed rate notes and a 768 million decrease in purchases of common stock the 192 million increase in 2011 versus 2010 was due primarily to a 1596 million increase in purchases of common stock 38 million cash paid for financing costs in 2011 and a 24 million increase in tax payments for restricted stock these increases were offset in part by a 1159 million decrease in repayments of longterm debt and capital lease obligations a 241 million increase in the proceeds from exercise of stock options and a 135 million increase in the tax impact of our equitybased compensation 

based upon the current level of operations and anticipated growth we believe that the cash generated from operations our current unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and amounts available under the variable funding notes will be more than adequate to meet our anticipated debt service requirements capital expenditures and working capital needs for the foreseeable future our ability to continue to fund these items and continue to reduce debt could be adversely affected by the occurrence of any of the events described in item 1a risk factors there can be no assurance however that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operations or that future borrowings will be available under the variable funding notes or otherwise to enable us to service our indebtedness or to make anticipated capital expenditures our future operating performance and our ability to service extend or refinance the fixed rate notes and to service extend or refinance the variable funding notes will be subject to future economic conditions and to financial business and other factors many of which are beyond our control 

impact of inflation 

we believe that our results of operations are not materially impacted by moderate changes in the inflation rate inflation did not have a material impact on our operations in 2010 2011 or 2012 severe increases in inflation however could affect the global and us economies and could have an adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations further discussion on the impact of commodities and other cost pressures is included above as well as in item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

 item 1 business 

overview 

domino’s pizza inc referred to as the “company” “domino’s” or in the first person notations of “we” “us” and “our” is the number one pizza delivery company in the united states based on reported consumer spending and the second largest pizza company in the world based on number of units and sales on average over one million pizzas are sold each day throughout the domino’s system with deliveries covering approximately ten million miles per week we pioneered the pizza delivery business and have built the domino’s pizza ® brand into one of the most widelyrecognized consumer brands in the world together with our domestic franchisees we have supported the domino’s pizza ® brand with an estimated 14 billion in advertising spending in the united states over the past five years additionally our international franchisees also commit significant dollars in advertising efforts in their markets we operate through a network of 9742 companyowned and franchise stores located in all 50 states and in more than 70 international markets in addition we operate 16 regional dough manufacturing and supply chain centers one equipment and supply facility one thin crust manufacturing center and one vegetable processing center in the contiguous united states and six dough manufacturing and supply chain centers outside the contiguous united states the foundation of our systemwide success and leading market position is our strong relationships with our franchisees comprised of over 2000 owneroperators throughout the world dedicated to the success of the domino’s pizza ® brand 

we celebrated our 50 th anniversary in 2010 and over our 51year history we have developed a simple business model focused on our core strength of delivering quality pizza and other complementary items in a timely manner this business model includes a deliveryoriented store design with low capital requirements a focused menu of pizza and other complementary items committed owneroperator franchisees and a verticallyintegrated supply chain system our earnings are driven largely by retail sales at our franchise stores which generate royalty payments and supply chain revenues to us we also generate earnings through retail sales at our companyowned stores internationally similar dynamics apply however most geographies are granted to a qualified master franchisee and this master franchisee can utilize three potential income streams running corporate stores subfranchising and running supply chain centers 

we operate our business in three segments domestic stores domestic supply chain and international 

 

  

  

 on a consolidated basis we generated revenues of more than 16 billion and income from operations after deducting 606 million of unallocated corporate and other expenses of 2591 million in 2011 net income was 1054 million in 2011 in each of the past three years we have been able to increase our net income grow our global retail sales and in those three years have added nearly 1000 net stores worldwide we were able to grow our business with capital expenditures that generally ranged between 200 million to 300 million on an annualized basis as a significant portion of our earnings are derived from retail sales by our franchisees 

our history 

we have been delivering quality affordable pizza to our customers since 1960 when brothers thomas and james monaghan borrowed 900 and purchased a small pizza store in ypsilanti michigan since that time our store count and geographic reach have grown substantially we opened our first franchise store in 1967 and our first international store in 1983 during 2010 we opened our 9000 th store worldwide and as of january 1 2012 we had 9742 stores worldwide we celebrated the company’s 50 th anniversary on december 9 2010 

  

in 1998 an investor group led by investment funds associated with bain capital llc completed a recapitalization through which the investor group acquired a 93 controlling economic interest in our company from thomas monaghan and his family in 2004 domino’s pizza inc completed its initial public offering the “ipo” and now trades on the new york stock exchange under the ticker symbol “dpz” in connection with the ipo on may 11 2004 we reincorporated in delaware prior to that tism inc the then parent company of the domino’s pizza business was a michigan corporation which operated through its whollyowned subsidiary domino’s pizza llc a michigan limited liability company 

during 2007 the company completed a recapitalization transaction the “2007 recapitalization” primarily consisting of i the issuance of 17 billion of borrowings of fixed rate notes ii the purchase and retirement of all outstanding senior subordinated notes iii the repayment of all outstanding borrowings under its senior credit facility and iv the payment of a special cash dividend to shareholders and related antidilution payments and adjustments to certain stock option holders 

industry overview 

in this document we rely on and refer to information regarding the us quick service restaurant or qsr sector the us qsr pizza category and its components and competitors including us from the crest ® report prepared by the npd group as well as market research reports analyst reports and other publiclyavailable information although we believe this information to be reliable we have not independently verified it domestic sales information relating to the qsr sector us qsr pizza category and us pizza delivery and carryout represent reported consumer spending obtained by the npd group’s crest ® report from consumer surveys this information relates to both our companyowned and franchise stores unless otherwise indicated all us industry data included in this document is based on reported consumer spending obtained by the npd group’s crest ® report from consumer surveys 

the us qsr pizza category is large and fragmented with sales of 324 billion in the twelve months ended november 2011 it is the second largest category within the 2389 billion us qsr sector the us qsr pizza category is primarily comprised of delivery dinein and carryout 

we operate primarily within the us pizza delivery component its 98 billion of sales accounted for approximately 30 of total us qsr pizza category sales in the twelve months ended november 2011 we and our top two competitors account for approximately 51 of us pizza delivery based on reported consumer spending with the remaining 49 attributable to regional chains and individual establishments 

we also compete in the growing carryout component which together with pizza delivery comprise the largest components of the us qsr pizza category us carryout pizza had 143 billion of sales in the twelve months ended november 2011 and while our primary focus is on pizza delivery we are also favorably positioned to compete in carryout given our strong brand convenient store locations and quality affordable menu offerings 

in contrast to the united states international pizza delivery is relatively underdeveloped with only domino’s and one other competitor having a significant global presence we believe that demand for international pizza and pizza delivery is large and growing driven by international consumers’ increasing emphasis on convenience and the proven success of our 28 years of conducting business abroad 

our competitive strengths 

we believe that our competitive strengths include the following 

 

   

  

 in addition we generally share 50 or a higher percentage in the case of companyowned stores and certain franchisees who operate a larger number of stores of the pretax profits generated by our regional dough manufacturing and supply chain centers with those domestic franchisees who agree to purchase all of their food from our supply chain system these arrangements strengthen our ties with our franchisees by enhancing their profitability while providing us with a continuing source of revenues and earnings this arrangement also provides incentives for franchisees to work closely with us to reduce costs we believe our strong mutuallybeneficial franchisee relationships are evidenced by the over 99 voluntary participation in our domestic supply chain system our over 99 domestic franchise contract renewal rate and our over 99 collection rate on domestic franchise royalty and domestic supply chain receivables 

internationally we have been able to grow our franchise network by attracting franchisees with business experience and local market knowledge we generally employ our master franchise model which provides our international franchisees with exclusive rights to operate stores and subfranchise our wellrecognized domino’s pizza ® brand name in specific agreedupon market areas as well as operate their own supply chain systems from yearend 2006 through 2011 we grew our international franchise network 50 from 3223 stores to 4835 stores our largest master franchisee operates 861 stores in five markets which accounts for approximately 18 of our total international store count during 2011 we had 413 net international store openings including 75 net stores in india 58 net stores in turkey and 54 net stores in the united kingdom 

 

 we believe that our store economics have led to a strong welldiversified franchise system this established franchise system has produced strong cash flow and earnings for us which has enabled us to invest in the domino’s pizza ® brand our stores our technology and our supply chain centers pay significant dividends repurchase shares of our common stock repurchase and retire outstanding principal on our fixed rate notes and deliver attractive returns to our stockholders 

 

 outside the united states we have significant market share positions in the key markets in which we compete including the united kingdom mexico australia india south korea canada turkey japan france and taiwan our top ten international markets based on store count accounted for approximately 76 of our international retail sales in 2011 we believe we have a strong presence in each of these markets 

  

 we believe that our brand is particularly strong among pizza consumers for whom a meal is a fairly spontaneous event in these situations we believe that service and product quality are the consumers’ priorities we believe that well established demographic and lifestyle trends will drive continuing emphasis on convenience and will therefore continue to play into our brand’s strength 

 

 in 2011 we made approximately 515000 fullservice food deliveries to our domestic stores or approximately two deliveries per store per week with an ontime delivery performance rate of approximately 94 all of our companyowned and over 99 of our domestic franchise stores purchase all of their food and supplies from us this is accomplished through our network of 16 regional dough manufacturing and supply chain centers each of which is generally located within a oneday delivery radius of the stores it serves and a leased fleet of over 400 tractors and trailers additionally we supply our domestic and international franchisees with equipment and supplies through our equipment and supply center which we operate as part of our domestic supply chain segment offering a full range of nonfood products from ovens to uniforms we also supply certain of our domestic stores with ingredients that are processed at our vegetable processing center and thin crust product that is manufactured at our thin crust manufacturing center both of which we operate as part of our domestic supply chain segment 

because we source the food for substantially all of our domestic stores our domestic supply chain segment enables us to leverage and monitor our strong supplier relationships to achieve the cost benefits of scale and to ensure compliance with our rigorous quality standards in addition the “onestop shop” nature of this system combined with our delivery accuracy allows our store managers to eliminate a significant component of the typical “backofstore” activity that many of our competitors’ store managers must undertake additionally we operate six supply chain centers that service certain of our international franchise markets 

our business strategy 

we intend to achieve further growth and strengthen our competitive position through the continued implementation of our business strategy which includes the following key elements 

 

  

  

  

  

 we adhere to the following guiding principles which are based on the concept of one united brand system and team 

 

  

  

  

  

   

 the carryout component had 143 billion of sales in the twelve months ended november 2011 while our primary focus is on pizza delivery we are also favorably positioned as a leader in the growing carryout component given our strong brand convenient store locations and quality affordable menu offerings 

 

 in 2008 each domestic store contributed 4 of its retail sales to support national advertising in addition to contributions for marketlevel advertising in 2009 domestic stores within active advertising cooperatives elected to allocate an additional 1 of their advertising contributions to support national advertising initiatives which resulted in each domestic store contributing 5 of its retail sales to support national advertising as stores within inactive advertising cooperatives were already contributing 5 of its retail sales to support national advertising also in 2009 all domestic franchisees amended their standard franchise agreements to require a contribution of 55 subject in limited instances to lower rates based on certain incentives and waivers of their retail sales for national advertising and to eliminate the required marketlevel contributions we currently anticipate this 55 contribution rate which took effect in 2010 and continued throughout 2011 to remain in place for the foreseeable future 

we intend to leverage our strong brand by continuing to introduce innovative consumertested and profitable new product varieties such as artisan pizzas oven baked sandwiches domino’s american legends ® pizzas and breadbowl pasta™ complementary side items such as our new stuffed cheesy bread boneless chicken and wings cinna stix ® and chocolate lava crunch cakes and value promotions as well as through marketing affiliations with brands such as cocacola ®  additionally we may from timetotime partner with other organizations in an effort to promote the domino’s pizza ® brand we believe these opportunities when coupled with our scale and share leadership will allow us to grow our position in us pizza delivery 

 

 we believe that pizza has global appeal and that there is strong and growing international demand for delivered pizza we have successfully built a broad international platform primarily through our master franchise model as evidenced by our 4835 international stores in more than 70 international markets we believe that we continue to have significant longterm growth opportunities in international markets where we have established a leading presence in our top ten international markets we believe that our current store base is approximately half of the total longterm potential store base in those markets generally we believe we will achieve longterm growth internationally as a result of the favorable storelevel economics of our business model the growing international demand for pizza and delivered pizza and the strong global recognition of the domino’s pizza ® brand our international stores have produced positive quarterly same store sales growth for 72 consecutive quarters additionally during 2011 we had 413 net international store openings including 75 net stores in india 58 net stores in turkey and 54 net stores in the united kingdom 

  

store operations 

we believe that our focused and proven store model provides a significant competitive advantage relative to many of our competitors who focus on multiple components of the pizza category particularly dinein we have been focused primarily on pizza delivery for over 50 years because our domestic stores and most of our international stores do not offer extensive dinein areas they typically do not require expensive real estate are relatively small and are relatively inexpensive to build and equip our stores also benefit from lower maintenance costs as store assets have long lives and updates are not frequently required our simple and efficient operational processes which we have refined through continuous improvement include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 strategic store locations to facilitate delivery service 

we locate our stores strategically to facilitate timely delivery service to our customers the majority of our domestic stores are located in populated areas in or adjacent to large or midsize cities or on or near college campuses we use geographic information software which incorporates variables such as traffic volumes competitor locations household demographics and visibility to evaluate and identify potential store locations and new markets 

productionoriented store designs 

our typical store is relatively small occupying generally up to 1500 square feet and is designed with a focus on efficient and timely production of consistently high quality food for delivery the store layout has been refined over time to provide an efficient flow from ordertaking to delivery our stores are primarily production facilities and accordingly do not typically have an extensive dinein area 

product and process innovations 

our over 50 years of experience and innovative culture have resulted in numerous new product and process developments that increase both quality and efficiency these include our efficient verticallyintegrated supply chain system a sturdier corrugated pizza box and a mesh screen that helped cook pizza crust more evenly the domino’s heatwave ® hot bag keeps our pizzas hot during delivery we also continue to introduce new products such as domino’s oven baked sandwiches launched in 2008 domino’s american legends ® pizzas and domino’s breadbowl pasta™ both launched in 2009 and improved new boneless chicken and wings domino’s artisan pizzas and stuffed cheesy bread each launched in 2011 additionally we have added a number of complementary side items to our menu such as bread sticks cinna stix ® and chocolate lava crunch cakes in 2009 we introduced our improved pizza recipe which was a change to our core pizza recipe 

focused menu 

we maintain a focused menu that is designed to present an attractive quality offering to customers while minimizing order errors and expediting the order taking and food preparation processes our basic menu has three choices for pizza products pizza type pizza size and pizza toppings most of our stores carry two or three sizes of traditional handtossed pan brooklyn style and crunchy thin crust pizza our typical store also offers domino’s artisan pizzas domino’s american legends ® pizzas domino’s oven baked sandwiches domino’s bread bowl pasta™ boneless chicken and wings bread sticks cinna stix ®  chocolate lava crunch cakes new stuffed cheesy bread and cocacola ® soft drink products we also occasionally offer other products on a promotional or a regional basis such as salads we believe that our focused menu creates a strong identity among consumers improves operating efficiency and maintains food quality and consistency 

  

efficient order taking production and delivery 

each store executes an operational process that includes order taking pizza preparation cooking via automated conveyordriven ovens boxing and delivery the entire order taking and pizza production process is designed for completion in approximately 1215 minutes these operational processes are supplemented by an extensive employee training program designed to ensure worldclass quality and customer service it is our priority to ensure that every domino’s store operates in an efficient consistent manner while maintaining our high standards of food quality and team member safety 

domino’s pulse™ pointofsale system 

our computerized management information systems are designed to improve operating efficiencies provide corporate management with timely access to financial and marketing data and reduce store and corporate administrative time and expense we have installed domino’s pulse™ our proprietary pointofsale system in every companyowned store in the united states and in more than 98 of our domestic franchise stores and in a growing portion of the international stores domino’s pulse™ features include 

 

  

  

  

 we require our domestic franchisees to install and maintain domino’s pulse™ additionally domino’s pulse ™ has been installed in over 2000 international franchise stores management believes that utilizing domino’s pulse™ throughout our domestic system and a growing portion of our global system provides us with competitive advantages over other pointofsales systems including 

 

  

  

  

  

 since the rollout of domino’s pulse ™ to our domestic stores our online ordering transactions have grown currently on average almost onethird of our domestic stores’ sales originate online in 2010 we made the strategic decision to develop our own online ordering platform and manage this important and growing area of our business internally in 2011 we launched a new mobile application for the iphone and ipod touch to provide further convenience for our customers when ordering online we intend to continue to enhance and grow our online ordering capabilities 

comprehensive store operations evaluation program 

we utilize a comprehensive evaluation program to ensure that our stores are meeting both our stringent standards as well as the expectations of our customers the program focuses primarily on the quality of the pizza the store is producing the customer service the store is providing and the condition of the store as viewed by the customer we believe that this program is an integral part of our strategy to maintain high standards in our stores 

segment overview 

we operate in three business segments 

 

  

  

   

domestic stores 

during 2011 our domestic stores segment accounted for 5234 million or nearly 32 of our consolidated revenues our domestic franchises are operated by entrepreneurs who own and operate an average of four stores nine of our domestic franchisees operate more than 50 stores including our largest domestic franchisee who operates 136 stores our principal sources of revenues from domestic store operations are companyowned store sales and royalty payments based on retail sales by our franchisees our domestic network of companyowned stores also plays an important strategic role in our predominantly franchised operating structure in addition to generating revenues and earnings we use our domestic companyowned stores as test sites for new products and promotions as well as store operational improvements and as forums for training new store managers and prospective franchisees we also believe that our domestic companyowned stores add to the economies of scale available for advertising marketing and other costs that are primarily borne by our franchisees while we continue to be primarily a franchised business we continually evaluate our mix of domestic companyowned and franchise stores in an effort to optimize our longterm profitability 

our domestic companyowned store operations are divided into ten geographic areas located throughout the contiguous united states while our domestic franchise operations are divided into four regions our team members within these areas provide direct supervision over our domestic companyowned stores provide training store operational audits and marketing services and provide financial analysis and store development services to our franchisees we maintain a close relationship with our franchise stores through regional franchise teams an array of computerbased training materials that help franchise stores comply with our standards and franchise advisory groups that facilitate communications between us and our franchisees 

domestic supply chain 

during 2011 our domestic supply chain segment accounted for 9279 million or 56 of our consolidated revenues our domestic supply chain segment is comprised primarily of 16 regional dough manufacturing and supply chain centers that manufacture fresh dough on a daily basis and purchase receive store and deliver quality pizzarelated food products and other complementary items to all of our companyowned stores and over 99 of our domestic franchise stores each regional dough manufacturing and supply chain center serves approximately 300 stores generally located within a oneday delivery radius we regularly supply nearly 5000 stores with various supplies and ingredients of which nine product groups account for over 90 of the volume our domestic supply chain segment made approximately 515000 fullservice deliveries in 2011 or approximately two deliveries per store per week and we produced over 304 million pounds of dough during 2011 

we believe that our franchisees voluntarily choose to obtain food supplies and equipment from us because we provide the most efficient convenient and costeffective alternative while also providing both quality and consistency in addition our domestic supply chain segment offers a profitsharing arrangement to stores that purchase all of their food from our domestic dough manufacturing and supply chain centers this profitsharing arrangement generally provides domestic companyowned stores and participating franchisees with 50 or a higher percentage in the case of companyowned stores and certain franchisees who operate a larger number of stores of their regional supply chain center’s pretax profits profits are shared with the franchisees based upon each franchisee’s purchases from our supply chain centers we believe these arrangements strengthen our ties with these franchisees 

the information systems used by our domestic dough manufacturing and supply chain centers are an integral part of the quality service we provide our stores we use routing strategies and software to optimize our daily delivery schedules which maximizes ontime deliveries through our strategic dough manufacturing and supply chain center locations and proven routing systems we achieved an ontime delivery performance rate of over 94 during 2011 our supply chain center drivers unload food and supplies and stock store shelves typically during nonpeak store hours which minimize disruptions in store operations 

international 

during 2011 our international segment accounted for 2009 million or 12 of our consolidated revenues at january 1 2012 we had 4835 international franchise stores the principal sources of revenues from our international operations are royalty payments generated by retail sales from franchise stores and sales of food and supplies to franchisees in certain markets 

  

we have grown by more than 1600 international stores over the past five years during 2011 we had 413 net international store openings including 75 net stores in india 58 net stores in turkey and 54 net stores in the united kingdom our international franchisees adapt our standard operating model within certain parameters to satisfy the local eating habits and consumer preferences of various regions outside the united states currently most of our international stores are operated under master franchise agreements and we plan to continue entering into master franchise agreements with qualified franchisees to expand our international operations in selected countries we believe that our international franchise stores appeal to potential franchisees because of our wellrecognized brand name the limited capital expenditures required to open and operate our stores and our system’s favorable store economics while we had a significant presence in our top ten international markets we believe that these markets contain opportunities for additional growth of the domino’s brand the following table shows our store count as of january 1 2012 in our top ten international markets which account for approximately 75 of our international stores

as of january 1 2012 our 4513 domestic franchise stores were owned and operated by our 1077 domestic franchisees the success of our franchise formula which enables franchisees to benefit from our brand name with a relatively low initial capital investment has attracted a large number of motivated entrepreneurs as franchisees as of january 1 2012 the average domestic franchisee owned and operated four stores and had been in our franchise system for over fourteen years at the same time nine of our domestic franchisees operated more than 50 stores including our largest domestic franchisee who operates 136 stores 

franchisees 

we apply rigorous standards to prospective franchisees we generally require prospective domestic franchisees to manage a store for at least one year before being granted a franchise this enables us to observe the operational and financial performance of a potential franchisee prior to entering into a longterm contract we also generally restrict the ability of domestic franchisees to be involved in other businesses which focuses our franchisees’ attention on operating their stores as a result the vast majority of our domestic franchisees have historically come from within the domino’s pizza system we believe these standards are largely unique to the franchise industry and result in qualified and focused franchisees operating their stores 

franchise agreements 

we enter into franchise agreements with domestic franchisees under which the franchisee is granted the right to operate a store in a particular location for a term of ten years with options to renew for an additional term of ten years we currently have a franchise contract renewal rate of over 99 under the current standard franchise agreement we assign an exclusive area of primary responsibility to each franchise store during the term of the franchise agreement the franchisee is required to pay a 55 royalty fee on sales subject in limited instances to lower rates based on area development agreements sales initiatives and new store incentives we have the contractual right subject to state law to terminate a franchise agreement for a variety of reasons including but not limited to a franchisee’s failure to make required payments when due or failure to adhere to specified company policies and standards 

franchise store development 

we provide domestic franchisees with assistance in selecting store sites and conforming the space to the physical specifications required for a domino’s pizza store each domestic franchisee selects the location and design for each store subject to our approval based on accessibility and visibility of the site and demographic factors including population density and anticipated traffic levels we also sell fixtures and equipment to most of our franchise stores 

  

our international franchise program 

franchisees 

the vast majority of our markets outside of the contiguous united states are operated by master franchisees with franchise and distribution rights for entire regions or countries in a few select regions or countries we franchise directly to individual store operators prospective master franchisees are required to possess or have access to local market knowledge required to establish and develop domino’s pizza stores the local market knowledge focuses on the ability to identify and access targeted real estate sites along with expertise in local customs culture consumer behavior and laws we also seek candidates that have access to sufficient capital to meet growth and development plans 

master franchise agreements 

our master franchise agreements generally grant the franchisee exclusive rights to develop or subfranchise stores and the right to operate supply chain centers in a particular geographic area for a term of 10 to 20 years with options to renew for additional terms the agreements typically contain growth clauses requiring franchisees to open a minimum number of stores within a specified period the master franchisee is generally required to pay an initial onetime franchise fee as well as an additional franchise fee upon the opening of each new store in addition the master franchisee is required to pay a continuing royalty fee as a percentage of retail sales which varies among international markets and averaged approximately 30 in 2011 

franchise training and support 

training store managers and employees is a critical component of our success we require all domestic franchisees to complete initial and ongoing training programs provided by us in addition under the standard domestic franchise agreement domestic franchisees are required to implement training programs for their store employees we assist our domestic and international franchisees by making training materials available to them for their use in training store managers and employees including computerbased training materials comprehensive operations manuals and franchise development classes we also maintain communications with our franchisees online through various newsletters electronic communications and through facetoface meetings 

franchise operations 

we enforce stringent standards over franchise operations to protect the domino’s pizza ® brand all franchisees are required to operate their stores in compliance with written policies standards and specifications which include matters such as menu items ingredients materials supplies services furnishings decor and signs each franchisee has discretion to determine the prices to be charged to customers we also provide ongoing support to our franchisees including training marketing assistance and consultation to franchisees who experience financial or operational difficulties we have established several advisory boards through which franchisees contribute to developing systemwide initiatives 

marketing operations 

in our recent history depending on the fiscal year our domestic stores have contributed 4 or 5 of their retail sales to fund national marketing and advertising campaigns with additional required contributions to marketlevel programs during 2009 all domestic franchisees amended their master franchise agreements to require a contribution of 55 subject in limited instances to lower rates based on certain incentives and waivers of their retail sales to fund national marketing and advertising campaigns and to eliminate the required marketlevel contributions management currently anticipates this 55 contribution rate which began in 2010 and continued in 2011 will remain in place for the foreseeable future in those markets where we have cooperative advertising programs our domestic stores are still able to contribute to marketlevel media campaigns at their discretion these national and marketlevel funds are administered by domino’s national advertising fund inc or dnaf our notforprofit advertising subsidiary the funds remitted to dnaf are used primarily to purchase media for advertising but also support market research field communications public relations commercial production talent payments and other activities supporting the domino’s pizza ® brand dnaf also provides costeffective print materials to our domestic stores for use in local marketing that reinforce our national branding strategy in addition to the national and marketlevel advertising contributions domestic stores spend additional amounts on local store marketing including targeted database mailings saturation print mailings and community involvement through school and civic organizations additionally we may from timetotime partner with other organizations in an effort to promote the domino’s pizza ® brand 

  

by communicating a common brand message at the national local market and store levels we create and reinforce a powerful consistent marketing message to consumers this is evidenced by our successful marketing campaign with the slogan “oh yes we did” since introducing our improved pizza recipe and this new marketing campaign in the fourth quarter of 2009 we have received significant attention in the news media social networking internet sites and other media outlets and have experienced positive same store sales growth in our domestic stores additionally in may 2011 pizza today  the leading publication of the pizza industry named domino’s its “chain of the year” for the second straight year – making the company a threetime overall winner of the honor and the first pizza delivery company to receive the honor in backtoback years over the past five years we estimate that domestic stores have invested approximately 14 billion on national local and cooperative advertising in the united states 

internationally marketing efforts are the responsibility of the franchisee in each local market we assist international franchisees with their marketing efforts through marketing workshops and knowledge sharing of best practices and successful concepts 

thirdparty suppliers 

we have maintained active relationships of 20 years or more with more than half of our major thirdparty suppliers our thirdparty suppliers are required to meet strict quality standards to ensure food safety we review and evaluate our thirdparty suppliers’ quality assurance programs through among other actions onsite visits third party audits and product evaluations to ensure compliance with our standards we believe that the length and quality of our relationships with thirdparty suppliers provides us with priority service and quality products at competitive prices 

we believe that two factors have been critical to maintaining longlasting relationships and keeping our purchasing costs low first we are one of the largest domestic volume purchasers of pizzarelated products such as flour cheese sauce and pizza boxes which allows us to maximize leverage with our thirdparty suppliers when items are put out for bid on a scheduled basis second we use a combination of singlesource and multisource procurement strategies each supply category is evaluated along a number of criteria including value of purchasing leverage consistency of quality and reliability of supply to determine the appropriate number of thirdparty suppliers 

we currently purchase our pizza cheese from a single supplier under the arrangement with this supplier the supplier agreed to provide an uninterrupted supply of cheese and the company agreed to a fiveyear pricing period during which it agreed to purchase all of its primary pizza cheese for the company’s domestic stores from this supplier or alternatively pay to the supplier an amount reflecting any benefit previously received by the company under the new pricing terms the pricing schedule is directly correlated to the chicago mercantile exchange cme block cheddar price the majority of our meat toppings come from a single supplier under a contract that began in november 2010 and expires in october 2013 we have the right to terminate these arrangements for quality failures and for uncured breaches 

we believe that alternative thirdparty suppliers for all of these ingredients are available and all of our pizza boxes sauces and other ingredients are sourced from various thirdparty suppliers while we may incur additional costs if we are required to replace any of our thirdparty suppliers we do not believe that such additional costs would have a material adverse effect on our business we also entered into a multiyear agreement with cocacola effective january 1 2003 for the contiguous united states the contract provides for cocacola to be our exclusive beverage supplier and expires at such time as a minimum number of cases of cocacola ® products are purchased by us we continually evaluate each supply category to determine the optimal sourcing strategy 

we have not experienced any significant shortages of supplies or any delays in receiving our food or beverage inventories restaurant supplies or products prices charged to us by our thirdparty suppliers are subject to fluctuation and we have historically been able to pass increased costs and savings on to our stores we periodically enter into supplier contracts and infrequently utilize financial instruments to manage the risk from changes in commodity prices we do not engage in speculative transactions nor do we hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes 

competition 

us and international pizza delivery and carryout are highly competitive domestically we compete against regional and local companies as well as national chains pizza hut ®  papa john’s ® and little caesars pizza ®  internationally we compete primarily against pizza hut ® and countryspecific national and local companies we generally compete on the basis of product quality location image service and price we also compete on a broader scale with quick service and other international national regional and local restaurants in addition the overall food service industry and the qsr sector in particular are intensely competitive with respect to product quality price service convenience and concept the industry is often affected by changes in consumer tastes economic conditions demographic trends and consumers’ disposable income we compete within the food service industry and the qsr sector not only for customers but also for personnel suitable real estate sites and qualified franchisees 

  

government regulation 

we are subject to various federal state and local laws affecting the operation of our business as are our franchisees including various health sanitation fire and safety standards each store is subject to licensing and regulation by a number of governmental authorities which include zoning health safety sanitation building and fire agencies in the jurisdiction in which the store is located in connection with maintaining our stores we may be required to expend funds to meet certain federal state and local regulations including regulations requiring that remodeled or altered stores be accessible to persons with disabilities difficulties in obtaining or the failure to obtain required licenses or approvals could delay or prevent the opening of a new store in a particular area or cause an existing store to cease operations our supply chain facilities are also licensed and subject to similar regulations by federal state and local health and fire codes 

we are also subject to the fair labor standards act and various other federal and state laws governing such matters as minimum wage requirements overtime and other working conditions and citizenship requirements a significant number of our food service personnel are paid at rates related to the applicable minimum wage and past increases in the minimum wage have increased our labor costs as would future increases 

we are subject to the rules and regulations of the federal trade commission and various state laws regulating the offer and sale of franchises the federal trade commission and various state laws require that we furnish a franchise disclosure document containing certain information to prospective franchisees and a number of states require registration of the franchise disclosure document with state authorities we are operating under exemptions from registration in several states based on the net worth of our operating subsidiary domino’s pizza llc and experience substantive state laws that regulate the franchisorfranchisee relationship presently exist in a substantial number of states and bills have been introduced in congress from time to time that would provide for federal regulation of the franchisorfranchisee relationship the state laws often limit among other things the duration and scope of noncompetition provisions the ability of a franchisor to terminate or refuse to renew a franchise and the ability of a franchisor to designate sources of supply we believe that our franchise disclosure document together with any applicable state versions or supplements and franchising procedures comply in all material respects with both the federal trade commission guidelines and all applicable state laws regulating franchising in those states in which we have offered franchises 

internationally our franchise stores are subject to national and local laws and regulations that often are similar to those affecting our domestic stores including laws and regulations concerning franchises labor health sanitation and safety our international stores are also often subject to tariffs and regulations on imported commodities and equipment and laws regulating foreign investment we believe that our international disclosure statements franchise offering documents and franchising procedures comply in all material respects with the laws of the foreign countries in which we have offered franchises 

privacy and data protection 

we are subject to a number of privacy and data protection laws and regulations globally the legislative and regulatory landscape for privacy and data protection continues to evolve and there has been an increasing attention to privacy and data protection issues with the potential to affect directly our business including recently enacted laws and regulations in the united states and internationally requiring notification to individuals and government authorities of security breaches involving certain categories of personal information we have a privacy policy posted on our website at wwwdominoscom and believe that we are in material compliance therewith 

trademarks

environmental matters 

we are not aware of any federal state or local environmental laws or regulations that will materially affect our earnings or competitive position or result in material capital expenditures however we cannot predict the effect of possible future environmental legislation or regulations during 2011 there were no material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities and no such material expenditures are anticipated in 2012 

  

employees

safety 

our commitment to safety is embodied in our hiring training and review process before an applicant is considered for hire as a delivery driver in the united states motor vehicle records are reviewed to ensure a minimum safe driving record of one or two years in addition we require regular checks of driving records and proof of insurance for delivery drivers throughout their employment with us each domestic domino’s driver including drivers employed by franchisees are required to complete our safe delivery training program we have also implemented several safe driving incentive programs 

our safety and security department oversees security matters for our domestic companyowned stores regional security and safety directors oversee security measures at domestic companyowned store locations and assist local authorities in investigations of incidents involving our stores or personnel

 item 1a risk factors 

the quick service restaurant pizza category is highly competitive and such competition could adversely affect our operating results 

we compete in the united states against three national chains as well as many regional and local businesses we could experience increased competition from existing or new companies in the pizza category which could create increasing pressures to grow our business in order to maintain our market share if we are unable to maintain our competitive position we could experience downward pressure on prices lower demand for our products reduced margins the inability to take advantage of new business opportunities and the loss of market share all of which would have an adverse effect on our operating results and could cause our stock price to decline 

we also compete on a broader scale with quick service and other international national regional and local restaurants the overall food service market and the quick service restaurant sector are intensely competitive with respect to food quality price service image convenience and concept and are often affected by changes in 

 

  

  

  

  

 we compete within the food service market and the quick service restaurant sector not only for customers but also for management and hourly employees suitable real estate sites and qualified franchisees our domestic supply chain segment is also subject to competition from outside suppliers while over 99 of domestic franchisees purchased food equipment and supplies from us in 2011 domestic franchisees are not required to purchase food equipment or supplies from us and they may choose to purchase from outside suppliers if other suppliers who meet our qualification standards were to offer lower prices or better service to our franchisees for their ingredients and supplies and as a result our franchisees chose not to purchase from our domestic supply chain centers our financial condition business and results of operations would be adversely affected 

if we fail to successfully implement our growth strategy which includes opening new domestic and international stores our ability to increase our revenues and operating profits could be adversely affected 

a significant component of our growth strategy includes the opening of new domestic and international stores we and our franchisees face many challenges in opening new stores including among others 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 the opening of additional franchise stores also depends in part upon the availability of prospective franchisees who meet our criteria our failure to add a significant number of new stores would adversely affect our ability to increase revenues and operating income 

  

we are currently planning to expand our international operations in many of the markets where we currently operate and in selected new markets this may require considerable management time as well as startup expenses for market development before any significant revenues and earnings are generated operations in new foreign markets may achieve low margins or may be unprofitable and expansion in existing markets may be affected by local economic and market conditions therefore as we expand internationally we or our franchisees may not experience the operating margins we expect our results of operations may be negatively impacted and our common stock price may decline 

we may also pursue strategic acquisitions as part of our business if we are able to identify acquisition candidates such acquisitions may be financed to the extent permitted under our debt agreements with substantial debt or with potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities 

the food service market is affected by consumer preferences and perceptions changes in these preferences and perceptions may lessen the demand for our products which would reduce sales and harm our business 

food service businesses are affected by changes in consumer tastes international national regional and local economic conditions and demographic trends for instance if prevailing health or dietary preferences cause consumers to avoid pizza and other products we offer in favor of foods that are perceived as more healthy our business and operating results would be harmed moreover because we are primarily dependent on a single product if consumer demand for pizza should decrease our business would suffer more than if we had a more diversified menu as many other food service businesses do 

reports of foodborne illness or food tampering could reduce sales and harm our business 

reports whether true or not of foodborne illnesses such as e coli avian flu bovine spongiform encephalopathy hepatitis a trichinosis or salmonella and injuries caused by food tampering have in the past severely injured the reputations of participants in the qsr sector and could in the future as well the potential for acts of terrorism on our nation’s food supply also exists and if such an event occurs it could have a negative impact on us and could severely hurt sales revenues and profits in addition our reputation is an important asset as a result anything that damages our reputation could immediately and severely affect our sales revenue and profits media reports of illnesses and injuries whether accurate or not could force some stores to close or otherwise reduce sales at such stores in addition reports of foodborne illnesses or food tampering even those occurring solely at the restaurants of competitors could by resulting in negative publicity about the restaurant industry adversely affect us on a local regional national or international basis 

increases in food labor and other costs could adversely affect our profitability and operating results 

an increase in our operating costs could adversely affect our profitability factors such as inflation increased food costs increased labor and employee benefit costs increased rent costs and increased energy costs may adversely affect our operating costs most of the factors affecting costs are beyond our control and in many cases we may not be able to pass along these increased costs to our customers or franchisees most ingredients used in our pizza particularly cheese are subject to significant price fluctuations as a result of seasonality weather demand and other factors the cheese block price per pound averaged 180 in 2011 and the estimated increase in companyowned store food costs from a hypothetical 025 adverse change in the average cheese block price per pound would have been approximately 21 million in 2011 labor costs are largely a function of the minimum wage for a majority of our store personnel and certain supply chain center personnel and generally are also a function of the availability of labor food including cheese costs and labor represent approximately 50 to 60 of a typical companyowned store’s sales 

we do not have longterm contracts with certain of our suppliers and as a result they could seek to significantly increase prices or fail to deliver 

we do not have written contracts or formal longterm arrangements with certain of our suppliers although in the past we have not experienced significant problems with our suppliers our suppliers may implement significant price increases or may not meet our requirements in a timely fashion or at all the occurrence of any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

shortages or interruptions in the supply or delivery of fresh food products could adversely affect our operating results 

we and our franchisees are dependent on frequent deliveries of fresh food products that meet our specifications shortages or interruptions in the supply of fresh food products caused by unanticipated demand problems in production or distribution financial or other difficulties of suppliers inclement weather or other conditions could adversely affect the availability quality and cost of ingredients which would adversely affect our operating results 

  

any prolonged disruption in the operations of any of our dough manufacturing and supply chain centers could harm our business 

we operate 16 regional dough manufacturing and supply chain centers one thin crust manufacturing center and one vegetable processing center in the contiguous united states and a total of six dough manufacturing and supply chain centers in alaska hawaii and canada our domestic dough manufacturing and supply chain centers service all of our companyowned stores and over 99 of our domestic franchise stores as a result any prolonged disruption in the operations of any of these facilities whether due to technical or labor difficulties destruction or damage to the facility real estate issues or other reasons could adversely affect our business and operating results 

we face risks of litigation and negative publicity from customers franchisees employees and others in the ordinary course of business which diverts our financial and management resources any adverse litigation or publicity may negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations 

claims of illness or injury relating to food quality or food handling are common in the food service industry and vehicular accidents and injuries occur in the food delivery business in addition class action lawsuits have been filed and may continue to be filed against various quick service restaurants alleging among other things that quick service restaurants have failed to disclose the health risks associated with highfat foods and that quick service restaurant marketing practices have encouraged obesity in addition to decreasing our sales and profitability and diverting our management resources adverse publicity or a substantial judgment against us could negatively impact our financial condition results of operations and brand reputation thereby hindering our ability to attract and retain franchisees and grow our business 

further we may be subject to employee franchisee and other claims in the future based on among other things discrimination harassment wrongful termination and wage rest break and meal break issues and those claims relating to overtime compensation we have been subject to these types of claims in the past if one or more of these claims were to be successful or if there is a significant increase in the number of these claims or if we receive significant negative publicity our business financial condition and operating results could be harmed 

loss of key personnel or our inability to attract and retain new qualified personnel could hurt our business and inhibit our ability to operate and grow successfully 

our success in the highly competitive business of pizza delivery will continue to depend to a significant extent on our leadership team and other key management personnel other than with our president and chief executive officer j patrick doyle we do not have longterm employment agreements with any of our executive officers as a result we may not be able to retain our executive officers and key personnel or attract additional qualified management while we do not have longterm employment agreements with our executive officers for all of our executive officers we have noncompete and nonsolicitation agreements that extend for 24 months following the termination of such executive officer’s employment our success also will continue to depend on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel to operate our stores dough manufacturing and supply chain centers and international operations the loss of these employees or our inability to recruit and retain qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 

our international operations subject us to additional risk such risks and costs may differ in each country in which we and our franchisees do business and may cause our profitability to decline due to increased costs 

we conduct a growing portion of our business outside the united states our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected if global markets in which our franchise stores compete are affected by changes in political economic or other factors these factors over which neither we nor our franchisees have control may include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

adverse economic conditions and the global debt crisis subject us to additional risk 

our financial condition and results of operations are impacted by global markets and economic conditions over which neither we nor our franchisees have control an economic downturn may result in a reduction in the demand for our products longer payment cycles slower adoption of new technologies and increased price competition poor economic conditions may adversely affect the ability of our franchisees to pay royalties or amounts owed and could have a material adverse impact on our ability to pursue our growth strategy which would reduce cash collections and in turn may materially and adversely affect our ability to service our debt obligations 

the ongoing deterioration of the sovereign debt of several european countries together with the risk of contagion to other more stable countries has exacerbated the global economic crisis despite taking various measures including the creation of the european financial stability fund by the european commission and the allocation of funds to affected countries concerns persist regarding the debt burden of these countries and their ability to meet future financial obligations the european debt crisis has also raised concerns over the overall stability of the euro and the suitability of the euro as a single currency given the diverse economic and political circumstances among countries that use the euro as their currency these concerns could lead to the reintroduction of individual currencies in one or more of these countries or in more extreme circumstances the possible dissolution of the euro currency entirely should the euro dissolve entirely the legal and contractual consequences for holders of euro denominated obligations would be determined by laws in effect at such time as of january 1 2012 we had 1499 stores in europe up from 871 in 2007 the potential developments in europe or market perceptions concerning these and related issues could adversely affect the value of our earnings generated by such stores 

as part of the reforms to resolve the european debt crisis some european countries have adopted or may adopt austerity measures in terms of fiscal policy which could negatively impact employment consumer confidence and household disposable income resulting in reduced consumer expenditures for our products such austerity measures could also adversely affect the ability of third party suppliers to meet our requirements in a timely fashion or at all there can be no assurance that any such austerity measures will be successful or that future assistance packages will be available or even if provided will be sufficient to stabilize the affected countries and markets in europe or elsewhere 

nations outside of the european union also face significant debt burdens which have the potential to negatively impact the global economy on august 5 2011 standard  poors lowered its long term sovereign credit rating on the united states of america from aaa to aa while us lawmakers had reached agreement to raise the federal debt ceiling on august 2 2011 the downgrade reflected standard  poors view that such agreement had fallen short of what would be necessary to stabilize the us governments medium term debt dynamics this downgrade along with market concerns about possible further downgrades and about the governments credit in general could have a material adverse impact on financial markets and economic conditions in the united states and throughout the world 

fluctuations in the value of the us dollar in relation to other currencies may lead to lower revenues and earnings 

exchange rate fluctuations could have an adverse effect on our results of operations approximately 105 of our total revenues in 2009 112 of our total revenues in 2010 and 122 of our revenues in 2011 were derived from our international segment a majority of which were denominated in foreign currencies sales made by franchise stores outside the united states are denominated in the currency of the country in which the store is located and this currency could become less valuable in us dollars as a result of exchange rate fluctuations unfavorable currency fluctuations could lead to increased prices to customers outside the united states or lower profitability to our franchisees outside the united states or could result in lower revenues for us on a us dollar basis from such customers and franchisees a hypothetical 10 adverse change in the foreign currency rates in each of our top ten international markets based on store count would have resulted in a negative impact on revenues of approximately 80 million in 2011 

  

we may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property which could harm the value of our brand and branded products and adversely affect our business 

we depend in large part on our brand and branded products and believe that they are very important to our business we rely on a combination of trademarks copyrights service marks trade secrets and similar intellectual property rights to protect our brand and branded products the success of our business depends on our continued ability to use our existing trademarks and service marks in order to increase brand awareness and further develop our branded products in both domestic and international markets we have registered certain trademarks and have other trademark registrations pending in the united states and foreign jurisdictions not all of the trademarks that we currently use have been registered in all of the countries in which we do business and they may never be registered in all of these countries we may not be able to adequately protect our trademarks and our use of these trademarks may result in liability for trademark infringement trademark dilution or unfair competition all of the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property in the united states and in foreign countries may not be adequate in addition the laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states further through acquisitions of third parties we may acquire brands and related trademarks that are subject to the same risks as the brands and trademarks we currently own 

we may from time to time be required to institute litigation to enforce our trademarks or other intellectual property rights or to protect our trade secrets such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could negatively affect our sales profitability and prospects regardless of whether we are able to successfully enforce our rights 

our earnings and business growth strategy depends on the success of our franchisees and we may be harmed by actions taken by our franchisees or employees of our franchisees that are outside of our control 

a significant portion of our earnings comes from royalties generated by our franchise stores franchisees are independent operators and their employees are not our employees we provide limited training and support to franchisees but the quality of franchise store operations may be diminished by any number of factors beyond our control consequently franchisees may not successfully operate stores in a manner consistent with our standards and requirements or may not hire and train qualified managers and other store personnel if they do not our image and reputation may suffer and as a result our revenues and stock price could decline while we try to ensure that our franchisees maintain the quality of our brand and branded products our franchisees may take actions that adversely affect the value of our intellectual property or reputation as of january 1 2012 we had 1077 domestic franchisees operating 4513 domestic stores nine of these franchisees each operate over 50 domestic stores including our largest domestic franchisee who operates 136 stores and the average franchisee owns and operates four stores in addition our international master franchisees are generally responsible for the development of significantly more stores than our domestic franchisees as a result our international operations are more closely tied to the success of a smaller number of franchisees than our domestic operations our largest international master franchisee operates 861 stores in five markets which accounts for approximately 18 of our total international store count our domestic and international franchisees may not operate their franchises successfully if one or more of our key franchisees were to become insolvent or otherwise were unable or unwilling to pay us our royalties or other amounts owed our business and results of operations would be adversely affected 

interruption failure or compromise of our information technology communications systems and electronic data could hurt our ability to effectively serve our customers and protect customer data which could damage our reputation and adversely affect our business and operating results 

an increasingly significant portion of our retail sales depends on the continuing operation of our information technology and communications systems including but not limited to domino’s pulse™ our online ordering platform and our credit card processing systems our information technology communication systems and electronic data may be vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes terrorist attacks floods fires power loss telecommunications failures computer viruses loss of data unauthorized data breaches or other attempts to harm our systems additionally we operate data centers that are also subject to breakins sabotage and intentional acts of vandalism that could cause disruptions in our ability to serve our customers and protect customer data some of our systems are not fully redundant and our disaster recovery planning cannot account for all eventualities the occurrence of a natural disaster intentional sabotage or other unanticipated problems could result in lengthy interruptions in our service any errors or vulnerabilities in our systems or damage to or failure of our systems could result in interruptions in our services and noncompliance with certain regulations which could reduce our revenues and profits and damage our business and brand 

  

we are subject to extensive government regulation and requirements issued by other groups and our failure to comply with existing or increased regulations could adversely affect our business and operating results 

we are subject to numerous federal state local and foreign laws and regulations as well as requirements issued by other groups including those relating to 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 we may become subject to legislation or regulation seeking to tax andor regulate highfat foods or foods otherwise deemed to be “unhealthy” if we fail to comply with existing or future laws and regulations we may be subject to governmental or judicial fines or sanctions in addition our capital expenditures could increase due to remediation measures that may be required if we are found to be noncompliant with any of these laws or regulations 

we are also subject to a federal trade commission rule and to various state and foreign laws that govern the offer and sale of franchises additionally these laws regulate various aspects of the franchise relationship including terminations and the refusal to renew franchises the failure to comply with these laws and regulations in any jurisdiction or to obtain required government approvals could result in a ban or temporary suspension on future franchise sales fines or other penalties or require us to make offers of rescission or restitution any of which could adversely affect our business and operating results 

our current insurance coverage may not be adequate insurance premiums for such coverage may increase and we may not be able to obtain insurance at acceptable rates or at all 

we have retention programs for workers’ compensation general liability and owned and nonowned automobile liabilities we are generally responsible for up to 10 million per occurrence under these retention programs for workers’ compensation and general liability we are also generally responsible for between 500000 and 30 million per occurrence under these retention programs for owned and nonowned automobile liabilities total insurance limits under these retention programs vary depending upon the period covered and range up to 1100 million per occurrence for general liability and owned and nonowned automobile liabilities and up to the applicable statutory limits for workers’ compensation these insurance policies may not be adequate to protect us from liabilities that we incur in our business in addition in the future our insurance premiums may increase and we may not be able to obtain similar levels of insurance on reasonable terms or at all any such inadequacy of or inability to obtain insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations we are not required to and do not specifically set aside funds for our retention programs 

our annual and quarterly financial results are subject to significant fluctuations depending on various factors many of which are beyond our control and if we fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors our share price may decline significantly 

our sales and operating results can vary significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year depending on various factors many of which are beyond our control these factors include among other things 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 as a result our operational performance may decline quickly and significantly in response to changes in order patterns or rapid decreases in demand for our products we anticipate that fluctuations in operating results will continue in the future 

  

our common stock price could be subject to significant fluctuations andor may decline 

the market price of our common stock could be subject to significant fluctuations among the factors that could affect our stock price are 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 the stock markets in general have recently experienced volatility that has sometimes been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies these broad market fluctuations may cause the trading price of our common stock to decline 

our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our business and limit our ability to plan for or respond to changes in our business 

as a result of the 2007 recapitalization we hold a substantial amount of indebtedness and are highly leveraged as of january 1 2012 our consolidated longterm indebtedness was approximately 145 billion we may also incur additional debt which would not be prohibited under the terms of the securitized debt agreements our substantial indebtedness could have important consequences to our business and our shareholders for example it could 

 

  

  

  

 in addition the financial and other covenants we agreed to with our lenders may limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness make investments pay dividends and engage in other transactions and the leverage may cause potential lenders to be less willing to loan funds to us in the future our failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default that if not cured or waived could result in the acceleration of repayment of all of our indebtedness 

we may be unable to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our significant debt service obligations which would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

our ability to make principal and interest payments on and to refinance our indebtedness will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future this to a certain extent is subject to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control if our business does not generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the amounts projected or at all or if future borrowings are not available to us under our variable funding notes in amounts sufficient to fund our other liquidity needs our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected if we cannot generate sufficient cash flow from operations to make scheduled principal and interest payments on our debt obligations in the future we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity sell assets delay capital expenditures or seek additional equity if we are unable to refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all or to effect any other action relating to our indebtedness on satisfactory terms or at all our business may be harmed 

  

the terms of our securitized debt financing of certain of our whollyowned subsidiaries have restrictive terms and our failure to comply with any of these terms could put us in default which would have an adverse effect on our business and prospects 

unless and until we repay all outstanding borrowings under our securitized debt we will remain subject to the restrictive terms of these borrowings the securitized debt under which certain of our whollyowned subsidiaries issued and guaranteed senior and subordinated fixed rate notes and variable funding senior revolving notes contain a number of covenants with the most significant financial covenant being a debt service coverage calculation these covenants limit the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to among other things 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 the securitized debt also requires us to maintain a specified financial ratio at the end of each fiscal quarter these restrictions could affect our ability to pay dividends or repurchase shares of our common stock our ability to meet this financial ratio can be affected by events beyond our control and we may not satisfy such a test a breach of this covenant could result in a rapid amortization event or default under the securitized debt if amounts owed under the securitized debt are accelerated because of a default under the securitized debt and we are unable to pay such amounts the insurers have the right to assume control of substantially all of the securitized assets 

in the event that one or both of the insurance companies that provide financial guaranties of our fixed and variable funding note payments were to become the subject of insolvency or similar proceedings our lenders would not be required to fund our variable funding notes additionally under the terms of our indenture governing our notes an event of default would occur if i one or both of the insurance companies were to become the subject of insolvency or similar proceedings and ii the related insurance policies were not continued or sold to a third party who would assume one or both of the insurance companies’ obligations under the related policies but instead were terminated or canceled as a result of those proceedings in an event of default all unpaid amounts under the fixed and variable rate notes could become immediately due and payable at the direction or consent of holders of a majority of the outstanding fixed rate notes or the remaining insurance company that is not the subject of insolvency or similar proceedings such acceleration of our debt could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity if we were unable to negotiate mutually acceptable terms with our lenders or if alternate funding were not available to us 

during the first five years following issuance the senior notes will accrue interest at a fixed rate of 5261 per year and the subordinated notes will accrue interest at a fixed rate of 7629 if we are not able to exercise either of our two oneyear extension options following the fiveyear interestonly period our securitized debt will be subject to principal amortization and may also be subject to an increased interest rate if it is not repaid or refinanced if we do exercise one or both extensions we will be subject to an increased interest rate of at least 025 

if we are unable to refinance or repay amounts under the securitized debt prior to the expiration of the fiveyear interestonly term six or sevenyear interestonly term if we satisfy certain conditions and exercise one or both of our oneyear extension elections our cash flow would be directed to the repayment of the securitized debt and other than a weekly servicing fee sufficient to cover minimal selling general and administrative expenses would not be available for operating our business 

no assurance can be given that any refinancing or additional financing will be possible when needed or that we will be able to negotiate acceptable terms in addition our access to capital is affected by prevailing conditions in the financial and capital markets and other factors beyond our control there can be no assurance that market conditions will be favorable at the times that we require new or additional financing 

the indenture governing the securitized debt will restrict the cash flow from the entities subject to the securitization to any of our other entities and upon the occurrence of certain events cash flow would be further restricted 

in the event that a rapid amortization event occurs under the indenture including without limitation upon an event of default under the indenture or the failure to repay the securitized debt at the end of the five year interestonly period or at the end of any extension period the funds available to us would be reduced or eliminated which would in turn reduce our ability to operate or grow our business

 item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

overview 

our fiscal year typically includes 52 weeks comprised of three twelveweek quarters and one sixteenweek quarter every five or six years our fiscal year includes an extra or 53 rd  week in the fourth quarter fiscal 2009 consisted of 53 weeks while fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2011 consisted of 52 weeks 

description of the business 

we are the number one pizza delivery company in the united states with a 226 share of the pizza delivery market based on reported consumer spending and the second largest pizza company in the world based on number of units we also have a leading international presence we operate through a network of 394 companyowned stores all of which are in the united states and 9348 franchise stores located in all 50 states and in more than 70 international markets in addition we operate 16 regional dough manufacturing and supply chain centers in the contiguous united states as well as six dough manufacturing and supply chain centers outside the contiguous united states 

our financial results are driven largely by retail sales at our franchise and companyowned stores changes in retail sales are driven by changes in same store sales and store counts we monitor both of these metrics very closely as they directly impact our revenues and profits and strive to consistently increase both same store sales and our store counts retail sales drive royalty payments from franchisees as well as companyowned store and supply chain revenues retail sales are primarily impacted by the strength of the domino’s pizza ® brand the results of our marketing promotions our ability to execute our store operating model the overall global economic environment and the success of our business strategies 

we devote significant attention to our brandbuilding efforts which is evident in our system’s estimated 14 billion of domestic advertising spending over the past five years and our frequent designation as a megabrand by advertising age  we plan on continuing to build our brand and retail sales by satisfying customers worldwide with our pizza delivery offerings and by continuing to invest significant amounts in the advertising and marketing of the domino’s pizza ® brand in 2011 pizza today  the leading publication of the pizza industry named domino’s its “chain of the year” for the second straight year – making the company a threetime overall winner of the honor and the first pizza delivery company to receive the honor in backtoback years 

we also pay particular attention to the store economics or the investment performance of a store to its owner of both our franchise and companyowned stores we believe that our system’s favorable store economics benefit from the relatively small initial and ongoing investments required to own and operate a domino’s pizza store we believe these favorable investment requirements coupled with a strong brand message supported by significant advertising spending as well as highquality and focused menu offerings drive strong store economics which in turn drive demand for new stores 

business performance 

during 2011 the company continued to produce strong results both domestically and internationally during fiscal 2011 domestic same store sales rose 35 which was rolling over a very strong 99 same store sales growth in 2010 the results in 2011 demonstrate sustained improvement in our domestic business due to higher customer satisfaction retention and purchase frequency over the past several years our focus domestically has been improving our company through several initiatives including investments to improve upon our menu marketing technology operations and franchise base our menu improvements included launching new product platforms in the united states such as our improved pizza recipe launched in late 2009 domino’s oven baked sandwiches domino’s american legends ® pizzas domino’s breadbowl pasta™ chocolate lava crunch cakes and in 2011 our improved boneless chicken and wings domino’s artisan pizzas and our new stuffed cheesy bread we believe our new product platforms combined with an innovative transparent and effective advertising campaign continued focus on operational excellence and new technology such as the launch of our iphone and ipod touch mobile applications in 2011 generated strong sales and earnings growth for the company in both 2010 and 2011 

our international division continued to post strong same store sales growth 68 in 2011 and had a record 413 net store openings including 75 net stores in india 58 net stores in turkey and 54 net stores in the united kingdom continued strong same store sales growth combined with continued store count growth demonstrate the consistency and reliability of this growing business segment 

  

these strong results from both our domestic and international stores produced earnings per share growth and increased cash flows in 2011 we believe that our franchise business model continues to provide a solid structure on which to build consistent retail sales and store growth that results in strong cash flows that we can deploy to drive shareholder value 

in 2011 global retail sales which are total retail sales at companyowned and franchise stores worldwide increased 110 as compared to 2010 retail sales for franchise stores are reported to the company by its franchisees and are not included in company revenues this increase was driven primarily by both domestic and international same store sales growth as well as an increase in our worldwide store counts during the trailing four quarters and the positive impact of foreign currency exchange rates on our international sales domestic same store sales growth reflected the sustained improvement in our domestic business due to the continued success of our new products and promotions international same store sales growth reflected continued strong performance in the markets where we compete in 2010 global retail sales increased 114 as compared to 2009 driven primarily by both domestic and international same store sales growth growth in worldwide store counts and to a lesser extent the positive impact of foreign currency exchange rates on our international sales these increases were offset in part by the inclusion of the 53 rd week in 2009 which benefited global retail sales by 25 percentage points in 2009 

our revenues increased 813 million or 52 in 2011 and increased 1668 million or 119 in 2010 the increase in revenues in 2011 was driven primarily by higher domestic supply chain revenues resulting from higher cheese and other commodity prices and higher international revenues attributable to same store sales store count growth and the positive impact of foreign currency exchange rates additionally domestic franchise revenues were higher due to an increase in domestic same store sales and fees paid by franchisees related to the insourcing of certain services such as online ordering and a call center we also incurred an increase in general and administrative expenses for these services paid by franchisees these increases were offset in part by lower companyowned store revenues resulting from the sale of 58 companyowned stores to multiple franchisees during 2011 the increase in revenues in 2010 was driven by higher domestic supply chain revenues resulting from increased volumes and higher commodity prices including cheese higher same store sales domestically and abroad and international store count growth these increases in 2010 were offset in part by the inclusion of the 53rd week in 2009 which benefited revenues by 344 million in 2009 

worldwide store counts have increased from 8773 at the beginning of 2009 to 9742 at the end of 2011 this growth in store counts can be attributed to the global growth of our brand and our pizza delivery concept as well as the economics inherent in our system which attract new franchisees and encourage existing franchisees to grow their business domestic same store sales increased 05 in 2009 99 in 2010 and 35 in 2011 the increase in domestic same store sales during 2011 demonstrates that our products and promotions continue to resonate with consumers including the launch of two improved chicken products boneless chicken and wings and the domino’s artisan pizzas the significant increase in domestic same store sales in 2010 was attributable to our innovative and effective advertising campaign for our improved pizza recipe continued focus on operational excellence and efforts to strengthen our franchisee base over the past several years the company experienced traffic increases in both our domestic companyowned and franchise stores in 2010 and 2011 domestic same store sales in fiscal 2009 reflected the success of several initiatives including the launch of two new product platforms domino’s breadbowl pasta™ and domino’s american legends ® pizzas as well as the introduction of domino’s chocolate lava crunch cakes and the introduction of our improved pizza recipe during the fourth quarter of 2009 international same store sales increased 43 in 2009 69 in 2010 and 68 in 2011 internationally same stores sales growth continues to result from the growing acceptance of pizza and delivered pizza around the globe and the successful execution of the domino’s pizza concept 

income from operations increased 314 million or 138 in 2011 and increased 382 million or 202 in 2010 the increase in 2011 was driven primarily by higher royalty revenues from both domestic and international franchise stores and to a lesser extent the positive impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates additionally income from operations in 2011 benefited from higher domestic companyowned store margins the increase in income from operations in 2010 was due primarily to higher royalty revenues from domestic and international franchise stores and larger volumes in our supply chain business additionally income from operations in 2010 benefited from higher domestic companyowned store margins and approximately 49 million of expenses incurred in 2009 in connection with the company’s equity incentive plan changes that did not recur in 2010 these increases were offset in part by higher variable general and administrative expenses including higher performancebased bonuses as a result of our strong operating performance as well as continued investments in growth initiatives additionally the comparable results for 2010 were negatively impacted by the inclusion of the 53 rd week in 2009 which benefited income from operations by approximately 67 million in 2009 

  

net income increased 175 million or 198 in 2011 and increased 82 million or 102 in 2010 the increase in 2011 was due primarily to the aforementioned increase in income from operations and lower interest expense the increase was offset in part by gains recorded on the extinguishment of debt in 2010 the increase in net income in 2010 was due primarily to the aforementioned increase in income from operations lower interest expense resulting from lower debt balances and the positive impact of a lower effective tax rate offset in part by lower pretax gains recorded on the extinguishment of debt and the negative impact of the 53rd week in 2009 the inclusion of the 53 rd week benefited net income in 2009 by approximately 29 million 

we are highly leveraged primarily as a result of our recapitalization in 2007 as of january 1 2012 consolidated debt was 145 billion historically a large portion of our cash flows from operations has been used to make principal and interest payments on our indebtedness as well as distributions to shareholders in the form of dividends and stock repurchases our securitized debt requires interestonly payments until april 2012 this interestonly period can be extended for two oneyear periods if the company meets certain requirements in april 2012 and april 2013 based on fiscal 2011 financial results the company currently exceeds the required threshold for extension that will be evaluated in each of april 2012 and april 2013 management currently expects to have the option to take advantage of these interestonly periods at the extension assessment dates and would plan to exercise those extensions if a refinancing was not completed prior to the extension dates during the third quarter of 2011 the company announced its intention to refinance its existing securitized debt in connection with the proposed early refinancing the company incurred approximately 76 million of fees during 2011 of which approximately 74 million were recorded as a deferred financing cost asset in the consolidated balance sheets due to volatility in the financial markets the company later announced its intention to postpone the refinancing upon the completion of the expected refinancing the deferred financing fees incurred plus any incremental fees will be amortized over the expected term of the new securitized debt overall we believe that our ability to consistently produce significant excess cash flows allows us the flexibility not only to service our debt but also to invest in our growing business as well as return cash to our shareholders 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america the preparation of these financial statements requires our management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis our management evaluates its estimates including those related to revenue recognition allowance for uncollectible receivables longlived and intangible assets insurance and legal matters sharebased payments and income taxes we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from those estimates changes in our accounting policies and estimates could materially impact our results of operations and financial condition for any particular period we believe that our most critical accounting policies and estimates are 

revenue recognition  we earn revenues through our network of domestic companyowned and franchise stores dough manufacturing and supply chain centers and international operations retail sales from companyowned stores and royalty revenues resulting from the retail sales from franchise stores are recognized as revenues when the items are delivered to or carried out by customers retail sales are generally reported and related royalties paid to the company on a weekly basis based on a percentage of retail sales as specified in the related standard franchise agreement generally 55 of domestic franchise retail sales in the event that retail sales are not reported timely by a franchisee the company will record royalty revenues in the period earned based on an estimate of the franchisee’s sales however these estimates are not significant and have historically been materially consistent with the actual amounts revenues from companyowned stores and royalty revenues from franchise stores fluctuate from timetotime as a result of store count changes for example if a companyowned store that generated 500000 in revenue in fiscal 2010 is sold to a franchisee in fiscal 2011 revenues from companyowned stores would have declined by 500000 in fiscal 2011 while franchise royalty revenues would have increased by only 27500 in fiscal 2011 as we generally collect 55 of a domestic franchisee’s retail sales sales of food from our supply chain centers are recognized as revenues upon delivery of the food to franchisees while sales of equipment and supplies are generally recognized as revenues upon shipment of the related products to franchisees 

  

allowance for uncollectible receivables we closely monitor our accounts and notes receivable balances and provide allowances for uncollectible amounts as a result of our reviews these estimates are based on among other factors historical collection experience and a review of our receivables by aging category additionally we may also provide allowances for uncollectible receivables based on specific customer collection issues that we have identified while writeoffs of bad debts have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established management cannot guarantee that future writeoffs will not exceed historical rates specifically if the financial condition of our franchisees were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments additional allowances may be required 

at january 1 2012 our total allowance for uncollectible accounts receivables was approximately 54 million compared to 64 million at january 2 2011 representing approximately 59 and 74 of our consolidated gross accounts receivable at those respective yearends a 10 change in our allowance for uncollectible accounts receivables at january 1 2012 would result in a change in reserves of approximately 05 million and a change in income before provision for income taxes by the same amount currently management does not believe that there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions that were used to calculate our allowance for uncollectible accounts receivables 

longlived and intangible assets we record longlived assets including property plant and equipment and capitalized software at cost for acquisitions of franchise operations we estimate the fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired based on physical inspection of assets historical experience and other information available to us regarding the acquisition we depreciate and amortize longlived assets using useful lives determined by us based on historical experience and other information available to us we evaluate the potential impairment of longlived assets at least annually based on various analyses including the projection of undiscounted cash flows and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable for companyowned stores we perform related impairment tests on an operating market basis which the company has determined to be the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of other cash flows if the carrying amount of a longlived asset exceeds the amount of the expected future undiscounted cash flows of that asset or the estimated fair value of the asset an impairment loss is recognized and the asset is written down to its estimated fair value 

we have not made any significant changes in the methodology used to project the future market cash flows of companyowned stores during the years presented same store sales fluctuations and the rates at which operating costs will fluctuate in the future are key factors in evaluating recoverability of the related assets if our same store sales significantly decline or if operating costs increase and we are unable to recover these costs the carrying value of our companyowned stores by market may be unrecoverable and we may be required to recognize an impairment charge at january 1 2012 we determined that our longlived assets were not impaired 

a significant portion of our goodwill relates to acquisitions of domestic franchise stores and is included in our domestic stores segment specifically the companyowned stores reporting unit we evaluate goodwill annually for impairment by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit which is primarily determined using the present value of historical cash flows to its carrying value if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value goodwill would be impaired we have not made any significant changes in the methodology used to evaluate goodwill impairment during the years presented at january 1 2012 the fair value of our business operations with associated goodwill exceeded their recorded carrying value including the related goodwill if cash flows generated by our companyowned stores were to decline significantly in the future or there were negative revisions to the market multiple assumption we may be required to recognize a goodwill impairment charge however based on the latest impairment analysis we do not believe it is reasonably likely that there could be changes in assumptions that would trigger impairment 

insurance and legal matters we are a party to lawsuits and legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business management closely monitors these legal matters and estimates the probable costs for the resolution of such matters these estimates are primarily determined by consulting with both internal and external parties handling the matters and are based upon an analysis of potential results assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies while historically our actual losses have been materially consistent with our reserves legal judgments can be volatile and difficult to predict accordingly if our estimates relating to legal matters proved inaccurate for any reason we may be required to increase or decrease the related expense in future periods we had accruals for legal matters of approximately 66 million at january 2 2011 and approximately 101 million at january 1 2012 

  

for certain periods prior to december 1998 and for periods after december 2001 we maintain insurance coverage for workers’ compensation general liability and owned and nonowned auto liability under insurance policies requiring payment of a deductible for each occurrence up to between 500000 and 30 million depending on the policy year and line of coverage the related insurance reserves are based on undiscounted independent actuarial estimates which are based on historical information along with assumptions about future events specifically various methods including analyses of historical trends and actuarial valuation methods are utilized to estimate the cost to settle reported claims and claims incurred but not yet reported the actuarial valuation methods develop estimates of the future ultimate claim costs based on the claims incurred as of the balance sheet date when estimating these liabilities several factors are considered including the severity duration and frequency of claims legal cost associated with claims healthcare trends and projected inflation over the past several years we have experienced improvements in frequency of claims however increasing severity of claims and medical costs has partially offset these trends 

our methodology for determining our exposure has remained consistent throughout the years presented management believes that the various assumptions developed and actuarial methods used to determine our selfinsurance reserves are reasonable and provide meaningful data that management uses to make its best estimate of our exposure to these risks while historically our actual losses have been materially consistent with our reserves changes in assumptions for such factors as medical costs and legal actions as well as changes in actual experience could cause our estimates to change in the near term which could result in an increase or decrease in the related expense in future periods a 10 change in our selfinsurance liability at january 1 2012 would have affected our income before provision for income taxes by approximately 34 million for fiscal 2011 we had accruals for insurance matters of approximately 312 million at january 2 2011 and 344 million at january 1 2012 

sharebased payments we recognize compensation expense related to our sharebased compensation arrangements over the requisite service period based on the grant date fair value of the awards the grant date fair value of each restricted stock and performancebased restricted stock award is equal to the market price of our stock on the date of grant the grant date fair value of each stock option award is estimated using a blackscholes option pricing model the pricing model requires assumptions including the expected life of the stock option the riskfree interest rate and expected volatility of our stock over the expected life which significantly impact the assumed fair value we are also required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and only recognize expense for those awards expected to vest we use historical data to determine these assumptions additionally our stock option restricted stock and performancebased restricted stock arrangements provide for accelerated vesting and the ability to exercise during the remainder of the tenyear stock option life upon the retirement of individuals holding the awards who have achieved specified service and age requirements management believes that the methods and various assumptions used to determine compensation expense related to these arrangements are reasonable but if the assumptions change significantly for future grants sharebased compensation expense will fluctuate in future years 

income taxes we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities and reserves for uncertain tax positions we measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using current enacted tax rates that will apply in the years in which we expect the temporary differences to be recovered or paid judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes and related reserves deferred tax assets and liabilities these include establishing a valuation allowance related to the ability to realize certain deferred tax assets if necessary as of january 1 2012 we had no valuation allowances recorded for deferred tax assets our accounting for deferred tax assets represents our best estimate of future events our net deferred tax assets assume that we will generate sufficient taxable income in specific tax jurisdictions based on our estimates and assumptions changes in our current estimates due to unanticipated events could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operation 

the amounts relating to taxes recorded on the balance sheet including tax reserves also consider the ultimate resolution of revenue agent reviews based on estimates and assumptions we believe we have adequately accounted for our uncertain tax positions however tax audits changes in tax laws and other unforeseen matters may result in us owing additional taxes we adjust our reserves for uncertain tax positions when facts and circumstances change or due to the passage of time for example the completion of a tax audit or the expiration of a statute of limitations or changes in penalty and interest reserves associated with uncertain tax positions management believes that our tax positions comply with applicable tax law and that we have adequately provided for these matters however to the extent the final tax outcome of these matters is different than our recorded amounts we may be required to adjust our tax reserves resulting in additional income tax expense or benefit in future periods

liquidity and capital resources 

as of january 1 2012 we had working capital of 371 million excluding restricted cash and cash equivalents of 926 million and including total unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of 503 million historically we have operated with minimal positive working capital or negative working capital primarily because our receivable collection periods and inventory turn rates are faster than the normal payment terms on our current liabilities we generally collect our receivables within three weeks from the date of the related sale and we generally experience 30 to 40 inventory turns per year in addition our sales are not typically seasonal which further limits our working capital requirements these factors coupled with the use of our ongoing cash flows from operations to service our debt obligations invest in our business and repurchase our fixed rate notes and our common stock reduce our working capital amounts as of january 1 2012 the company had approximately 413 million of cash held in trust or as collateral for outstanding letters of credit primarily relating to our insurance programs and supply chain center leases 384 million of cash held for future interest payments 66 million of cash held in interest reserves 60 million of cash held for capitalization of certain subsidiaries and 03 million of other restricted cash for a total of 926 million of restricted cash and cash equivalents 

as of january 1 2012 we had approximately 145 billion of total debt of which 09 million was classified as a current liability our primary source of liquidity is cash flows from operations during fiscal 2010 the company borrowed an additional 24 million under its variable funding note facility and is now fully drawn on the 600 million facility our securitized debt requires interestonly payments until april 2012 this interestonly period can be extended for two oneyear periods if the company meets certain requirements in each of april 2012 and april 2013 based on our financial results for fiscal 2011 the company currently exceeds the required threshold for extension that would be evaluated in each of april 2012 and april 2013 management currently expects to have the option to take advantage of these interestonly periods at the extension assessment dates and would plan to exercise those extensions if a refinancing was not completed prior to the extension dates 

  

during the third quarter of 2011 the company announced its intention to refinance its existing securitized debt in connection with the proposed early refinancing the company incurred approximately 76 million of fees during fiscal 2011 of which approximately 74 million were recorded as a deferred financing cost asset in the consolidated balance sheet due to volatility in the financial markets the company later announced its intention to postpone the refinancing upon the completion of the expected refinancing the deferred financing fees incurred plus any incremental fees will be amortized over the expected term of the new securitized debt should the company determine that it is no longer likely that the refinancing will be completed as originally structured some or all of these fees may be required to be expensed at that time 

during 2011 the company made no repurchases of its outstanding fixed rate notes during 2010 the company used a combination of cash on hand and cash flows from operations to fund the repurchase and retirement of 1000 million in principal amount of its senior fixed rate notes and approximately 239 million of its subordinated fixed rate notes for a combined purchase price of approximately 1166 million including 05 million of accrued interest including the repurchases made in fiscal 2009 and 2010 the company has repurchased and retired a total of 3131 million of principal of its outstanding fixed rate notes for a total purchase price of approximately 2506 million including 15 million of accrued interest 

the company has a board of directors approved open market share repurchase program of the company’s common stock which was reset during the third quarter of 2011 at 2000 million the open market share repurchase program has historically been funded by excess cash flows and borrowings available under the variable funding notes the company used cash of approximately 54 million and 1650 million in 2010 and 2011 respectively for share repurchases under this program the company has approximately 823 million left under the 2000 million authorization as of january 1 2012 the company did not repurchase any of its common shares in 2009 as it focused on reducing outstanding fixed rate notes the company expects to continue to use available unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and ongoing excess cash flow generation to among other things repurchase shares under the current authorized program 

during 2011 the company experienced an increase in both domestic and international same store sales versus 2010 the same store sales were strong given that we were rolling over significant same store sales growth in 2010 these results demonstrate the sustained improvement in our domestic business and the consistent and reliable growth of our international business segment additionally our international business continued to grow store count at a record pace in 2011 all of these factors have contributed to the company’s continued ability to generate positive operating cash flows we expect to use our unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and ongoing cash flows from operations to fund working capital requirements invest in our core business reduce our longterm debt and repurchase our common stock we have historically funded our working capital requirements capital expenditures debt repayments and repurchases of common stock primarily from our cash flows from operations and on occasion our available borrowings under the variable funding notes management believes its current unrestricted cash and cash equivalents balance and its expected ongoing cash flows from operations will be sufficient to fund operations for the foreseeable future 

we expect capital expenditures of approximately 250 million to 350 million in fiscal 2012 these capital expenditures primarily relate to investments in existing companyowned stores and supply chain centers as well as investments in our proprietary internally developed pointofsale system domino’s pulse™ our digital ordering platform and other technology initiatives all of which we feel are necessary to sustain and grow our business we did not have any material commitments for capital expenditures as of january 1 2012 

cash provided by operating activities was 1531 million in 2011 1283 million in 2010 and 1013 million in 2009 the 248 million increase in 2011 versus 2010 was due primarily to a 134 million net change in operating assets and liabilities due primarily to the timing of payments on current operating liabilities and an 114 million increase in net income excluding noncash adjustments the 270 million increase in 2010 versus 2009 was due primarily to a 329 million increase in net income excluding noncash adjustments this was offset in part by a 59 million net change in operating assets and liabilities due primarily to the timing of payments on current operating liabilities we are focused on continually improving our net income and cash flow from operations as noted above we generated 1531 million of cash from our operating activities even after deducting our 243 million of capital expenditures we generated a substantial amount of excess cash in 2011 some of which was deployed on other activities including repurchases of our common stock or similar uses of cash management expects to continue to generate positive cash flows from operating activities for the foreseeable future 

  

cash used in investing activities was 269 million in 2011 184 million in 2010 and 329 million in 2009 the 85 million increase in 2011 versus 2010 was due primarily to a 127 million change in restricted cash and cash equivalents offset in part by a 33 million increase in proceeds from the sale of assets resulting from the sale of certain companyowned operations in 2011 and a 11 million decrease in capital expenditures the 145 million decrease in 2010 versus 2009 was due primarily to a 179 million change in restricted cash and cash equivalents offset in part by a 26 million increase in capital expenditures 

cash used in financing activities was 1235 million in 2011 1043 million in 2010 and 708 million in 2009 the 192 million increase in 2011 versus 2010 was due primarily to a 1596 million increase in purchases of common stock 38 million cash paid for financing costs in 2011 and a 24 million increase in tax payments for restricted stock these increases were offset in part by a 1159 million decrease in repayments of longterm debt and capital lease obligations a 241 million increase in the proceeds from exercise of stock options and a 135 million increase in the tax impact of our equitybased compensation the 335 million increase in 2010 versus 2009 was due primarily to a 581 million decrease in proceeds from issuance of longterm debt offset in part by a 199 million decrease in repayments of longterm debt and capital lease obligations 

based upon the current level of operations and anticipated growth we believe that the cash generated from operations and our current unrestricted cash and cash equivalents will be adequate to meet our anticipated debt service requirements capital expenditures and working capital needs for the foreseeable future our ability to continue to fund these items and continue to reduce debt could be adversely affected by the occurrence of any of the events described in item 1a risk factors there can be no assurance however that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operations or that future borrowings will be available under the variable funding notes or otherwise to enable us to service our indebtedness or to make anticipated capital expenditures our future operating performance and our ability to service extend or refinance the fixed rate notes and to service extend or refinance the variable funding notes will be subject to future economic conditions and to financial business and other factors many of which are beyond our control 

impact of inflation 

we believe that our results of operations are not materially impacted by moderate changes in the inflation rate inflation did not have a material impact on our operations in 2009 2010 or 2011 severe increases in inflation however could affect the global and us economies and could have an adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations further discussion on the impact of commodities and other cost pressures is included above as well as in item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

new accounting pronouncements

in september 2011 the fasb amended the guidance on the annual testing of goodwill for impairment the amended guidance will allow companies to assess qualitative factors to determine if it is morelikelythannot that goodwill might be impaired and whether it is necessary to perform the twostep goodwill impairment test required under current accounting standards this guidance will be effective for the company’s fiscal year ending december 30 2012 with early adoption permitted the company has determined that this new guidance will not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements 

other accounting standards that have been issued by the fasb or other standardssetting bodies that do not require adoption until a future date are not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements upon adoption

we are party to letters of credit and to a lesser extent financial guarantees with offbalance sheet risk our exposure to credit loss for letters of credit and financial guarantees is represented by the contractual amounts of these instruments total conditional commitments under letters of credit as of january 1 2012 were approximately 397 million and relate to our insurance programs and supply chain center leases the company has restricted 413 million of cash on its consolidated balance sheet as collateral for these letters of credit the company has also guaranteed borrowings of franchisees of approximately 05 million as of january 1 2012 additionally the company has guaranteed lease payments related to certain franchisees’ lease arrangements the maximum amount of potential future payments under these guarantees is 32 million as of january 1 2012 we believe that none of these arrangements has or is likely to have a material effect on our results of operations financial condition or liquidity

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk 

we do not engage in speculative transactions nor do we hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes in connection with the recapitalization in 2007 we issued fixed rate notes and at january 1 2012 we are only exposed to interest rate risk on borrowings under our variable funding notes as of january 1 2012 we had 600 million outstanding under our variable funding note facility our fixed rate debt exposes the company to changes in market interest rates reflected in the fair value of the debt and to the risk that the company may need to refinance maturing debt with new debt at a higher rate 

we are exposed to market risks from changes in commodity prices during the normal course of business we purchase cheese and certain other food products that are affected by changes in commodity prices and as a result we are subject to volatility in our food costs we may periodically enter into financial instruments to manage this risk we do not engage in speculative transactions nor do we hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes in instances when we use forward pricing agreements with our suppliers these agreements cover our physical commodity needs are not netsettled and are accounted for as normal purchases 

interest rate derivatives 

from time to time we have entered into interest rate swaps collars or similar instruments with the objective of managing volatility relating to our borrowing costs we had no outstanding derivative instruments as of january 1 2012 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

we have exposure to various foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations for revenues generated by our operations outside the united states which can adversely impact our net income and cash flows total revenues of approximately 105 in 2009 112 in 2010 and 122 in 2011 were derived from sales to customers and royalties from franchisees outside the contiguous united states this business is conducted in the local currency but royalty payments are generally remitted to us in us dollars we do not enter into financial instruments to manage this foreign currency exchange risk a hypothetical 10 adverse change in the foreign currency rates in each of our top ten international markets based on store count would have resulted in a negative impact on revenues of approximately 80 million in 2011

we celebrated our 50 th anniversary in 2010 and over our 50year history we have developed a simple business model focused on our core strength of delivering quality pizza and other complementary items in a timely manner this business model includes a deliveryoriented store design with low capital requirements a focused menu of pizza and other complementary items committed owneroperator franchisees and a verticallyintegrated supply chain system our earnings are driven largely by retail sales at our franchise stores which generate royalty payments and supply chain revenues to us we also generate earnings through retail sales at our companyowned stores internationally similar dynamics apply however certain geographies are granted to a qualified master franchisee and this master franchisee can utilize three potential income streams running corporate stores subfranchising and running supply chain centers 

we operate our business in three segments domestic stores domestic supply chain and international 

• domestic stores the domestic stores segment which is comprised of 4475 franchise stores and 454 companyowned stores generated revenues of 5190 million and income from operations of 1413 million during our fiscal year ended january 2 2011 which we refer to herein as 2010

on a consolidated basis we generated revenues of more than 15 billion and income from operations after deducting 623 million of unallocated corporate and other expenses of 2277 million in 2010 net income was 879 million in 2010 in each of the past three years we have been able to increase our net income grow our global retail sales and in those three years have added more than 700 net stores worldwide we are able to grow our business with capital expenditures that generally range between 200 million to 300 million on an annualized basis as a significant portion of our earnings are derived from retail sales by our franchisees 

our history 

we have been delivering quality affordable pizza to our customers since 1960 when brothers thomas and james monaghan borrowed 900 and purchased a small pizza store in ypsilanti michigan since that time our store count and geographic reach have grown substantially we opened our first franchise store in 1967 and our first international store in 1983 during 2010 we opened our 9000 th store worldwide and as of january 2 2011 we had 9351 stores worldwide in the us and more than 65 international markets we celebrated the company’s 50 th anniversary on december 9 2010 

  

in 1998 an investor group led by investment funds associated with bain capital llc completed a recapitalization through which the investor group acquired a 93 controlling economic interest in our company from thomas monaghan and his family in 2004 domino’s pizza inc completed its initial public offering the “ipo” and now trades on the new york stock exchange under the ticker symbol “dpz” during 2010 bain capital llc divested substantially all of their holdings in the company 

during 2007 the company completed a recapitalization transaction the “2007 recapitalization” consisting of among other things i the issuance of 17 billion of borrowings of fixed rate notes ii the purchase and retirement of all outstanding senior subordinated notes iii the repayment of all outstanding borrowings under its senior credit facility and iv the payment of a special cash dividend to shareholders and related antidilution payments and adjustments to certain stock option holders 

in january 2010 david a brandon announced his plan to resign from his position as chief executive officer effective march 7 2010 concurrently it was announced that j patrick doyle would succeed mr brandon as president and chief executive officer and in february 2010 mr doyle was appointed to the board of directors mr brandon was retained by the company as a special advisor for the balance of 2010 and remains chairman of the company’s board of directors 

industry overview 

in this document we rely on and refer to information regarding the us quick service restaurant or qsr sector the us qsr pizza category and its components and competitors including us from the crest ® report prepared by the npd group as well as market research reports analyst reports and other publiclyavailable information although we believe this information to be reliable we have not independently verified it domestic sales information relating to the qsr sector us qsr pizza category and us pizza delivery and carryout represent reported consumer spending obtained by the npd group’s crest ® report from consumer surveys this information relates to both our companyowned and franchise stores unless otherwise indicated all us industry data included in this document is based on reported consumer spending obtained by the npd group’s crest ® report from consumer surveys 

the us qsr pizza category is large and fragmented with sales of 341 billion in the twelve months ended november 2010 it is the second largest category within the 2329 billion us qsr sector the us qsr pizza category is primarily comprised of delivery dinein and carryout 

we operate primarily within the us pizza delivery component its 105 billion of sales accounted for approximately 31 of total us qsr pizza category sales in the twelve months ended november 2010 we and our top two competitors account for approximately 46 of us pizza delivery based on reported consumer spending with the remaining 54 attributable to regional chains and individual establishments 

we also compete in the growing carryout component which together with pizza delivery comprise the largest components of the us qsr pizza category us carryout pizza had 145 billion of sales in the twelve months ended november 2010 and while our primary focus is on pizza delivery we are also favorably positioned to compete in carryout given our strong brand convenient store locations and quality affordable menu offerings 

in contrast to the united states international pizza delivery is relatively underdeveloped with only domino’s and one other competitor having a significant global presence we believe that demand for international pizza and pizza delivery is large and growing driven by international consumers’ increasing emphasis on convenience and the proven success of our 27 years of conducting business abroad 

our competitive strengths 

we believe that our competitive strengths include the following 

• strong and proven growth and earnings model over our 50year history we have developed a focused growth and earnings model this model is anchored by strong storelevel economics which provide an entrepreneurial incentive for our franchisees and generate demand for new stores our franchise system in turn has produced strong and consistent earnings for us through royalty payments and supply chain revenues with minimal associated capital expenditures by us

in addition we generally share 50 of the pretax profits generated by our regional dough manufacturing and supply chain centers with those domestic franchisees who agree to purchase all of their food from our supply chain system during 2010 we issued a record level of profit sharing payments to our franchisees in connection with this program these arrangements strengthen our ties with our franchisees by enhancing their profitability while providing us with a continuing source of revenues and earnings this arrangement also provides incentives for franchisees to work closely with us to reduce costs we believe our strong mutuallybeneficial franchisee relationships are evidenced by the over 99 voluntary participation in our domestic supply chain system our over 99 domestic franchise contract renewal rate and our over 99 collection rate on domestic franchise royalty and domestic supply chain receivables 

internationally we have been able to grow our franchise network by attracting franchisees with business experience and local market knowledge we generally employ our master franchise model which provides our international franchisees with exclusive rights to operate stores and subfranchise our wellrecognized domino’s pizza ® brand name in specific agreedupon market areas as well as operate their own supply chain systems from yearend 2005 through 2010 we grew our international franchise network 48 from 2987 stores to 4422 stores our largest master franchisee operates 815 stores in five markets which accounts for approximately 18 of our total international store count during 2010 we had 350 net international store openings including stores in bulgaria germany romania ukraine and vietnam which were new market openings for domino’s pizza

because we source the food for substantially all of our domestic stores our domestic supply chain segment enables us to leverage and monitor our strong supplier relationships to achieve the cost benefits of scale and to ensure compliance with our rigorous quality standards in addition the “onestop shop” nature of this system combined with our delivery accuracy allows our store managers to eliminate a significant component of the typical “backofstore” activity that many of our competitors’ store managers must undertake additionally we operate six supply chain centers that service certain of our international franchise markets

store operations 

we believe that our focused and proven store model provides a significant competitive advantage relative to many of our competitors who focus on multiple components of the pizza category particularly dinein we have been focused primarily on pizza delivery for 50 years because our domestic stores and most of our international stores do not offer extensive dinein areas they typically do not require expensive real estate are relatively small and are relatively inexpensive to build and equip our stores also benefit from lower maintenance costs as store assets have long lives and updates are not frequently required our simple and efficient operational processes which we have refined through continuous improvement include 

• strategic store locations to facilitate delivery service 

• productionoriented store designs 

• product and process innovations 

• a focused menu 

• efficient order taking production and delivery 

• domino’s pulse™ pointofsale system and 

• a comprehensive store operations evaluation program 

strategic store locations to facilitate delivery service 

we locate our stores strategically to facilitate timely delivery service to our customers the majority of our domestic stores are located in populated areas in or adjacent to large or midsize cities or on or near college campuses we use geographic information software which incorporates variables such as traffic volumes competitor locations household demographics and visibility to evaluate and identify potential store locations and new markets 

productionoriented store designs 

our typical store is relatively small occupying approximately 1000 to 1300 square feet and is designed with a focus on efficient and timely production of consistently high quality pizza for delivery the store layout has been refined over time to provide an efficient flow from ordertaking to delivery our stores are primarily production facilities and accordingly do not typically have an extensive dinein area 

product and process innovations 

our 50 years of experience and innovative culture have resulted in numerous new product and process developments that increase both quality and efficiency these include our efficient verticallyintegrated supply chain system a sturdier corrugated pizza box and a mesh screen that helped cook pizza crust more evenly the domino’s heatwave ® hot bag keeps our pizzas hot during delivery we also continue to introduce new products such as domino’s oven baked sandwiches launched in 2008 along with additional products launched in 2009 including domino’s american legends ® pizzas and domino’s breadbowl pasta™ additionally we have added a number of complementary side items to our menu such as boneless chicken and wings bread sticks cheesy bread cinna stix ® and chocolate lava crunch cakes which were introduced in 2009 in the fourth quarter of 2009 we introduced our improved pizza recipe which was a change to our core pizza recipe

domino’s pulse™ pointofsale system 

our computerized management information systems are designed to improve operating efficiencies provide corporate management with timely access to financial and marketing data and reduce store and corporate administrative time and expense we have installed domino’s pulse™ our proprietary pointofsale system in every companyowned store in the united states and in substantially all of our domestic franchise stores domino’s pulse™ features include

• a delivery driver routing system which ensures delivery efficiency

we require our domestic franchisees to install and maintain domino’s pulse™ additionally domino’s pulse™ has been installed in nearly 1600 international franchise stores 

comprehensive store operations evaluation program 

we utilize a comprehensive evaluation program to ensure that our stores are meeting both our stringent standards as well as the expectations of our customers the program focuses primarily on the quality of the pizza the store is producing the customer service the store is providing and the condition of the store as viewed by the customer we believe that this program is an integral part of our strategy to maintain high standards in our stores 

segment overview 

we operate in three business segments 

• domestic stores our domestic stores segment consists of our domestic franchise operations which oversees a network of 4475 franchise stores located in the contiguous united states and our domestic companyowned store operations which operates a network of 454 companyowned stores located in the contiguous united states 

• domestic supply chain our domestic supply chain segment operates 16 regional dough manufacturing and food supply chain centers one thin crust manufacturing center one supply chain center providing equipment and supplies to certain of our domestic and international stores and one vegetable processing supply chain center and 

• international our international segment oversees our network of 4422 international franchise stores in more than 65 international markets our international segment also distributes food to a limited number of markets from six dough manufacturing and supply chain centers in canada four alaska and hawaii 

  

domestic stores 

during 2010 our domestic stores segment accounted for 5190 million or 33 of our consolidated revenues our domestic franchises are operated by entrepreneurs who own and operate an average of four stores seven of our domestic franchisees operate more than 50 stores including our largest domestic franchisee who operates 144 stores our principal sources of revenues from domestic store operations are companyowned store sales and royalty payments based on retail sales by our franchisees our domestic network of companyowned stores also plays an important strategic role in our predominantly franchised operating structure in addition to generating revenues and earnings we use our domestic companyowned stores as test sites for new products and promotions as well as store operational improvements and as forums for training new store managers and prospective franchisees we also believe that our domestic companyowned stores add to the economies of scale available for advertising marketing and other costs that are primarily borne by our franchisees while we continue to be primarily a franchised business we continually evaluate our mix of domestic companyowned and franchise stores in an effort to optimize our longterm profitability 

our domestic companyowned store operations are divided into eleven geographic areas located throughout the contiguous united states while our domestic franchise operations are divided into four regions our team members within these areas provide direct supervision over our domestic companyowned stores provide training store operational audits and marketing services and provide financial analysis and store development services to our franchisees we maintain a close relationship with our franchise stores through regional franchise teams an array of computerbased training materials that help franchise stores comply with our standards and franchise advisory groups that facilitate communications between us and our franchisees 

domestic supply chain 

during 2010 our domestic supply chain segment accounted for 8755 million or 56 of our consolidated revenues our domestic supply chain segment is comprised primarily of 16 regional dough manufacturing and supply chain centers that manufacture fresh dough on a daily basis and purchase receive store and deliver quality pizzarelated food products and other complementary items to all of our companyowned stores and over 99 of our domestic franchise stores each regional dough manufacturing and supply chain center serves approximately 300 stores generally located within a oneday delivery radius we regularly supply nearly 5000 stores with various supplies and ingredients of which nine product groups account for over 90 of the volume our domestic supply chain segment made approximately 515000 fullservice deliveries in 2010 or approximately two deliveries per store per week and we produced over 310 million pounds of dough during 2010 

we believe that our franchisees voluntarily choose to obtain food supplies and equipment from us because we provide the most efficient convenient and costeffective alternative while also providing both quality and consistency in addition our domestic supply chain segment offers a profitsharing arrangement to stores that purchase all of their food from our domestic dough manufacturing and supply chain centers this profitsharing arrangement generally provides domestic companyowned stores and participating franchisees with 50 of their regional supply chain center’s pretax profits profits are shared with the franchisees based upon each franchisee’s purchases from our supply chain centers during 2010 we issued a record level of profit sharing payments to our franchisees in connection with this program we believe these arrangements strengthen our ties with these franchisees 

the information systems used by our domestic dough manufacturing and supply chain centers are an integral part of the quality service we provide our stores we use routing strategies and software to optimize our daily delivery schedules which maximizes ontime deliveries through our strategic dough manufacturing and supply chain center locations and proven routing systems we achieved an ontime delivery performance rate of nearly 95 during 2010 our supply chain center drivers unload food and supplies and stock store shelves typically during nonpeak store hours which minimize disruptions in store operations 

international 

during 2010 our international segment accounted for 1764 million or 11 of our consolidated revenues at january 2 2011 we had 4422 international franchise stores including 616 stores in the united kingdom 590 stores in mexico 426 stores in australia 364 stores in india 345 stores in south korea 341 stores in canada and over 100 stores in each of japan france turkey taiwan and the netherlands the principal sources of revenues from our international operations are royalty payments generated by retail sales from franchise stores and sales of food and supplies to franchisees in certain markets 

  

we have grown by more than 1400 international stores over the past five years during 2010 we had 350 net international store openings including stores in bulgaria germany romania ukraine and vietnam which were new market openings for domino’s pizza our international franchisees adapt our standard operating model within certain parameters to satisfy the local eating habits and consumer preferences of various regions outside the united states currently most of our international stores are operated under master franchise agreements and we plan to continue entering into master franchise agreements with qualified franchisees to expand our international operations in selected countries we believe that our international franchise stores appeal to potential franchisees because of our wellrecognized brand name the limited capital expenditures required to open and operate our stores and our system’s favorable store economics the following table shows our store count as of january 2 2011 in our top ten international markets which account for 76 of our international stores 

 

 our domestic franchise program 

as of january 2 2011 our 4475 domestic franchise stores were owned and operated by our 1117 domestic franchisees the success of our franchise formula which enables franchisees to benefit from our brand name with a relatively low initial capital investment has attracted a large number of motivated entrepreneurs as franchisees as of january 2 2011 the average domestic franchisee owned and operated four stores and had been in our franchise system for over thirteen years at the same time seven of our domestic franchisees operated more than 50 stores including our largest domestic franchisee who operates 144 stores 

franchisees 

we apply rigorous standards to prospective franchisees we generally require prospective domestic franchisees to manage a store for at least one year before being granted a franchise this enables us to observe the operational and financial performance of a potential franchisee prior to entering into a longterm contract we also generally restrict the ability of domestic franchisees to be involved in other businesses which focuses our franchisees’ attention on operating their stores as a result the vast majority of our domestic franchisees have historically come from within the domino’s pizza system we believe these standards are largely unique to the franchise industry and result in qualified and focused franchisees operating their stores 

franchise agreements 

we enter into franchise agreements with domestic franchisees under which the franchisee is granted the right to operate a store in a particular location for a term of ten years with options to renew for an additional term of ten years we currently have a franchise contract renewal rate of over 99 under the current standard franchise agreement we assign an exclusive area of primary responsibility to each franchise store during the term of the franchise agreement the franchisee is required to pay a 55 royalty fee on sales subject in limited instances to lower rates based on area development agreements sales initiatives and new store incentives we have the contractual right subject to state law to terminate a franchise agreement for a variety of reasons including but not limited to a franchisee’s failure to make required payments when due or failure to adhere to specified company policies and standards 

franchise store development 

we provide domestic franchisees with assistance in selecting store sites and conforming the space to the physical specifications required for a domino’s pizza store each domestic franchisee selects the location and design for each store subject to our approval based on accessibility and visibility of the site and demographic factors including population density and anticipated traffic levels we also sell fixtures and equipment to most of our franchise stores 

  

our international franchise program 

franchisees 

the vast majority of our markets outside of the contiguous united states are operated by master franchisees with franchise and distribution rights for entire regions or countries in a few select regions or countries we franchise directly to individual store operators prospective master franchisees are required to possess or have access to local market knowledge required to establish and develop domino’s pizza stores the local market knowledge focuses on the ability to identify and access targeted real estate sites along with expertise in local customs culture consumer behavior and laws we also seek candidates that have access to sufficient capital to meet their growth and development plans 

master franchise agreements 

our master franchise agreements generally grant the franchisee exclusive rights to develop or subfranchise stores and the right to operate supply chain centers in a particular geographic area for a term of 10 to 20 years with options to renew for additional terms the agreements typically contain growth clauses requiring franchisees to open a minimum number of stores within a specified period the master franchisee is generally required to pay an initial onetime franchise fee as well as an additional franchise fee upon the opening of each new store in addition the master franchisee is required to pay a continuing royalty fee as a percentage of retail sales which varies among international markets and averaged approximately 30 in 2010 

franchise training and support 

training store managers and employees is a critical component of our success we require all domestic franchisees to complete initial and ongoing training programs provided by us in addition under the standard domestic franchise agreement domestic franchisees are required to implement training programs for their store employees we assist our domestic and international franchisees by making training materials available to them for their use in training store managers and employees including computerbased training materials comprehensive operations manuals and franchise development classes during 2009 significantly all of our domestic franchisees attended our “highperformance franchisee training” a comprehensive program to train and recertify our franchisees we also maintain communications with our franchisees online through various newsletters electronic communications and through facetoface meetings 

franchise operations 

we enforce stringent standards over franchise operations to protect the domino’s pizza ® brand all franchisees are required to operate their stores in compliance with written policies standards and specifications which include matters such as menu items ingredients materials supplies services furnishings decor and signs each franchisee has discretion to determine the prices to be charged to customers we also provide ongoing support to our franchisees including training marketing assistance and consultation to franchisees who experience financial or operational difficulties we have established several advisory boards through which franchisees contribute to developing systemwide initiatives 

marketing operations 

in our recent history depending on the fiscal year our domestic stores have contributed 4 or 5 of their retail sales to fund national marketing and advertising campaigns with additional required contributions to marketlevel programs during 2009 all domestic franchisees amended their master franchise agreements to require a contribution of 55 of their retail sales to fund national marketing and advertising campaigns and to eliminate the required marketlevel contributions management currently anticipates this 55 contribution rate which began in 2010 will remain in place for the foreseeable future in those markets where we have cooperative advertising programs our domestic stores are still able to contribute to marketlevel media campaigns at their discretion these national and marketlevel funds are administered by domino’s national advertising fund inc or dnaf our notforprofit advertising subsidiary the funds remitted to dnaf are used primarily to purchase media for advertising but also support market research field communications public relations commercial production talent payments and other activities supporting the domino’s pizza ® brand dnaf also provides costeffective print materials to our domestic stores for use in local marketing that reinforce our national branding strategy in addition to the national and marketlevel advertising contributions domestic stores spend additional amounts on local store marketing including targeted database mailings saturation print mailings and community involvement through school and civic organizations additionally we may from timetotime partner with other organizations in an effort to promote the domino’s pizza ® brand 

  

by communicating a common brand message at the national local market and store levels we create and reinforce a powerful consistent marketing message to consumers this is evidenced by our current marketing campaign with the slogan “oh yes we did” since introducing our improved pizza recipe and this new marketing campaign in the fourth quarter of 2009 we have received significant attention in the news media social networking internet sites and other media outlets and have experienced positive same store sales growth in our domestic stores additionally in june 2010 pizza today  the leading publication of the pizza industry named domino’s its “chain of the year” – making the company a twotime winner of the honor which it previously received in 2003 over the past five years we estimate that domestic stores have invested approximately 14 billion on national local and cooperative advertising in the united states 

internationally marketing efforts are primarily the responsibility of the franchisee in each local market we assist international franchisees with their marketing efforts through marketing workshops and sharing of best practices and successful concepts 

thirdparty suppliers 

we have maintained active relationships of 15 years or more with more than half of our major suppliers our suppliers are required to meet strict quality standards to ensure food safety we review and evaluate our suppliers’ quality assurance programs through among other actions onsite visits third party audits and product evaluations to ensure compliance with our standards we believe that the length and quality of our relationships with suppliers provides us with priority service and quality products at competitive prices 

we believe that two factors have been critical to maintaining longlasting relationships and keeping our purchasing costs low first we are one of the largest domestic volume purchasers of pizzarelated products such as flour cheese sauce and pizza boxes which allows us to maximize leverage with our suppliers when items are put out for bid on a scheduled basis second we use a combination of singlesource and multisource procurement strategies each supply category is evaluated along a number of criteria including value of purchasing leverage consistency of quality and reliability of supply to determine the appropriate number of suppliers 

we currently purchase our pizza cheese from a single supplier under the arrangement with this supplier the supplier agreed to provide an uninterrupted supply of cheese and the company agreed to a fiveyear pricing period during which it agreed to purchase all of its primary pizza cheese for the company’s domestic stores from this supplier or alternatively pay to the supplier an amount reflecting any benefit previously received by the company under the new pricing terms the pricing schedule is directly correlated to the chicago mercantile exchange cme block cheddar price the majority of our meat toppings come from a single supplier under a contract that began in november 2010 and expires in october 2013 we have the right to terminate these arrangements for quality failures and for uncured breaches 

we believe that alternative suppliers for all of these ingredients are available and all of our pizza boxes sauces and other ingredients are sourced from various suppliers while we may incur additional costs if we are required to replace any of our suppliers we do not believe that such additional costs would have a material adverse effect on our business we also entered into a multiyear agreement with cocacola effective january 1 2003 for the contiguous united states the contract provides for cocacola to be our exclusive beverage supplier and expires at such time as a minimum number of cases of cocacola ® products are purchased by us we continually evaluate each supply category to determine the optimal sourcing strategy 

we have not experienced any significant shortages of supplies or any delays in receiving our food or beverage inventories restaurant supplies or products prices charged to us by our suppliers are subject to fluctuation and we have historically been able to pass increased costs and savings on to our stores we may periodically enter into financial instruments to manage the risk from changes in commodity prices we do not engage in speculative transactions nor do we hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes 

competition 

us and international pizza delivery and carryout are highly competitive domestically we compete against regional and local companies as well as national chains pizza hut ®  papa john’s ® and little caesars pizza ®  internationally we compete primarily against pizza hut ® and countryspecific national and local companies we generally compete on the basis of product quality location image service and price we also compete on a broader scale with quick service and other international national regional and local restaurants in addition the overall food service industry and the qsr sector in particular are intensely competitive with respect to product quality price service convenience and concept the industry is often affected by changes in consumer tastes economic conditions demographic trends and consumers’ disposable income we compete within the food service industry and the qsr sector not only for customers but also for personnel suitable real estate sites and qualified franchisees 

  

government regulation

 item 1a risk factors 

the pizza category is highly competitive and such competition could adversely affect our operating results 

we compete in the united states against three national chains as well as many regional and local businesses we could experience increased competition from existing or new companies in the pizza category which could create increasing pressures to grow our business in order to maintain our market share if we are unable to maintain our competitive position we could experience downward pressure on prices lower demand for our products reduced margins the inability to take advantage of new business opportunities and the loss of market share all of which would have an adverse effect on our operating results and could cause our stock price to decline 

we also compete on a broader scale with quick service and other international national regional and local restaurants the overall food service market and the quick service restaurant sector are intensely competitive with respect to food quality price service image convenience and concept and are often affected by changes in 

• consumer tastes 

• national regional or local economic conditions 

• disposable purchasing power 

• demographic trends and 

• currency fluctuations related to our international operations 

we compete within the food service market and the quick service restaurant sector not only for customers but also for management and hourly employees suitable real estate sites and qualified franchisees our domestic supply chain segment is also subject to competition from outside suppliers if other suppliers who meet our qualification standards were to offer lower prices or better service to our franchisees for their ingredients and supplies and as a result our franchisees chose not to purchase from our domestic supply chain centers our financial condition business and results of operations would be adversely affected 

if we fail to successfully implement our growth strategy which includes opening new domestic and international stores our ability to increase our revenues and operating profits could be adversely affected 

a significant component of our growth strategy includes the opening of new domestic and international stores we and our franchisees face many challenges in opening new stores including among others 

• availability of financing with acceptable terms 

• selection and availability of suitable store locations 

• negotiation of acceptable lease or financing terms 

• securing required domestic or foreign governmental permits and approvals 

• employment and training of qualified personnel and 

• general economic and business conditions 

the opening of additional franchise stores also depends in part upon the availability of prospective franchisees who meet our criteria our failure to add a significant number of new stores would adversely affect our ability to increase revenues and operating income 

  

we are currently planning to expand our international operations in many of the markets where we currently operate and in selected new markets this may require considerable management time as well as startup expenses for market development before any significant revenues and earnings are generated operations in new foreign markets may achieve low margins or may be unprofitable and expansion in existing markets may be affected by local economic and market conditions therefore as we expand internationally we or our franchisees may not experience the operating margins we expect our results of operations may be negatively impacted and our common stock price may decline 

we may also pursue strategic acquisitions as part of our business if we are able to identify acquisition candidates such acquisitions may be financed to the extent permitted under our debt agreements with substantial debt or with potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities 

the food service market is affected by consumer preferences and perceptions changes in these preferences and perceptions may lessen the demand for our products which would reduce sales and harm our business 

food service businesses are affected by changes in consumer tastes national regional and local economic conditions and demographic trends for instance if prevailing health or dietary preferences cause consumers to avoid pizza and other products we offer in favor of foods that are perceived as more healthy our business and operating results would be harmed moreover because we are primarily dependent on a single product if consumer demand for pizza should decrease our business would suffer more than if we had a more diversified menu as many other food service businesses do 

increases in food labor and other costs could adversely affect our profitability and operating results 

an increase in our operating costs could adversely affect our profitability factors such as inflation increased food costs increased labor and employee benefit costs increased rent costs and increased energy costs may adversely affect our operating costs most of the factors affecting costs are beyond our control and in many cases we may not be able to pass along these increased costs to our customers or franchisees most ingredients used in our pizza particularly cheese are subject to significant price fluctuations as a result of seasonality weather demand and other factors the cheese block price per pound averaged 150 in 2010 and the estimated increase in companyowned store food costs from a hypothetical 025 adverse change in the average cheese block price per pound would have been approximately 22 million in 2010 labor costs are largely a function of the minimum wage for a majority of our store personnel and certain supply chain center personnel and generally are also a function of the availability of labor food including cheese costs and labor represent approximately 50 to 60 of a typical companyowned store’s sales 

we do not have longterm contracts with certain of our suppliers and as a result they could seek to significantly increase prices or fail to deliver 

we do not have written contracts or formal longterm arrangements with certain of our suppliers although in the past we have not experienced significant problems with our suppliers our suppliers may implement significant price increases or may not meet our requirements in a timely fashion or at all the occurrence of any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

shortages or interruptions in the supply or delivery of fresh food products could adversely affect our operating results 

we and our franchisees are dependent on frequent deliveries of fresh food products that meet our specifications shortages or interruptions in the supply of fresh food products caused by unanticipated demand problems in production or distribution financial or other difficulties of suppliers inclement weather or other conditions could adversely affect the availability quality and cost of ingredients which would adversely affect our operating results 

any prolonged disruption in the operations of any of our dough manufacturing and supply chain centers could harm our business 

we operate 16 regional dough manufacturing and supply chain centers one thin crust manufacturing center and one vegetable processing supply chain center in the contiguous united states and a total of six dough manufacturing and supply chain centers in alaska hawaii and canada our domestic dough manufacturing and supply chain centers service all of our companyowned stores and over 99 of our domestic franchise stores as a result any prolonged disruption in the operations of any of these facilities whether due to technical or labor difficulties destruction or damage to the facility real estate issues or other reasons could adversely affect our business and operating results 

  

we face risks of litigation and negative publicity from customers franchisees employees and others in the ordinary course of business which diverts our financial and management resources any adverse litigation or publicity may negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations 

claims of illness or injury relating to food quality or food handling are common in the food service industry in addition class action lawsuits have been filed and may continue to be filed against various quick service restaurants alleging among other things that quick service restaurants have failed to disclose the health risks associated with highfat foods and that quick service restaurant marketing practices have encouraged obesity in addition to decreasing our sales and profitability and diverting our management resources adverse publicity or a substantial judgment against us could negatively impact our financial condition results of operations and brand reputation thereby hindering our ability to attract and retain franchisees and grow our business 

further we may be subject to employee franchisee and other claims in the future based on among other things discrimination harassment wrongful termination and wage rest break and meal break issues and those claims relating to overtime compensation we have been subject to these types of claims in the past if one or more of these claims were to be successful or if there is a significant increase in the number of these claims or if we receive significant negative publicity our business financial condition and operating results could be harmed 

loss of key personnel or our inability to attract and retain new qualified personnel could hurt our business and inhibit our ability to operate and grow successfully 

our success in the highly competitive business of pizza delivery will continue to depend to a significant extent on our leadership team and other key management personnel other than with our president and chief executive officer j patrick doyle we do not have longterm employment agreements with any of our executive officers as a result we may not be able to retain our executive officers and key personnel or attract additional qualified management while we do not have longterm employment agreements with our executive officers for eight of our eleven executive officers we have noncompete and nonsolicitation agreements that extend for 24 months following the termination of such executive officer’s employment our success also will continue to depend on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel to operate our stores dough manufacturing and supply chain centers and international operations the loss of these employees or our inability to recruit and retain qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 

our international operations subject us to additional risk such risks and costs may differ in each country in which we do business and may cause our profitability to decline due to increased costs 

we conduct a growing portion of our business outside the united states our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected if global markets in which our franchise stores compete are affected by changes in political economic or other factors these factors over which neither we nor our franchisees have control may include 

• recessionary or expansive trends in international markets 

• changing labor conditions and difficulties in staffing and managing our foreign operations 

• increases in the taxes we pay and other changes in applicable tax laws 

• legal and regulatory changes and the burdens and costs of our compliance with a variety of foreign laws 

• changes in inflation rates 

• changes in exchange rates and the imposition of restrictions on currency conversion or the transfer of funds 

• difficulty in collecting our royalties and longer payment cycles 

• expropriation of private enterprises 

• political and economic instability and 

• other external factors 

fluctuations in the value of the us dollar in relation to other currencies may lead to lower revenues and earnings 

exchange rate fluctuations could have an adverse effect on our results of operations approximately 100 of our total revenues in 2008 105 of our total revenues in 2009 and 112 of our revenues in 2010 were derived from our international segment a majority of which were denominated in foreign currencies sales made by franchise stores outside the united states are denominated in the currency of the country in which the store is located and this currency could become less valuable prior to conversion to us dollars as a result of exchange rate fluctuations unfavorable currency fluctuations could lead to increased prices to customers outside the united states or lower profitability to our franchisees outside the united states or could result in lower revenues for us on a us dollar basis from such customers and franchisees a hypothetical 10 adverse change in the foreign currency rates in each of our top ten international markets based on store count would have resulted in a negative impact of approximately 67 million in 2010 

  

we may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property which could harm the value of our brand and branded products and adversely affect our business 

we depend in large part on our brand and branded products and believe that they are very important to our business we rely on a combination of trademarks copyrights service marks trade secrets and similar intellectual property rights to protect our brand and branded products the success of our business depends on our continued ability to use our existing trademarks and service marks in order to increase brand awareness and further develop our branded products in both domestic and international markets we have registered certain trademarks and have other trademark registrations pending in the united states and foreign jurisdictions not all of the trademarks that we currently use have been registered in all of the countries in which we do business and they may never be registered in all of these countries we may not be able to adequately protect our trademarks and our use of these trademarks may result in liability for trademark infringement trademark dilution or unfair competition all of the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property in the united states and in foreign countries may not be adequate in addition the laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states further through acquisitions of third parties we may acquire brands and related trademarks that are subject to the same risks as the brands and trademarks we currently own 

we may from time to time be required to institute litigation to enforce our trademarks or other intellectual property rights or to protect our trade secrets such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could negatively affect our sales profitability and prospects regardless of whether we are able to successfully enforce our rights 

our earnings and business growth strategy depends on the success of our franchisees and we may be harmed by actions taken by our franchisees or employees of our franchisees that are outside of our control 

a significant portion of our earnings comes from royalties generated by our franchise stores franchisees are independent operators and their employees are not our employees we provide limited training and support to franchisees but the quality of franchise store operations may be diminished by any number of factors beyond our control consequently franchisees may not successfully operate stores in a manner consistent with our standards and requirements or may not hire and train qualified managers and other store personnel if they do not our image and reputation may suffer and as a result our revenues and stock price could decline while we try to ensure that our franchisees maintain the quality of our brand and branded products our franchisees may take actions that adversely affect the value of our intellectual property or reputation as of january 2 2011 we had 1117 domestic franchisees operating 4475 domestic stores seven of these franchisees each operate over 50 domestic stores including our largest domestic franchisee who operates 144 stores and the average franchisee owns and operates four stores in addition our international master franchisees are generally responsible for the development of significantly more stores than our domestic franchisees as a result our international operations are more closely tied to the success of a smaller number of franchisees than our domestic operations our largest international master franchisee operates 815 stores in five markets which accounts for approximately 18 of our total international store count our domestic and international franchisees may not operate their franchises successfully if one or more of our key franchisees were to become insolvent or otherwise were unable or unwilling to pay us our royalties or other amounts owed our business and results of operations would be adversely affected 

interruption failure or compromise of our information technology communications systems and electronic data could hurt our ability to effectively serve our customers and protect customer data which could damage our reputation and adversely affect our business and operating results 

an increasingly significant portion of our retail sales depends on the continuing operation of our information technology and communications systems including but not limited to domino’s pulse™ our online ordering platform and our credit card processing systems our information technology communication systems and electronic data may be vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes terrorist attacks floods fires power loss telecommunications failures computer viruses loss of data unauthorized data breaches or other attempts to harm our systems additionally we operate data centers that are also subject to breakins sabotage and intentional acts of vandalism that could cause disruptions in our ability to serve our customers and protect customer data some of our systems are not fully redundant and our disaster recovery planning cannot account for all eventualities the occurrence of a natural disaster intentional sabotage or other unanticipated problems could result in lengthy interruptions in our service any errors or vulnerabilities in our systems or damage to or failure of our systems could result in interruptions in our services and noncompliance with certain regulations which could reduce our revenues and profits and damage our business and brand 

  

we are subject to extensive government regulation and requirements issued by other groups and our failure to comply with existing or increased regulations could adversely affect our business and operating results 

we are subject to numerous federal state local and foreign laws and regulations as well as requirements issued by other groups including those relating to 

• the preparation and sale of food 

• building and zoning requirements 

• environmental protection 

• minimum wage overtime and other labor requirements 

• compliance with securities laws and new york stock exchange listed company rules 

• compliance with the americans with disabilities act 

• working and safety conditions 

• menu labeling and other nutritional requirements 

• compliance with the payment card industry data security standards pci dss and similar requirements 

• compliance with the patient protection and affordability care act and subsequent amendments and 

• compliance with the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act 

we may become subject to legislation or regulation seeking to tax andor regulate highfat foods if we fail to comply with existing or future laws and regulations we may be subject to governmental or judicial fines or sanctions in addition our capital expenditures could increase due to remediation measures that may be required if we are found to be noncompliant with any of these laws or regulations 

we are also subject to a federal trade commission rule and to various state and foreign laws that govern the offer and sale of franchises additionally these laws regulate various aspects of the franchise relationship including terminations and the refusal to renew franchises the failure to comply with these laws and regulations in any jurisdiction or to obtain required government approvals could result in a ban or temporary suspension on future franchise sales fines or other penalties or require us to make offers of rescission or restitution any of which could adversely affect our business and operating results 

our current insurance coverage may not be adequate insurance premiums for such coverage may increase and we may not be able to obtain insurance at acceptable rates or at all 

we have retention programs for workers’ compensation general liability and owned and nonowned automobile liabilities we are generally responsible for up to 10 million per occurrence under these retention programs for workers’ compensation and general liability we are also generally responsible for between 500000 and 30 million per occurrence under these retention programs for owned and nonowned automobile liabilities total insurance limits under these retention programs vary depending upon the period covered and range up to 1100 million per occurrence for general liability and owned and nonowned automobile liabilities and up to the applicable statutory limits for workers’ compensation these insurance policies may not be adequate to protect us from liabilities that we incur in our business in addition in the future our insurance premiums may increase and we may not be able to obtain similar levels of insurance on reasonable terms or at all any such inadequacy of or inability to obtain insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations we are not required to and do not specifically set aside funds for our retention programs 

our annual and quarterly financial results are subject to significant fluctuations depending on various factors many of which are beyond our control and if we fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors our share price may decline significantly 

our sales and operating results can vary significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year depending on various factors many of which are beyond our control these factors include among other things 

• variations in the timing and volume of our sales and our franchisees’ sales 

• the timing of expenditures in anticipation of future sales 

• sales promotions by us and our competitors 

• changes in competitive and economic conditions generally 

• changes in the cost or availability of our ingredients or labor and 

• foreign currency exposure 

as a result our operational performance may decline quickly and significantly in response to changes in order patterns or rapid decreases in demand for our products we anticipate that fluctuations in operating results will continue in the future 

  

our common stock price could be subject to significant fluctuations andor may decline 

the market price of our common stock could be subject to significant fluctuations among the factors that could affect our stock price are 

• variations in our operating results 

• changes in revenues or earnings estimates or publication of research reports by analysts 

• speculation in the press or investment community 

• strategic actions by us or our competitors such as sales promotions acquisitions or restructurings 

• actions by institutional and other stockholders 

• changes in our dividend policy 

• changes in the market values of public companies that operate in our business segments 

• general market conditions and 

• domestic and international economic factors unrelated to our performance 

the stock markets in general have recently experienced volatility that has sometimes been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies these broad market fluctuations may cause the trading price of our common stock to decline 

our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our business and limit our ability to plan for or respond to changes in our business 

as a result of the 2007 recapitalization we hold a substantial amount of indebtedness and are highly leveraged as of january 2 2011 our consolidated longterm indebtedness was approximately 145 billion we may also incur additional debt which would not be prohibited under the terms of the securitized debt agreements our substantial indebtedness could have important consequences to our business and our shareholders for example it could 

• make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our debt agreements 

• increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions 

• require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow for other purposes and 

• limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and the industry in which we operate thereby placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that may have less debt 

in addition the financial and other covenants we agreed to with our lenders may limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness make investments pay dividends and engage in other transactions and the leverage may cause potential lenders to be less willing to loan funds to us in the future our failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default that if not cured or waived could result in the acceleration of repayment of all of our indebtedness 

we may be unable to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our significant debt service obligations which would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

our ability to make principal and interest payments on and to refinance our indebtedness will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future this to a certain extent is subject to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control if our business does not generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the amounts projected or at all or if future borrowings are not available to us under our variable funding notes in amounts sufficient to fund our other liquidity needs our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected if we cannot generate sufficient cash flow from operations to make scheduled principal and interest payments on our debt obligations in the future we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity sell assets delay capital expenditures or seek additional equity if we are unable to refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all or to effect any other action relating to our indebtedness on satisfactory terms or at all our business may be harmed 

  

the terms of our securitized debt financing of certain of our whollyowned subsidiaries have restrictive terms and our failure to comply with any of these terms could put us in default which would have an adverse effect on our business and prospects 

unless and until we repay all outstanding borrowings under our securitized debt we will remain subject to the restrictive terms of these borrowings the securitized debt under which certain of our whollyowned subsidiaries issued and guaranteed senior and subordinated fixed rate notes and variable funding senior revolving notes contain a number of covenants with the most significant financial covenant being a debt service coverage calculation these covenants limit the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to among other things 

• sell assets 

• alter the business we conduct 

• engage in mergers acquisitions and other business combinations 

• declare dividends or redeem or repurchase capital stock 

• incur assume or permit to exist additional indebtedness or guarantees 

• make loans and investments 

• incur liens and 

• enter into transactions with affiliates 

the securitized debt also requires us to maintain a specified financial ratio at the end of each fiscal quarter these restrictions could affect our ability to pay dividends or repurchase shares of our common stock our ability to meet this financial ratio can be affected by events beyond our control and we may not satisfy such a test a breach of this covenant could result in a rapid amortization event or default under the securitized debt if amounts owed under the securitized debt are accelerated because of a default under the securitized debt and we are unable to pay such amounts the insurers have the right to assume control of substantially all of the securitized assets 

in the event that one or both of the insurance companies that provide financial guaranties of our fixed and variable funding note payments were to become the subject of insolvency or similar proceedings our lenders would not be required to fund our variable funding notes additionally under the terms of our indenture governing our notes an event of default would occur if i one or both of the insurance companies were to become the subject of insolvency or similar proceedings and ii the related insurance policies were not continued or sold to a third party who would assume one or both of the insurance companies’ obligations under the related policies but instead were terminated or canceled as a result of those proceedings in an event of default all unpaid amounts under the fixed and variable rate notes could become immediately due and payable at the direction or consent of holders of a majority of the outstanding fixed rate notes or the remaining insurance company that is not the subject of insolvency or similar proceedings such acceleration of our debt could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity if we were unable to negotiate mutually acceptable terms with our lenders or if alternate funding were not available to us 

during the first five years following issuance the senior notes will accrue interest at a fixed rate of 5261 per year and the subordinated notes will accrue interest at a fixed rate of 7629 if we are not able to exercise either of our two oneyear extension options following the fiveyear interestonly period our securitized debt will be subject to principal amortization and may also be subject to an increased interest rate if it is not repaid or refinanced if we do exercise one or both extensions we will be subject to an increased interest rate of at least 025 

if we are unable to refinance or repay amounts under the securitized debt prior to the expiration of the fiveyear interestonly term six or sevenyear interestonly term if we satisfy certain conditions and exercise one or both of our oneyear extension elections our cash flow would be directed to the repayment of the securitized debt and other than a weekly servicing fee sufficient to cover minimal selling general and administrative expenses would not be available for operating our business 

no assurance can be given that any refinancing or additional financing will be possible when needed or that we will be able to negotiate acceptable terms in addition our access to capital is affected by prevailing conditions in the financial and capital markets and other factors beyond our control there can be no assurance that market conditions will be favorable at the times that we require new or additional financing 

the indenture governing the securitized debt will restrict the cash flow from the entities subject to the securitization to any of our other entities and upon the occurrence of certain events cash flow would be further restricted 

in the event that a rapid amortization event occurs under the indenture including without limitation upon an event of default under the indenture or the failure to repay the securitized debt at the end of the five year interestonly period or at the end of any extension period the funds available to us would be reduced or eliminated which would in turn reduce our ability to operate or grow our business

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

overview 

our fiscal year typically includes 52 weeks comprised of three twelveweek quarters and one sixteenweek quarter every five or six years our fiscal year includes an extra or 53 rd  week in the fourth quarter fiscal 2009 consisted of 53 weeks while fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2010 consisted of 52 weeks 

description of the business 

we are the number one pizza delivery company in the united states with a 198 share of the pizza delivery market based on reported consumer spending and the second largest pizza company in the world based on number of units we also have a leading international presence we operate through a network of 454 companyowned stores all of which are in the united states and 8897 franchise stores located in all 50 states and in more than 65 international markets in addition we operate 16 regional dough manufacturing and supply chain centers in the contiguous united states as well as six dough manufacturing and supply chain centers outside the contiguous united states 

our financial results are driven largely by retail sales at our companyowned and franchise stores changes in retail sales are driven by changes in same store sales and store counts we monitor both of these metrics very closely as they directly impact our revenues and profits and strive to consistently increase both same store sales and our store counts retail sales drive companyowned store revenues royalty payments from franchisees and supply chain revenues retail sales are primarily impacted by the strength of the domino’s pizza ® brand the results of our marketing promotions our ability to execute our store operating model the overall global economic environment and level of success of our other business strategies 

we devote significant attention to our brandbuilding efforts which is evident in our system’s estimated 14 billion of domestic advertising spending over the past five years and our frequent designation as a megabrand by advertising age  we plan on continuing to build our brand and retail sales by satisfying customers worldwide with our pizza delivery offerings and by continuing to invest significant amounts in the advertising and marketing of the domino’s pizza ® brand in 2010 pizza today  the leading publication of the pizza industry named domino’s its “chain of the year” – making the company a twotime winner of the honor which it previously received in 2003 

we also pay particular attention to the store economics or the investment performance of a store to its owner of both our companyowned and franchise stores we believe that our system’s favorable store economics benefit from the relatively small initial and ongoing investments required to own and operate a domino’s pizza store this was also highlighted by forbes  a leading source of business news and financial information in its list of “the top franchises for the money” for 2010 where domino’s pizza was ranked 1 in the united states we believe these favorable investment requirements coupled with a strong brand message supported by significant advertising spending as well as highquality and focused menu offerings drive strong store economics which in turn drive demand for new stores 

business performance 

over the past several years we have focused on improving our company through several initiatives domestically including investments to improve upon our menu marketing technology operations and franchise base our menu improvements included launching new product platforms in the united states such as our domino’s oven baked sandwiches and our domino’s american legends ® pizzas domino’s breadbowl pasta™ and chocolate lava crunch cakes in late 2009 we launched our improved pizza recipe which received significant media attention and resulted in positive increases in traffic and sales in our domestic stores throughout 2010 we believe our new pizza recipe resonated with existing and new customers and drove both trial and repeat orders throughout 2010 as evidenced by our 99 domestic same store sales growth in 2010 the new pizza recipe combined with an innovative and effective advertising campaign continued focus on operational excellence and efforts to strengthen our franchisee base resulted in positive customer traffic throughout 2010 additionally we have continued to work towards positive domestic store growth over the past several years and in 2010 we posted positive net domestic store growth for the first time since 2007 

our international division continued to post strong same store sales growth 69 in 2010 and had a record 350 net store openings including stores in bulgaria germany romania ukraine and vietnam which were new market openings in 2010 continued strong same store sales growth combined with continued store count growth demonstrate the consistency and reliability of this growing business segment 

  

these strong results from both our domestic and international stores produced earnings per share growth and increased excess cash flows in 2010 we believe we improved store economics and positioned ourselves well for the future through our new product platforms and investments made in the company including marketing and technology initiatives 

in 2010 global retail sales which are total retail sales at companyowned and franchise stores worldwide increased 114 as compared to 2009 retail sales for franchise stores are reported to the company by its franchisees and are not included in company revenues this increase was driven primarily by both domestic and international same store sales growth as well as an increase in our worldwide store counts during the trailing four quarters and to a lesser extent the positive impact of foreign currency exchange rates on our international sales domestic same store sales growth reflected the success of our improved pizza the effectiveness of our advertising and our continued focus on operational excellence international same store sales growth reflected continued strong performance in the markets where we compete these increases to global retail sales were offset in part by the inclusion of the 53 rd week in 2009 in 2009 global retail sales increased 22 as compared to 2008 driven primarily by the 25 percentage point benefit of the 53 rd week in 2009 additionally global retail sales in 2009 benefited from strong international same store sales growth same store sales growth in our domestic franchise stores and growth in worldwide store counts these increases were offset in part by the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates on our international sales 

revenues increased 1668 million or 119 in 2010 and decreased 210 million or 15 in 2009 the increase in revenues in 2010 was driven by higher domestic supply chain revenues resulting from increased volumes and higher commodity prices including cheese higher same store sales domestically and abroad and international store count growth these increases in 2010 were offset in part by the inclusion of the 53 rd week in 2009 the decrease in revenues in 2009 from 2008 was largely due to lower companyowned store revenues resulting primarily from the impact of the store divestitures in 2008 lower domestic supply chain revenues due primarily to lower food prices including cheese and the negative impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on our international revenues these decreases were offset in part by the 344 million positive impact of the inclusion of the 53 rd week in 2009 

worldwide store counts have increased from 8624 at the beginning of 2008 to 9351 at the end of 2010 this growth in store counts can be attributed to the global growth of our brand and our pizza delivery concept as well as the economics inherent in our system which attract new franchisees and encourages existing franchisees to grow their business domestic same store sales decreased 49 in 2008 increased 05 in 2009 and increased 99 in 2010 international same store sales increased 62 43 and 69 during the same periods the significant increase in domestic same store sales in 2010 was attributable to our innovative and effective advertising campaign for our improved pizza recipe continued focus on operational excellence and efforts to strengthen our franchisee base over the past several years the company experienced traffic increases in both our domestic companyowned and franchise stores in all four quarters of 2010 internationally same stores sales growth continues to result from the growing acceptance of pizza and delivered pizza around the globe and the successful execution of the domino’s pizza concept domestic same store sales in fiscal 2009 reflected the success of several initiatives including the launch of two new product platforms domino’s breadbowl pasta™ and domino’s american legends ® pizzas as well as the introduction of domino’s chocolate lava crunch cakes and the introduction of our improved pizza recipe during the fourth quarter of 2009 the company’s domestic same store sales results in 2008 reflected the underperformance of our product and promotional offerings during those years continued challenges in our domestic business and a weak consumer environment 

income from operations increased 382 million or 202 in 2010 and decreased 55 million or 28 in 2009 the increase in 2010 was due primarily to higher royalty revenues from domestic and international franchise stores and larger volumes in our supply chain business additionally income from operations in 2010 benefited from higher domestic companyowned store margins and approximately 49 million of expenses incurred in 2009 in connection with the company’s equity incentive plan changes that did not recur in 2010 these increases were offset in part by higher variable general and administrative expenses including higher performancebased bonuses as a result of our strong operating performance as well as continued investments in growth initiatives additionally the comparable results for 2010 were negatively impacted by the inclusion of the 53 rd week in 2009 the decrease in income from operations in 2009 from 2008 was due primarily to the negative impact of approximately 49 million of expenses incurred in connection with the company’s equity incentive plan changes furthermore 2009 was negatively impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates affecting our international operations and higher variable bonuses related to the company’s bonus program these decreases in 2009 from 2008 were offset in part by the inclusion of the 53 rd week in 2009 which benefited income from operations by approximately 67 million by higher margins in our companyowned stores and domestic supply chain business as well as domestic and international same store sales growth and store count growth in our international markets 

  

net income increased 82 million or 102 in 2010 and increased 258 million or 478 in 2009 the increase in 2010 was due primarily to the aforementioned increase in income from operations lower interest expense resulting from lower debt balances and the positive impact of a lower effective tax rate offset in part by lower pretax gains recorded on the extinguishment of debt and the negative impact of the 53 rd week in 2009 the increase in net income in 2009 was due primarily to 563 million of pretax gains recorded on the extinguishment of debt combined with lower interest expense in 2009 as a result of lower debt levels additionally the inclusion of the 53 rd week benefited net income in 2009 by approximately 29 million these increases were partially offset by the aforementioned decrease in income from operations 

we are highly leveraged primarily as a result of our recapitalization in 2007 as of january 2 2011 consolidated debt was 145 billion historically a large portion of our cash flows from operations has been used to make principal and interest payments on our indebtedness as well as distributions to shareholders in the form of dividends and stock repurchases our securitized debt requires interestonly payments until april 2012 this interestonly period can be extended for two oneyear periods if the company meets certain requirements in april 2012 and april 2013 based on fiscal 2010 financial results the company currently exceeds the required threshold for extension that will be evaluated in april 2012 and april 2013 management currently expects to have the option to take advantage of these interestonly periods at the extension assessment dates overall we believe that our ability to consistently produce significant excess cash flows allows us the flexibility not only to service our debt but also to invest in our growing business as well as return cash to our shareholders 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america the preparation of these financial statements requires our management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis our management evaluates its estimates including those related to revenue recognition allowance for uncollectible receivables longlived and intangible assets insurance and legal matters sharebased payments and income taxes we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from those estimates changes in our accounting policies and estimates could materially impact our results of operations and financial condition for any particular period we believe that our most critical accounting policies and estimates are 

revenue recognition  we earn revenues through our network of domestic companyowned and franchise stores dough manufacturing and supply chain centers and international operations retail sales from companyowned stores and royalty revenues resulting from the retail sales from franchise stores are recognized as revenues when the items are delivered to or carried out by customers retail sales are generally reported and related royalties paid to the company on a weekly basis based on a percentage of retail sales as specified in the related standard franchise agreement generally 55 of domestic franchise retail sales in the event that retail sales are not reported timely by a franchisee the company will record royalty revenues in the period earned based on an estimate of the franchisee’s sales however these estimates are not significant and have historically been materially consistent with the actual amounts revenues from companyowned stores and royalty revenues from franchise stores fluctuate from timetotime as a result of store count changes for example if a companyowned store that generated 500000 in revenue in fiscal 2009 is sold to a franchisee in fiscal 2010 revenues from companyowned stores would have declined by 500000 in fiscal 2010 while franchise royalty revenues would have increased by only 27500 in fiscal 2010 as we generally collect 55 of a domestic franchisee’s retail sales sales of food from our supply chain centers are recognized as revenues upon delivery of the food to franchisees while sales of equipment and supplies are generally recognized as revenues upon shipment of the related products to franchisees 

allowance for uncollectible receivables we closely monitor our accounts and notes receivable balances and provide allowances for uncollectible amounts as a result of our reviews these estimates are based on among other factors historical collection experience and a review of our receivables by aging category additionally we may also provide allowances for uncollectible receivables based on specific customer collection issues that we have identified while writeoffs of bad debts have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established management cannot guarantee that future writeoffs will not exceed historical rates specifically if the financial condition of our franchisees were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments additional allowances may be required 

  

at january 2 2011 our total allowance for uncollectible accounts receivables was approximately 64 million compared to 92 million as of january 3 2010 representing approximately 74 and 108 of our consolidated gross accounts receivable at those respective yearends a 10 change in our allowance for uncollectible accounts receivables at january 2 2011 would result in a change in reserves of approximately 06 million and a change in income before provision for income taxes by the same amount currently management does not believe that there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions that were used to calculate our allowance for uncollectible accounts receivables 

longlived and intangible assets we record longlived assets including property plant and equipment and capitalized software at cost for acquisitions of franchise operations we estimate the fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired based on physical inspection of assets historical experience and other information available to us regarding the acquisition we depreciate and amortize longlived assets using useful lives determined by us based on historical experience and other information available to us we evaluate the potential impairment of longlived assets based on various analyses including the projection of undiscounted cash flows whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable for companyowned stores we perform related impairment tests on an operating market basis which the company has determined to be the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of other cash flows if the carrying amount of a longlived asset exceeds the amount of the expected future undiscounted cash flows of that asset or the estimated fair value of the asset an impairment loss is recognized and the asset is written down to its estimated fair value 

we have not made any significant changes in the methodology used to estimate the future market cash flows of companyowned stores during the years presented same store sales fluctuations and the rates at which operating costs will fluctuate in the future are key factors in evaluating recoverability of the related assets if our same store sales significantly decline or if operating costs increase and we are unable to recover these costs the carrying value of our companyowned stores by market may be unrecoverable and we may be required to recognize an impairment charge at january 2 2011 we determined that our longlived assets were not impaired 

a significant portion of our goodwill relates to acquisitions of domestic franchise stores and is included in our domestic stores segment specifically the companyowned stores reporting unit we evaluate goodwill annually for impairment by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit which is primarily determined using the present value of historical cash flows to its carrying value if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value goodwill would be impaired we have not made any significant changes in the methodology used to evaluate goodwill impairment during the years presented at january 2 2011 the fair value of our business operations with associated goodwill exceeded their recorded carrying value including the related goodwill if cash flows generated by our companyowned stores were to decline significantly in the future or there were negative revisions to the market multiple assumption we may be required to recognize a goodwill impairment charge however based on the latest impairment analysis we do not believe it is reasonably likely that there could be changes in assumptions that would trigger impairment 

insurance and legal matters we are a party to lawsuits and legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business management closely monitors these legal matters and estimates the probable costs for the resolution of such matters these estimates are primarily determined by consulting with both internal and external parties handling the matters and are based upon an analysis of potential results assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies while historically our actual losses have been materially consistent with our reserves legal judgments can be volatile and difficult to predict accordingly if our estimates relating to legal matters proved inaccurate for any reason we may be required to increase or decrease the related expense in future periods we had accruals for legal matters of approximately 45 million at january 3 2010 and approximately 66 million at january 2 2011 

for certain periods prior to december 1998 and for periods after december 2001 we maintain insurance coverage for workers’ compensation general liability and owned and nonowned auto liability under insurance policies requiring payment of a deductible for each occurrence up to between 500000 and 30 million depending on the policy year and line of coverage the related insurance reserves are based on undiscounted independent actuarial estimates which are based on historical information along with assumptions about future events specifically various methods including analyses of historical trends and actuarial valuation methods are utilized to estimate the cost to settle reported claims and claims incurred but not yet reported the actuarial valuation methods develop estimates of the future ultimate claim costs based on the claims incurred as of the balance sheet date when estimating these liabilities several factors are considered including the severity duration and frequency of claims legal cost associated with claims healthcare trends and projected inflation over the past several years we have experienced improvements in frequency of claims however increasing severity of claims and medical costs has partially offset these trends 

  

our methodology for determining our exposure has remained consistent throughout the years presented management believes that the various assumptions developed and actuarial methods used to determine our self insurance reserves are reasonable and provide meaningful data that management uses to make its best estimate of our exposure to these risks while historically our actual losses have been materially consistent with our reserves changes in assumptions for such factors as medical costs and legal actions as well as changes in actual experience could cause our estimates to change in the near term which could result in an increase or decrease in the related expense in future periods a 10 change in our self insurance liability at january 2 2011 would have affected our income before provision for income taxes by approximately 31 million for fiscal 2010 we had accruals for insurance matters of approximately 272 million at january 3 2010 and 312 million at january 2 2011 

sharebased payments we recognize compensation expense related to our sharebased compensation arrangements over the requisite service period based on the grant date fair value of the awards the grant date fair value of each restricted stock and performancebased restricted stock award is equal to the market price of our stock on the date of grant the grant date fair value of each stock option award is estimated using a blackscholes option pricing model the pricing model requires assumptions including the expected life of the stock option the riskfree interest rate and expected volatility of our stock over the expected life which significantly impact the assumed fair value we are also required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and only recognize expense for those awards expected to vest we use historical data to determine these assumptions additionally our stock option restricted stock and performancebased restricted stock arrangements provide for accelerated vesting and the ability to exercise during the remainder of the tenyear stock option life upon the retirement of individuals holding the awards who have achieved specified service and age requirements management believes that the methods and various assumptions used to determine compensation expense related to these arrangements are reasonable but if the assumptions change significantly for future grants sharebased compensation expense will fluctuate in future years 

income taxes we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities and reserves for uncertain tax positions we measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using current enacted tax rates that will apply in the years in which we expect the temporary differences to be recovered or paid judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes and related reserves deferred tax assets and liabilities these include establishing a valuation allowance related to the ability to realize certain deferred tax assets if necessary as of january 2 2011 we had no valuation allowances recorded for deferred tax assets our accounting for deferred tax assets represents our best estimate of future events our net deferred tax assets assume that we will generate sufficient taxable income in specific tax jurisdictions based on our estimates and assumptions changes in our current estimates due to unanticipated events could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operation 

the amounts relating to taxes recorded on the balance sheet including tax reserves also consider the ultimate resolution of revenue agent reviews based on estimates and assumptions we believe we have adequately accounted for our uncertain tax positions however tax audits changes in tax laws and other unforeseen matters may result in us owing additional taxes we adjust our reserves for uncertain tax positions when facts and circumstances change or due to the passage of time for example the completion of a tax audit or the expiration of a statute of limitations or changes in penalty and interest reserves associated with uncertain tax positions management believes that our tax positions comply with applicable tax law and that we have adequately provided for these matters however to the extent the final tax outcome of these matters is different than our recorded amounts we may be required to adjust our tax reserves resulting in additional income tax expense or benefit in future periods

 2010 compared to 2009 

tabular amounts in millions except percentages 

revenues revenues primarily consist of retail sales from our companyowned stores royalties from our domestic and international franchise stores and sales of food equipment and supplies from our supply chain centers to the majority of our domestic franchise stores and certain international franchise stores companyowned store and franchise store revenues may vary significantly from period to period due to changes in store count mix while supply chain revenues may vary significantly as a result of fluctuations in commodity prices primarily cheese and meats 

consolidated revenues increased 1668 million or 119 in 2010 this increase in revenues was due primarily to higher domestic supply chain revenues resulting from increased volumes and higher commodity prices including cheese higher same store sales domestically and abroad and international store count growth these increases in 2010 were offset in part by the inclusion of the 53 rd week in 2009 which positively impacted revenues by approximately 344 million in 2009 these changes in revenues are more fully described below 

  

domestic stores domestic stores revenues are primarily comprised of retail sales from domestic companyowned store operations as well as royalties from retail sales and other fees from domestic franchise stores as summarized in the following table 

 

 domestic stores revenues increased 254 million or 52 in 2010 this increase was due primarily to higher domestic companyowned and franchise same store sales the increase was offset in part by the estimated 118 million positive impact in 2009 related to the inclusion of the 53 rd week these results are more fully described below 

domestic companyowned stores revenues from domestic companyowned store operations increased 98 million or 29 in 2010 this increase was due to a 97 increase in same store sales compared to 2009 offset in part by a decrease in the average number of companyowned stores open during 2010 and the estimated 82 million positive impact in 2009 related to the inclusion of the 53 rd week there were 466 domestic companyowned stores in operation as of january 3 2010 and 454 domestic companyowned stores in operation as of january 2 2011 

domestic franchise revenues from domestic franchise operations increased 155 million or 99 in 2010 this increase was due primarily to a 100 increase in same store sales compared to 2009 and an increase in fees for other services paid by franchisees offset in part by the estimated 36 million positive impact in 2009 related to the inclusion of the 53 rd week there were 4461 domestic franchise stores in operation as of january 3 2010 and 4475 domestic franchise stores in operation as of january 2 2011 

domestic supply chain revenues from domestic supply chain operations increased 1118 million or 146 in 2010 this increase was due primarily to higher volumes related to growth in domestic retail sales and an increase in overall commodity prices including cheese and meats partially offset by the estimated 192 million positive impact in 2009 related to the inclusion of the 53 rd week cheese prices positively impacted revenues by approximately 164 million in 2010 

international international revenues consist of royalties from our international franchise stores and international supply chain sales revenues from international operations increased 296 million or 202 in 2010 this increase was due primarily to higher international royalty and other revenues and higher international supply chain revenues this increase was positively impacted by approximately 99 million related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and was negatively impacted by the inclusion of the 53 rd week in 2009 which positively impacted total international revenues in 2009 by approximately 35 million these changes in international revenues are more fully described below 

 

 international royalty and other revenues from international royalties and other increased 139 million or 181 in 2010 this increase was due primarily to higher same store sales and an increase in the average number of international stores open during 2010 as well as the positive impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates of approximately 31 million in 2010 on a constant dollar basis which excludes the impact of foreign currency exchange rates same store sales increased 69 in 2010 compared to 2009 on a historical dollar basis which includes the impact of foreign currency exchange rates same store sales increased 114 in 2010 compared to 2009 the variance in our same store sales on a constant dollar basis versus a historical dollar basis in 2010 was caused by the weakening of the us dollar compared to the currencies in the international markets in which we compete there were 4072 international stores in operation as of january 3 2010 and 4422 international stores in operation as of january 2 2011 

international supply chain revenues from international supply chain operations increased 157 million or 225 in 2010 this increase was due primarily to higher volumes and the positive impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates of approximately 68 million in 2010 

cost of sales  operating margin consolidated cost of sales consists primarily of companyowned store and domestic supply chain costs incurred to generate related revenues components of consolidated cost of sales primarily include food labor and occupancy costs 

  

the consolidated operating margin which we define as revenues less cost of sales increased 516 million or 133 in 2010 as summarized in the following table 

 

 the 516 million increase in consolidated operating margin was due primarily to higher franchise royalty revenues as a result of strong global retail sales and higher volumes and margins in our domestic supply chain and domestic companyowned store businesses both as described in more detail below additionally the increase in the consolidated operating margin was offset in part by the estimated 104 million positive impact in 2009 related to the inclusion of the 53 rd week franchise revenues do not have a cost of sales component and as such changes in franchise revenues have a disproportionate effect on the consolidated operating margin 

as a percentage of total revenues our consolidated operating margin increased 03 percentage points in 2010 primarily as a result of lower cost of sales as a percentage of revenues in our domestic supply chain and companyowned store operations due primarily to increased volumes as discussed below offset in part by an increase in overall commodity prices including cheese and meats changes in the operating margin at our domestic companyowned store operations and our domestic supply chain operations are more fully described below 

domestic companyowned stores the domestic companyowned store operating margin increased 60 million or 98 in 2010 as summarized in the following table 

 

 the 60 million increase in the domestic companyowned store operating margin was due primarily to higher same store sales lower labor and related expenses and lower occupancy expenses offset in part by an increase in overall commodity prices including cheese and meats and the estimated 24 million positive impact in 2009 related to the inclusion of the 53 rd week as a percentage of store revenues the store operating margin increased 12 percentage points in 2010 as discussed in more detail below 

as a percentage of store revenues food costs increased 16 percentage points to 274 in 2010 due primarily to higher cheese and meat prices a slight increase in the product costs for our improved pizza and the negative impact of a lower average customer price paid per order during 2010 the cheese block price per pound averaged 150 in 2010 compared to 129 in 2009 

as a percentage of store revenues labor and related costs decreased 17 percentage points to 306 in 2010 due primarily to efficiencies obtained with higher same store sales and lower average labor rates in fiscal 2010 offset in part by the impact of a lower average customer price paid per order during 2010 

as a percentage of store revenues occupancy costs which include rent telephone utilities and depreciation decreased 13 percentage points to 109 in 2010 primarily resulting from leveraging these fixed expenses with the higher same store sales

liquidity and capital resources 

as of january 2 2011 we had working capital of 334 million excluding restricted cash and cash equivalents of 855 million and including total unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of 479 million historically we have operated with minimal positive working capital or negative working capital primarily because our receivable collection periods and inventory turn rates are faster than the normal payment terms on our current liabilities we generally collect our receivables within three weeks from the date of the related sale and we generally experience 30 to 40 inventory turns per year in addition our sales are not typically seasonal which further limits our working capital requirements these factors coupled with the use of our ongoing cash flows from operations to service our debt obligations invest in our business and repurchase our fixed rate notes and our common stock reduce our working capital amounts as of january 2 2011 the company had approximately 372 million of cash held for future interest payments 354 million of cash held in trust or as collateral for outstanding letters of credit primarily relating to our insurance programs and supply chain center leases 66 million of cash held in interest reserves 60 million of cash held for capitalization of certain subsidiaries and 03 million of other restricted cash for a total of 855 million of restricted cash and cash equivalents in 2010 the company released 62 million from restricted to unrestricted cash and cash equivalents as a result of a lower cash requirement for capitalization of certain subsidiaries and a lower requirement for cash held for interest reserves based on the terms of the related agreement 

as of january 2 2011 we had approximately 145 billion of total debt of which 08 million was classified as a current liability our primary source of liquidity is cash flows from operations during fiscal 2009 the company borrowed approximately 610 million under the variable funding note facility and repaid 34 million of those borrowings during fiscal 2010 the company borrowed an additional 24 million under its variable funding note facility and is now fully drawn on the 600 million facility our securitized debt requires interestonly payments until april 2012 this interestonly period can be extended for two oneyear periods if the company meets certain requirements in april 2012 and april 2013 based on our financial results for fiscal 2010 the company currently exceeds the required threshold for extension that will be evaluated in april 2012 and april 2013 management currently expects to have the option to take advantage of these interestonly periods at the extension assessment dates 

during 2010 the company used a combination of cash on hand and cash flows from operations to fund the repurchase and retirement of 1000 million in principal amount of its senior fixed rate notes and approximately 239 million of its subordinated fixed rate notes for a combined purchase price of approximately 1166 million including 05 million of accrued interest including the repurchases made in fiscal 2009 and 2010 the company has repurchased and retired a total of 3131 million of principal of its outstanding fixed rate notes for a total purchase price of approximately 2506 million including 16 million of accrued interest 

  

the company has a board of directors approved open market share repurchase program for up to 2000 million of the company’s common stock which has historically been funded by excess cash flows and borrowings available under the variable funding notes the company used cash of approximately 429 million and 54 million in 2008 and 2010 respectively for share repurchases under this program subsequent to fiscal 2010 the company used cash of approximately 39 million for share repurchases under this program and has approximately 935 million left under the 2000 million authorization the company did not repurchase any of its common shares in 2009 as it focused on reducing outstanding fixed rate notes the company expects to continue to use available unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and ongoing excess cash flow generation to among other things reduce its debt obligations and repurchase shares under the current authorized program 

during 2010 the company experienced significant growth in domestic same store sales versus the prior year which can be attributed to our innovative and effective advertising campaign for our improved pizza recipe continued focus on operational excellence and efforts to strengthen our franchisee base over the past several years all of which resulted in positive traffic in our domestic stores throughout fiscal 2010 the positive traffic in our stores also benefited our supply chain business as it experienced higher volumes year over year additionally our international business continued to perform well with positive same store sales and record net store growth in 2010 all of these factors have contributed to the company’s continued ability to generate positive operating cash flows further during 2009 and 2008 we continued to generate positive operating cash flows despite the economic downturn and challenges in our domestic operations we expect to use our unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and ongoing cash flows from operations to fund working capital requirements invest in our core business and reduce our longterm debt and repurchase our common stock we have historically funded our working capital requirements capital expenditures debt repayments and share repurchases primarily from our cash flows from operations and when necessary our available borrowings under the variable funding notes management believes its current unrestricted cash and cash equivalents balance and its expected ongoing cash flows from operations will be sufficient to fund operations for the foreseeable future 

we plan capital expenditures of approximately 200 million to 300 million in fiscal 2011 these capital expenditures primarily relate to investments in existing companyowned stores and supply chain centers as well as investments in our proprietary internally developed pointofsale system domino’s pulse™ and other technology initiatives all of which we feel are necessary to sustain and grow our business we did not have any material commitments for capital expenditures as of january 2 2011 

cash provided by operating activities was 1283 million in 2010 1013 million in 2009 and 753 million in 2008 the 270 million increase in 2010 versus 2009 was due primarily to a 346 million increase in net income excluding noncash adjustments this was offset in part by a 75 million net change in operating assets and liabilities due primarily to the timing of payments on current operating liabilities the 260 million increase in 2009 versus 2008 was due primarily to a 273 million net change in operating assets and liabilities due primarily to the timing of payments of current operating liabilities this was offset in part by a 12 million decrease in net income excluding noncash adjustments we are focused on continually improving our net income and cash flow from operations as noted above we generated 1283 million of cash from our operating activities even after deducting our 254 million of capital expenditures we generated a substantial amount of excess cash in 2010 some of which was deployed on other activities including investments in our business and technology initiatives repurchases of our fixed rate notes repurchases of our common stock or similar uses of cash management expects to continue to generate positive cash flows from operating activities for the foreseeable future 

cash used in investing activities was 184 million in 2010 and 329 million in 2009 cash provided by investing activities was 121 million in 2008 the 145 million decrease in 2010 versus 2009 was due primarily to a 179 million change in restricted cash and cash equivalents offset in part by a 26 million increase in capital expenditures the 450 million net change in 2009 versus 2008 was due primarily to a 251 million decrease in proceeds from the sale of assets primarily as a result of the sale of certain companyowned operations in 2008 and a 144 million change in restricted cash and cash equivalents 

cash used in financing activities was 1043 million in 2010 708 million in 2009 and 535 million in 2008 the 335 million increase in 2010 versus 2009 was due primarily to a 581 million decrease in proceeds from issuance of longterm debt offset in part by a 199 million decrease in repayments of longterm debt and capital lease obligations the 173 million increase in 2009 versus 2008 was due primarily to a 1184 million increase in repayments of longterm debt and capital lease obligations offset in part by a 580 million increase in the proceeds from issuance of longterm debt and a 430 million decrease in purchases of common stock 

  

based upon the current level of operations and anticipated growth we believe that the cash generated from operations and our current unrestricted cash and cash equivalents will be adequate to meet our anticipated debt service requirements capital expenditures and working capital needs for the foreseeable future our ability to continue to fund these items and continue to reduce debt could be adversely affected by the occurrence of any of the events described in item 1a risk factors there can be no assurance however that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operations or that future borrowings will be available under the variable funding notes or otherwise to enable us to service our indebtedness or to make anticipated capital expenditures our future operating performance and our ability to service extend or refinance the fixed rate notes and to service extend or refinance the variable funding notes will be subject to future economic conditions and to financial business and other factors many of which are beyond our control 

impact of inflation 

we believe that our results of operations are not materially impacted by moderate changes in the inflation rate inflation did not have a material impact on our operations in 2008 2009 or 2010 severe increases in inflation however could affect the global and us economies and could have an adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations further discussion on the impact of commodities and other cost pressures is included above as well as in item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

market risk

we are exposed to market risks from changes in commodity prices during the normal course of business we purchase cheese and certain other food products that are affected by changes in commodity prices and as a result we are subject to volatility in our food costs we may periodically enter into financial instruments to manage this risk we do not engage in speculative transactions nor do we hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes in instances when we use forward pricing agreements with our suppliers these agreements cover our physical commodity needs are not netsettled and are accounted for as normal purchases 

interest rate derivatives 

from time to time we have entered into interest rate swaps collars or similar instruments with the objective of managing volatility relating to our borrowing costs 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

we have exposure to various foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations for revenues generated by our operations outside the united states which can adversely impact our net income and cash flows total revenues of approximately 100 in 2008 105 in 2009 and 112 in 2010 were derived from sales to customers and royalties from franchisees outside the contiguous united states this business is conducted in the local currency but royalty payments are generally remitted to us in us dollars we do not enter into financial instruments to manage this foreign currency exchange risk a hypothetical 10 adverse change in the foreign currency rates in each of our top ten international markets based on store count would have resulted in a negative impact of approximately 67 million in 2010

our history 

we have been delivering quality affordable pizza to our customers since 1960 when brothers thomas and james monaghan borrowed 900 and purchased a small pizza store in ypsilanti michigan since that time our store count and geographic reach have grown substantially we opened our first franchise store in 1967 our first international store in 1983 and by 1998 we had expanded to over 6200 stores including more than 1700 international stores on six continents during 2005 we opened our 8000 th store worldwide and at january 3 2010 we had 8999 stores worldwide in more than 60 international markets we will celebrate the company’s 50 th anniversary in december 2010

industry overview 

in this document we rely on and refer to information regarding the us quick service restaurant or qsr sector the us qsr pizza category and its components and competitors including us from the crest ® report prepared by the npd group as well as market research reports analyst reports and other publiclyavailable information although we believe this information to be reliable we have not independently verified it domestic sales information relating to the qsr sector us qsr pizza category and us pizza delivery and carryout represent reported consumer spending obtained by the npd group’s crest report from consumer surveys this information relates to both our companyowned and franchise stores unless otherwise indicated all us industry data included in this document is based on reported consumer spending obtained by the npd group’s crest report from consumer surveys 

the us qsr pizza category is large and fragmented with sales of 335 billion in the twelve months ended november 2009 the us qsr pizza category is the second largest category within the 2301 billion us qsr sector the us qsr pizza category is primarily comprised of delivery dinein and carryout 

we operate primarily within us pizza delivery its 103 billion of sales accounted for approximately 31 of total us qsr pizza category sales in the twelve months ended november 2009 we and our top two competitors account for approximately 45 of us pizza delivery based on reported consumer spending with the remaining 55 attributable to regional chains and individual establishments 

we also compete in carryout which together with pizza delivery comprise the largest components of the us qsr pizza category us carryout pizza had 138 billion of sales in the twelve months ended november 2009 and while our primary focus is on pizza delivery we are also favorably positioned to compete in carryout given our strong brand convenient store locations and quality affordable menu offerings 

in contrast to the united states international pizza delivery is relatively underdeveloped with only domino’s and one other competitor having a significant global presence we believe that demand for international pizza delivery is large and growing driven by international consumers’ increasing emphasis on convenience 

our competitive strengths 

we believe that our competitive strengths include the following 

• strong and proven growth and earnings model over our 49year history we have developed a focused growth and earnings model this model is anchored by strong storelevel economics which provide an entrepreneurial incentive for our franchisees and generate demand for new stores our franchise system in turn has produced strong and consistent earnings for us through royalty payments and supply chain revenues with minimal associated capital expenditures by us 

  

• strong storelevel economics  we have developed a costefficient store model characterized by a delivery and carryout oriented store design with low capital requirements and a focused menu of quality affordable pizza and other complementary items at the store level we believe that the simplicity and efficiency of our operations give us significant advantages over our competitors who in many cases also focus on dinein our domestic stores and the majority of our international stores do not offer dinein areas and thus do not require expensive restaurant facilities and staffing in addition our focused menu of pizza and other complementary items simplifies and streamlines our production and delivery processes and maximizes economies of scale on purchases of our principal ingredients as a result of our focused business model and menu our stores are small averaging approximately 1000 to 1300 square feet and relatively inexpensive to build furnish and maintain as compared to many other qsr franchise opportunities the combination of this efficient store model and strong store sales volume has resulted in strong storelevel financial returns and makes domino’s pizza an attractive business opportunity for existing and prospective franchisees 

• strong and welldiversified franchise system  we have developed a large global diversified and committed franchise network that is a critical component of our systemwide success and our leading position in pizza delivery as of january 3 2010 our franchise store network consisted of 8533 stores 52 of which were located in the contiguous united states in the united states six franchisees operate more than 50 stores including our largest domestic franchisee who operates 143 stores our domestic franchisees own and operate an average of three to four stores we generally require our domestic franchisees to forego active outside business endeavors aligning their interests with ours and making the success of each domino’s pizza franchise of critical importance to our franchisees 

in addition we generally share 50 of the pretax profits generated by our regional dough manufacturing and supply chain centers with those domestic franchisees who agree to purchase all of their food from our supply chain system during 2009 we issued a record level of profit sharing payments to our franchisees in connection with this program these arrangements strengthen our ties with our franchisees by enhancing their profitability while providing us with a continuing source of revenues and earnings this arrangement also provides incentives for franchisees to work closely with us to reduce costs we believe our strong mutuallybeneficial franchisee relationships are evidenced by the over 99 voluntary participation in our domestic supply chain system our over 99 domestic franchise contract renewal rate and our over 99 collection rate on domestic franchise royalty and domestic supply chain receivables 

internationally we have been able to grow our franchise network by attracting franchisees with business experience and local market knowledge we generally employ our master franchise model which provides our international franchisees with exclusive rights to operate stores or subfranchise our wellrecognized domino’s pizza ® brand name in specific agreedupon market areas from yearend 2004 through 2009 we grew our international franchise network 48 from 2749 stores to 4072 stores our largest master franchisee operates 755 stores in five markets which accounts for approximately 19 of our total international store count during 2009 we had 414 gross international store openings including an 86store conversion in spain which represented the largest number of gross store openings in the international segment’s history 

• strong cash flow and earnings stream  a substantial percentage of our earnings are generated by our committed owneroperator franchisees through royalty payments and revenues to our verticallyintegrated supply chain system 

we believe that our store economics have led to a strong well diversified franchise system this established franchise system has produced strong cash flow and earnings for us which has enabled us to invest in the domino’s pizza ® brand our stores and our supply chain centers pay significant dividends repurchase shares of our common stock repurchase and retire outstanding principal on our fixed rate notes and deliver attractive returns to our stockholders 

• 1 pizza delivery company in the united states with a leading international presence  we are the number one pizza delivery company in the united states with an 184 share based on reported consumer spending with 4927 stores located in the contiguous united states our domestic store delivery areas cover a majority of us households our share position and scale allow us to leverage our purchasing power supply chain strength and advertising investment across our store base we also believe that our scale and market coverage allow us to effectively serve our customers’ demands for convenience and timely delivery 

  

outside the united states we have significant share positions in the key markets in which we compete including mexico the united kingdom australia south korea canada india japan france turkey and taiwan our top ten international markets based on store count accounted for approximately 79 of our international retail sales in 2009 we believe we have a leading presence in these markets 

• strong brand awareness we believe our domino’s pizza ® brand is one of the most widelyrecognized consumer brands in the world we believe consumers associate our brand with the timely delivery of quality affordable pizza and other complementary items over the past five years our domestic franchise and companyowned stores have invested an estimated 14 billion on national local and cooperative advertising in the united states our domino’s pizza ® brand is routinely named a megabrand by advertising age  we continue to reinforce our brand with extensive advertising through television radio print and webbased promotions we have also enhanced the strength of our brand through marketing affiliations with brands such as cocacola ®  

we believe that our brand is particularly strong among pizza consumers for whom a meal is a fairly spontaneous event in these situations we believe that service and product quality are the consumers’ priorities we believe that well established demographic and lifestyle trends will drive continuing emphasis on convenience and will therefore continue to play into our brand’s strength 

• internal dough manufacturing and supply chain system in addition to generating significant revenues and earnings we believe that our vertically integrated dough manufacturing and supply chain system enhances the quality and consistency of our products enhances our relationships with franchisees leverages economies of scale to offer lower costs to our stores and allows our store managers to better focus on store operations and customer service by relieving them of the responsibility of mixing dough in the stores 

in 2009 we made approximately 523000 fullservice food deliveries to our domestic stores or approximately two deliveries per store per week with an ontime delivery performance rate of approximately 92 all of our companyowned and over 99 of our domestic franchise stores purchase all of their food and supplies from us this is accomplished through our network of 16 regional dough manufacturing and supply chain centers each of which is generally located within a oneday delivery radius of the stores it serves and a leased fleet of over 400 tractors and trailers additionally we supply our domestic and international franchisees with equipment and supplies through our equipment and supply center which we operate as part of our domestic supply chain segment our equipment and supply center sells and delivers a full range of products including ovens and uniforms we also supply certain of our domestic stores with ingredients that are processed at our vegetable processing supply chain center and supply thin crust product that is manufactured at our thin crust manufacturing center both of which we operate as part of our domestic supply chain segment 

because we source the food for substantially all of our domestic stores our domestic supply chain segment enables us to leverage and monitor our strong supplier relationships to achieve the cost benefits of scale and to ensure compliance with our rigorous quality standards in addition the “onestop shop” nature of this system combined with our delivery accuracy allows our store managers to eliminate a significant component of the typical “backofstore” activity that many of our competitors’ store managers must undertake 

our business strategy 

we intend to achieve further growth and strengthen our competitive position through the continued implementation of our business strategy which includes the following key elements 

• continue to execute on our mission statement our mission statement is “exceptional franchisees and team members on a mission to be the best pizza delivery company in the world” we implement this mission statement by following a business strategy that

carryout had 138 billion of sales in the twelve months ended november 2009 while our primary focus is on pizza delivery we are also favorably positioned as a leader in carryout given our strong brand convenient store locations and quality affordable menu offerings 

• leverage our strong brand awareness we believe that the strength of our domino’s pizza ® brand makes us one of the first choices of consumers seeking a convenient quality and affordable meal we intend to continue to promote our brand name and enhance our reputation as the leader in pizza delivery in 2009 in connection with the launch of our inspired new pizza we launched the campaign “oh yes we did” the launch of this product and this campaign has received significant attention in the news media social networking internet sites and other media outlets we also created a new website wwwpizzaturnaroundcom to further communicate this message to our consumers highlight the improvements to our core pizza recipe and receive consumer feedback on the inspired new pizza 

in 2008 each of our domestic stores contributed 4 of their retail sales to our advertising fund for national advertising in addition to contributions for marketlevel advertising in 2009 our domestic stores within active cooperatives elected to allocate an additional 1 of their advertising contributions to support national advertising initiatives which resulted in each of our domestic stores contributing 5 of their retail sales for national advertising in 2009 also in 2009 domestic franchisees amended their master franchise agreements to require a contribution of 55 of their retail sales to fund national marketing and advertising campaigns and to eliminate the required marketlevel contributions beginning in 2010 

we intend to leverage our strong brand by continuing to introduce innovative consumertested and profitable new product varieties such as oven baked sandwiches domino’s american legends ® pizzas and breadbowl pasta™ complementary side items such as buffalo wings cheesy bread domino’s buffalo chicken kickers ®  cinna stix ® and chocolate lava crunch cakes and value promotions as well as through marketing affiliations with brands such as cocacola ®  additionally we may from timetotime partner with other organizations in an effort to promote the domino’s pizza ® brand we believe these opportunities when coupled with our scale and share leadership will allow us to grow our position in us pizza delivery 

• expand and optimize our domestic store base we plan to continue expanding our base of domestic stores to take advantage of the attractive growth opportunities in us pizza delivery we believe that our scale allows us to expand our store base with limited marketing distribution and other incremental infrastructure costs additionally our franchiseoriented business model allows us to expand our store base with limited capital expenditures and working capital requirements while we plan to expand our traditional domestic store base primarily through opening new franchise stores we will also continually evaluate our mix of companyowned and franchise stores and strategically acquire franchise stores and refranchise companyowned stores 

• continue to grow our international business we believe that pizza has global appeal and that there is strong and growing international demand for delivered pizza we have successfully built a broad international platform almost exclusively through our master franchise model as evidenced by our 4072 international stores in more than 60 international markets we believe that we continue to have significant longterm growth opportunities in international markets where we have established a leading presence in our top ten international markets we believe that our current store base is approximately half of the total longterm potential store base in those markets generally we believe we will achieve longterm growth internationally as a result of the favorable storelevel economics of our business model the growing international demand for delivered pizza and the strong global recognition of the domino’s pizza ® brand our international stores have produced positive quarterly same store sales growth for 64 consecutive quarters additionally during 2009 we had 414 gross international store openings including an 86store conversion in spain which represented the largest number of gross store openings in the international segment’s history 

  

store operations 

we believe that our focused and proven store model provides a significant competitive advantage relative to many of our competitors who focus on multiple components of the pizza category particularly dinein we have been focused primarily on pizza delivery for 49 years because our domestic stores and most of our international stores do not offer dinein areas they typically do not require expensive real estate are relatively small and are relatively inexpensive to build and equip our stores also benefit from lower maintenance costs as store assets have long lives and updates are not frequently required our simple and efficient operational processes which we have refined through continuous improvement include 

• strategic store locations to facilitate delivery service 

• productionoriented store designs 

• product and process innovations 

• a focused menu 

• efficient order taking production and delivery 

• domino’s pulse™ pointofsale system and 

• a comprehensive store audit program 

we believe these factors among other things contributed to domino’s pizza being voted 1 in customer satisfaction in a 2009 survey of consumers of the us largest limited service restaurants according to the annual american customer satisfaction index™ acsi 

strategic store locations to facilitate delivery service 

we locate our stores strategically to facilitate timely delivery service to our customers the majority of our domestic stores are located in populated areas in or adjacent to large or midsize cities or on or near college campuses we use geographic information software which incorporates variables such as traffic volumes competitor locations household demographics and visibility to evaluate and identify potential store locations and new markets 

productionoriented store designs 

our typical store is relatively small occupying approximately 1000 to 1300 square feet and is designed with a focus on efficient and timely production of consistently high quality pizza for delivery the store layout has been refined over time to provide an efficient flow from ordertaking to delivery our stores are primarily production facilities and accordingly do not typically have a dinein area 

product and process innovations 

our 49 years of experience and innovative culture have resulted in numerous new product and process developments that increase both quality and efficiency these include our efficient verticallyintegrated supply chain system a sturdier corrugated pizza box and a mesh screen that helped cook pizza crust more evenly the domino’s heatwave ® hot bag which was introduced in 1998 keeps our pizzas hot during delivery we also continue to introduce new products such as domino’s oven baked sandwiches launched in 2008 along with additional products launched in 2009 including domino’s american legends ® pizzas and domino’s breadbowl pasta™ additionally we have added a number of complementary side items to our menu such as buffalo wings domino’s buffalo chicken kickers ®  bread sticks cheesy bread cinna stix ® and chocolate lava crunch cakes which were introduced in 2009 in the fourth quarter of 2009 we introduced our inspired new pizza which was a change to our core pizza recipe

we maintain a focused menu that is designed to present an attractive quality offering to customers while minimizing order errors and expediting the order taking and food preparation processes our basic menu has three choices for pizza products pizza type pizza size and pizza toppings most of our stores carry two or three sizes of traditional handtossed pan brooklyn style and crunchy thin crust pizza our typical store also offers domino’s american legends ® pizzas domino’s oven baked sandwiches domino’s bread bowl pasta™ buffalo wings domino’s buffalo chicken kickers ®  bread sticks cheesy bread cinna stix ®  chocolate lava crunch cakes and cocacola ® soft drink products we also occasionally offer other products on a promotional or a regional basis such as salads we believe that our focused menu creates a strong identity among consumers improves operating efficiency and maintains food quality and consistency 

  

efficient order taking production and delivery 

each store executes an operational process that includes order taking pizza preparation cooking via automated conveyordriven ovens boxing and delivery the entire order taking and pizza production process is designed for completion in approximately 1215 minutes these operational processes are supplemented by an extensive employee training program designed to ensure worldclass quality and customer service it is our priority to ensure that every domino’s store operates in an efficient consistent manner while maintaining our high standards of food quality and team member safety 

domino’s pulse™ pointofsale system 

our computerized management information systems are designed to improve operating efficiencies provide corporate management with timely access to financial and marketing data and reduce store and corporate administrative time and expense we have installed domino’s pulse™ our proprietary pointofsale system in every companyowned store in the united states and in substantially all of our domestic franchise stores some enhanced features of domino’s pulse™ over our previous pointofsale system include 

• touch screen ordering which improves accuracy and facilitates more efficient order taking 

• a delivery driver routing system which improves delivery efficiency 

• improved administrative and reporting capabilities which enable store managers to better focus on store operations and customer satisfaction and 

• enhanced online ordering capability including pizza tracker which was introduced in 2007 and pizza builder which was introduced in 2008 

since the rollout of domino’s pulse™ to our domestic stores we have been growing our online ordering transactions and currently on average 20 of our domestic stores’ sales originate through our online ordering platform recent industry data indicates that we have the largest share of online sales in the us qsr pizza category additionally we estimate that the domino’s pizza system is one of the largest online retailers in the us in terms of the number of transactions we intend to continue to enhance and grow our online ordering capabilities 

we require our domestic franchisees to install and maintain domino’s pulse™ additionally domino’s pulse™ has been installed in over 1400 international franchise stores 

comprehensive store audit program 

we utilize a comprehensive store audit program to ensure that our stores are meeting both our stringent standards as well as the expectations of our customers the audit program focuses primarily on the quality of the pizza the store is producing the customer service the store is providing and the condition of the store as viewed by the customer we believe that this store audit program is an integral part of our strategy to maintain high standards in our stores 

segment overview 

we operate in three business segments 

• domestic stores our domestic stores segment consists of our domestic franchise operations which oversee our network of 4461 franchise stores located in the contiguous united states and our domestic companyowned store operations which operate our network of 466 companyowned stores located in the contiguous united states 

• domestic supply chain our domestic supply chain segment operates 16 regional dough manufacturing and food supply chain centers one thin crust manufacturing center one supply chain center providing equipment and supplies to certain of our domestic and international stores and one vegetable processing supply chain center and 

• international our international segment oversees our network of 4072 international franchise stores in more than 60 international markets our international segment also distributes food to a limited number of markets from six dough manufacturing and supply chain centers in alaska hawaii and canada four 

  

domestic stores 

during 2009 our domestic stores segment accounted for 4936 million or 35 of our consolidated revenues our domestic franchises are operated by entrepreneurs who own and operate an average of three to four stores six of our domestic franchisees operate more than 50 stores including our largest domestic franchisee who operates 143 stores our principal sources of revenues from domestic store operations are companyowned store sales and royalty payments based on retail sales by our franchisees our domestic network of companyowned stores also plays an important strategic role in our predominantly franchised operating structure in addition to generating revenues and earnings we use our domestic companyowned stores as test sites for new products and promotions as well as store operational improvements and as forums for training new store managers and prospective franchisees we also believe that our domestic companyowned stores add to the economies of scale available for advertising marketing and other costs that are primarily borne by our franchisees while we continue to be primarily a franchised business we continually evaluate our mix of domestic companyowned and franchise stores in an effort to optimize our longterm profitability 

our domestic companyowned store operations are divided into eleven geographic areas located throughout the contiguous united states while our domestic franchise operations are divided into four regions our team members within these areas provide direct supervision over our domestic companyowned stores provide training store operational audits and marketing services and provide financial analysis and store development services to our franchisees we maintain a close relationship with our franchise stores through regional franchise teams an array of computerbased training materials that help franchise stores comply with our standards and franchise advisory groups that facilitate communications between us and our franchisees 

domestic supply chain 

during 2009 our domestic supply chain segment accounted for 7637 million or 54 of our consolidated revenues our domestic supply chain segment is comprised primarily of 16 regional dough manufacturing and supply chain centers that manufacture fresh dough on a daily basis and purchase receive store and deliver quality pizzarelated food products and other complementary items to all of our companyowned stores and over 99 of our domestic franchise stores each regional dough manufacturing and supply chain center serves approximately 300 stores generally located within a oneday delivery radius we regularly supply nearly 5000 stores with various supplies and ingredients of which nine product groups account for over 90 of the volume our domestic supply chain segment made approximately 523000 fullservice deliveries in 2009 or approximately two deliveries per store per week and we produced over 264 million pounds of dough during 2009 

we believe that our franchisees voluntarily choose to obtain food supplies and equipment from us because we provide the most efficient convenient and costeffective alternative while also providing both quality and consistency in addition our domestic supply chain segment offers a profitsharing arrangement to stores that purchase all of their food from our domestic dough manufacturing and supply chain centers this profitsharing arrangement generally provides domestic companyowned stores and participating franchisees with 50 of their regional supply chain center’s pretax profits profits are shared with the franchisees based upon each franchisee’s purchases from our supply chain centers during 2009 we issued a record level of profit sharing payments to our franchisees in connection with this program we believe these arrangements strengthen our ties with these franchisees 

the information systems used by our domestic dough manufacturing and supply chain centers are an integral part of the quality service we provide our stores we use routing strategies and software to optimize our daily delivery schedules which maximizes ontime deliveries through our strategic dough manufacturing and supply chain center locations and proven routing systems we achieved an ontime delivery performance rate of approximately 92 during 2009 our supply chain center drivers unload food and supplies and stock store shelves typically during nonpeak store hours which minimize disruptions in store operations 

international 

during 2009 our international segment accounted for 1468 million or 11 of our consolidated revenues we have 589 franchise stores in mexico 562 franchise stores in the united kingdom 411 franchise stores in australia 329 franchise stores in south korea 319 franchise stores in canada 296 franchise stores in india and over 100 franchise stores in each of japan france turkey and taiwan the principal sources of revenues from our international operations are royalty payments generated by retail sales from franchise stores and sales of food and supplies to franchisees in certain markets 

  

we have grown by more than 1300 international stores over the past five years during 2009 we had 414 gross international store openings including an 86store conversion in spain which represented the largest number of gross store openings in the international segment’s history we empower our managers and franchisees to adapt the standard operating model within certain parameters to satisfy the local eating habits and consumer preferences of various regions outside the contiguous united states currently most of our international stores are operated under master franchise agreements and we plan to continue entering into master franchise agreements with qualified franchisees to expand our international operations in selected countries we believe that our international franchise stores appeal to potential franchisees because of our wellrecognized brand name the limited capital expenditures required to open and operate our stores and our system’s favorable store economics the following table shows our store count as of january 3 2010 in our top ten international markets which account for 76 of our international stores 

 

 our franchise program 

as of january 3 2010 our 4461 domestic franchise stores were owned and operated by our 1161 domestic franchisees the success of our franchise formula which enables franchisees to benefit from our brand name with a relatively low initial capital investment has attracted a large number of motivated entrepreneurs as franchisees as of january 3 2010 the average domestic franchisee owned and operated three to four stores and had been in our franchise system for twelve years at the same time six of our domestic franchisees operated more than 50 stores including our largest domestic franchisee who operates 143 stores 

domestic franchisees 

we apply rigorous standards to prospective franchisees we generally require prospective domestic franchisees to manage a store for at least one year before being granted a franchise this enables us to observe the operational and financial performance of a potential franchisee prior to entering into a longterm contract we also generally restrict the ability of domestic franchisees to become involved in other businesses which focuses our franchisees’ attention on operating their stores as a result the vast majority of our franchisees come from within the domino’s pizza system we believe these standards are largely unique to the franchise industry and result in qualified and focused franchisees operating their stores 

franchise agreements 

we enter into franchise agreements with domestic franchisees under which the franchisee is granted the right to operate a store in a particular location for a term of ten years with options to renew for an additional term of ten years we currently have a franchise contract renewal rate of over 99 under the current standard franchise agreement we assign an exclusive area of primary responsibility to each franchise store during the term of the franchise agreement the franchisee is required to pay a 55 royalty fee on sales subject in limited instances to lower rates based on area development agreements sales initiatives and new store incentives we have the contractual right subject to state law to terminate a franchise agreement for a variety of reasons including but not limited to a franchisee’s failure to make required payments when due or failure to adhere to specified company policies and standards 

franchise store development 

we provide domestic franchisees with assistance in selecting store sites and conforming the space to the physical specifications required for a domino’s pizza store each domestic franchisee selects the location and design for each store subject to our approval based on accessibility and visibility of the site and demographic factors including population density and anticipated traffic levels we provide design plans and sell fixtures and equipment to most of our franchise stores 

  

franchise training and support 

training store managers and employees is a critical component of our success we require all domestic franchisees to complete initial and ongoing training programs provided by us in addition under the standard domestic franchise agreement domestic franchisees are required to implement training programs for their store employees we assist our domestic and international franchisees by making training materials available to them for their use in training store managers and employees including computerbased training materials comprehensive operations manuals and franchise development classes we also maintain communications with our franchisees online through various newsletters and through facetoface meetings 

franchise operations 

we enforce stringent standards over franchise operations to protect the domino’s pizza ® brand all franchisees are required to operate their stores in compliance with written policies standards and specifications which include matters such as menu items ingredients materials supplies services furnishings decor and signs each franchisee has significant discretion to determine the prices to be charged to customers we also provide ongoing support to our franchisees including training marketing assistance and consultation to franchisees who experience financial or operational difficulties we have established several advisory boards through which franchisees contribute to developing systemwide initiatives 

international franchisees 

the vast majority of our markets outside of the contiguous united states are operated by master franchisees with franchise and distribution rights for entire regions or countries in select regions or countries we franchise directly to individual store operators our master franchise agreements generally grant the franchisee exclusive rights to develop or subfranchise stores and the right to operate supply chain centers in a particular geographic area for a term of ten to twenty years with options to renew for additional terms the agreements typically contain growth clauses requiring franchisees to open a minimum number of stores within a specified period prospective master franchisees are required to possess or have access to local market knowledge required to establish and develop domino’s pizza stores the local market knowledge focuses on the ability to identify and access targeted real estate sites along with expertise in local customs culture consumer behavior and laws we also seek candidates that have access to sufficient capital to meet their growth and development plans the master franchisee is generally required to pay an initial onetime franchise fee as well as an additional franchise fee upon the opening of each new store in addition the master franchisee is required to pay a continuing royalty fee as a percentage of retail sales which varies among international markets 

marketing operations 

in our recent history depending on the fiscal year our domestic stores have contributed 4 or 5 of their retail sales to fund national marketing and advertising campaigns with additional required contributions to marketlevel programs however during 2009 all domestic franchisees amended their master franchise agreements to require a contribution of 55 of their retail sales to fund national marketing and advertising campaigns and to eliminate the required marketlevel contributions beginning in 2010 in those markets where we have cooperative advertising programs our domestic stores are still able to contribute to marketlevel media campaigns at their discretion these national and marketlevel funds are administered by domino’s national advertising fund inc or dnaf our notforprofit advertising subsidiary the funds remitted to dnaf are used primarily to purchase media for advertising but also support market research field communications public relations commercial production talent payments and other activities supporting the domino’s pizza ® brand dnaf also provides costeffective print materials to our domestic stores for use in local marketing that reinforce our national branding strategy in addition to the national and marketlevel advertising contributions domestic stores spend additional amounts on local store marketing including targeted database mailings saturation print mailings and community involvement through school and civic organizations additionally we may from timetotime partner with other organizations in an effort to promote the domino’s pizza ® brand 

by communicating a common brand message at the national local market and store levels we create and reinforce a powerful consistent marketing message to consumers this is evidenced by our previous marketing campaigns with the slogans “get the door it’s domino’s ® ” and “you got 30 minutes™” as well as our current marketing campaign with the slogan “oh yes we did” over the past five years we estimate that domestic stores have invested approximately 14 billion on national local and cooperative advertising 

internationally marketing efforts are primarily the responsibility of the franchisee in each local market we assist international franchisees with their marketing efforts through marketing workshops and sharing of best practices and successful concepts 

  

thirdparty suppliers 

we have maintained active relationships of 15 years or more with more than half of our major suppliers our suppliers are required to meet strict quality standards to ensure food safety we review and evaluate our suppliers’ quality assurance programs through among other actions onsite visits third party audits and product evaluations to ensure compliance with our standards we believe that the length and quality of our relationships with suppliers provides us with priority service and quality products at competitive prices 

we believe that two factors have been critical to maintaining longlasting relationships and keeping our purchasing costs low first we are one of the largest domestic volume purchasers of pizzarelated products such as flour cheese sauce and pizza boxes which allows us to maximize leverage with our suppliers when items are put out for bid on a scheduled basis second we use a combination of singlesource and multisource procurement strategies each supply category is evaluated along a number of criteria including value of purchasing leverage consistency of quality and reliability of supply to determine the appropriate number of suppliers 

we currently purchase our pizza cheese from a single supplier in 2007 the company entered into a new arrangement with this supplier under this arrangement the supplier agreed to provide an uninterrupted supply of cheese and the company agreed to a fiveyear pricing period during which it agreed to purchase all of its primary pizza cheese for the company’s domestic stores from this supplier or alternatively pay to the supplier an amount reflecting any benefit previously received by the company under the new pricing terms the pricing schedule is directly correlated to the cme block cheddar price the majority of our meat toppings come from a single supplier under a contract that began in july 2008 and expires in july 2010 we have the right to terminate these arrangements for quality failures and for uncured breaches 

we believe that alternative suppliers for all of these ingredients are available and all of our pizza boxes sauces and other ingredients are sourced from various suppliers while we may incur additional costs if we are required to replace any of our suppliers we do not believe that such additional costs would have a material adverse effect on our business we also entered into a multiyear agreement with cocacola effective january 1 2003 for the contiguous united states the contract provides for cocacola to be our exclusive beverage supplier and expires at such time as a minimum number of cases of cocacola ® products are purchased by us we continually evaluate each supply category to determine the optimal sourcing strategy 

we have not experienced any significant shortages of supplies or any delays in receiving our food or beverage inventories restaurant supplies or products the current economic environment has created additional financial pressures for some of our suppliers however we do not currently anticipate disruptions in our supplies prices charged to us by our suppliers are subject to fluctuation and we have historically been able to pass increased costs and savings on to our stores we may periodically enter into financial instruments to manage the risk from changes in commodity prices we do not engage in speculative transactions nor do we hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes 

competition 

us and international pizza delivery and carryout are highly competitive domestically we compete against regional and local companies as well as national chains pizza hut ® and papa john’s ®  internationally we compete primarily against pizza hut ® and regional and local companies we generally compete on the basis of product quality location image service and price we also compete on a broader scale with quick service and other international national regional and local restaurants in addition the overall food service industry and the qsr sector in particular are intensely competitive with respect to product quality price service convenience and concept the industry is often affected by changes in consumer tastes economic conditions demographic trends and consumers’ disposable income we compete within the food service industry and the qsr sector not only for customers but also for personnel suitable real estate sites and qualified franchisees 

government regulation 

we are subject to various federal state and local laws affecting the operation of our business as are our franchisees including various health sanitation fire and safety standards each store is subject to licensing and regulation by a number of governmental authorities which include zoning health safety sanitation building and fire agencies in the jurisdiction in which the store is located in connection with maintaining our stores we may be required to expend funds to meet certain federal state and local regulations including regulations requiring that remodeled or altered stores be accessible to persons with disabilities difficulties in obtaining or the failure to obtain required licenses or approvals could delay or prevent the opening of a new store in a particular area or cause an existing store to cease operations our supply chain facilities are also licensed and subject to similar regulations by federal state and local health and fire codes 

  

we are also subject to the fair labor standards act and various other federal and state laws governing such matters as minimum wage requirements overtime and other working conditions and citizenship requirements a significant number of our food service personnel are paid at rates related to the applicable minimum wage and past increases in the minimum wage have increased our labor costs as would future increases 

we are subject to the rules and regulations of the federal trade commission and various state laws regulating the offer and sale of franchises the federal trade commission and various state laws require that we furnish a franchise disclosure document containing certain information to prospective franchisees and a number of states require registration of the franchise disclosure document with state authorities we are operating under exemptions from registration in several states based on the net worth of our operating subsidiary domino’s pizza llc and experience substantive state laws that regulate the franchisorfranchisee relationship presently exist in a substantial number of states and bills have been introduced in congress from time to time that would provide for federal regulation of the franchisorfranchisee relationship the state laws often limit among other things the duration and scope of noncompetition provisions the ability of a franchisor to terminate or refuse to renew a franchise and the ability of a franchisor to designate sources of supply we believe that our franchise disclosure document together with any applicable state versions or supplements and franchising procedures comply in all material respects with both the federal trade commission guidelines and all applicable state laws regulating franchising in those states in which we have offered franchises 

internationally our franchise stores are subject to national and local laws and regulations that often are similar to those affecting our domestic stores including laws and regulations concerning franchises labor health sanitation and safety our international stores are also often subject to tariffs and regulations on imported commodities and equipment and laws regulating foreign investment we believe that our international disclosure statements franchise offering documents and franchising procedures comply in all material respects with the laws of the foreign countries in which we have offered franchises 

trademarks 

we have many registered trademarks and service marks and believe that the domino’s ® mark and domino’s pizza ® names and logos in particular have significant value and are important to our business our policy is to pursue registration of our trademarks and to vigorously oppose the infringement of any of our trademarks we license the use of our registered marks to franchisees through franchise agreements 

environmental matters 

we are not aware of any federal state or local environmental laws or regulations that will materially affect our earnings or competitive position or result in material capital expenditures however we cannot predict the effect of possible future environmental legislation or regulations during 2009 there were no material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities and no such material expenditures are anticipated in 2010 

employees 

as of january 3 2010 we had approximately 10200 employees who we refer to as team members in our companyowned stores supply chain centers world resource center our corporate headquarters and regional offices as franchisees are independent business owners they and their employees are not included in our employee count we consider our relationship with our employees and franchisees to be good we estimate the total number of people who work in the domino’s pizza system including our employees franchisees and the employees of franchisees was over 180000 as of january 3 2010 

none of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement 

safety 

our commitment to safety is embodied in our hiring training and review process before an applicant is considered for hire as a delivery driver in the united states motor vehicle records are reviewed to ensure a minimum safe driving record of one or two years in addition we require regular checks of driving records and proof of insurance for delivery drivers throughout their employment with us each domestic domino’s driver including drivers employed by franchisees are required to complete our safe delivery training program we have also implemented several safe driving incentive programs 

our safety and security department oversees security matters for our domestic companyowned stores regional security and safety directors oversee security measures at domestic companyowned store locations and assist local authorities in investigations of incidents involving our stores or personnel 

  

community activities 

we believe in supporting the communities we serve and we base our corporate giving on three simple elements delivering charitable support to our own team members to our customers and to national programs 

national philanthropic partner 

we have a tradition of creating multiyear partnerships with a national charity to raise funds and public awareness for the organization our current national philanthropic partner is st jude children’s research hospital st jude is internationally recognized for its pioneering work in finding cures and saving children with cancer and other catastrophic diseases through a variety of internal and consumerbased activities including a national fundraising campaign called thanks and giving the domino’s pizza system has contributed more than 65 million to st jude during our six years of partnership including 20 million in 2009 in addition to raising funds the domino’s pizza system has supported st jude through inkind donations including hosting hospitalwide pizza parties for patients and their families the domino’s pizza system also helps st jude build awareness through the inclusion of the st jude logo on millions of our pizza boxes and through a link on our consumer web site 

the domino’s pizza partners foundation

domino’s pizza contributions 

over the last four years the domino’s pizza system has directly contributed as well as helped raise approximately 90 million to external charitable organizations in monetary and inkind giving 

franchisee involvement 

in addition to the work that we do in the community on a corporate level we are proud to have the support of more than 2000 franchisees around the world who choose to get involved with local charities to make a difference in their communities franchisees participate in numerous local programs with schools hospitals and other charitable organizations delivering pizzas and offering monetary support franchisees also support specific initiatives such as the delivering the dough fundraising card program launched in 2004 this program assists notforprofit organizations in raising funds and generated an estimated 44 million for notforprofits in its first year alone 

research and development 

we operate research and product development facilities at our world resource center in ann arbor michigan companysponsored research and development activities which include among other things testing new products for possible menu additions are an important activity to us and our franchisees we do not consider the amounts spent on research and development to be material

 item 1a risk factors 

risks relating to our business and industry 

the pizza category is highly competitive and such competition could adversely affect our operating results 

we compete in the united states against two national chains as well as many regional and local businesses we could experience increased competition from existing or new companies in the pizza category which could create increasing pressures to grow our business in order to maintain our market share if we are unable to maintain our competitive position we could experience downward pressure on prices lower demand for our products reduced margins the inability to take advantage of new business opportunities and the loss of market share all of which would have an adverse effect on our operating results and could cause our stock price to decline 

we also compete on a broader scale with quick service and other international national regional and local restaurants the overall food service market and the quick service restaurant sector are intensely competitive with respect to food quality price service image convenience and concept and are often affected by changes in 

• consumer tastes 

• national regional or local economic conditions 

• disposable purchasing power 

• demographic trends and 

• currency fluctuations related to our international operations 

  

we compete within the food service market and the quick service restaurant sector not only for customers but also for management and hourly employees suitable real estate sites and qualified franchisees our domestic supply chain segment is also subject to competition from outside suppliers if other suppliers who meet our qualification standards were to offer lower prices or better service to our franchisees for their ingredients and supplies and as a result our franchisees chose not to purchase from our domestic supply chain centers our financial condition business and results of operations would be adversely affected 

if we fail to successfully implement our growth strategy which includes opening new domestic and international stores our ability to increase our revenues and operating profits could be adversely affected 

a significant component of our growth strategy includes the opening of new domestic and international stores we and our franchisees face many challenges in opening new stores including among others 

• availability of financing with acceptable terms 

• selection and availability of suitable store locations 

• negotiation of acceptable lease or financing terms 

• securing required domestic or foreign governmental permits and approvals 

• employment and training of qualified personnel and 

• general economic and business conditions 

the opening of additional franchise stores also depends in part upon the availability of prospective franchisees who meet our criteria our failure to add a significant number of new stores would adversely affect our ability to increase revenues and operating income 

we are currently planning to expand our international operations in many of the markets where we currently operate and in selected new markets this may require considerable management time as well as startup expenses for market development before any significant revenues and earnings are generated operations in new foreign markets may achieve low margins or may be unprofitable and expansion in existing markets may be affected by local economic and market conditions therefore as we expand internationally we or our franchisees may not experience the operating margins we expect our results of operations may be negatively impacted and our common stock price may decline 

we may also pursue strategic acquisitions as part of our business if we are able to identify acquisition candidates such acquisitions may be financed to the extent permitted under our debt agreements with substantial debt or with potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities 

the food service market is affected by consumer preferences and perceptions changes in these preferences and perceptions may lessen the demand for our products which would reduce sales and harm our business 

food service businesses are affected by changes in consumer tastes national regional and local economic conditions and demographic trends for instance if prevailing health or dietary preferences cause consumers to avoid pizza and other products we offer in favor of foods that are perceived as more healthy our business and operating results would be harmed also if demand for our recently introduced inspired new pizza does not resonate with consumers our business and operating results could be harmed moreover because we are primarily dependent on a single product if consumer demand for pizza should decrease our business would suffer more than if we had a more diversified menu as many other food service businesses do 

increases in food labor and other costs could adversely affect our profitability and operating results 

an increase in our operating costs could adversely affect our profitability factors such as inflation increased food costs increased labor and employee benefit costs and increased energy costs may adversely affect our operating costs most of the factors affecting costs are beyond our control and in many cases we may not be able to pass along these increased costs to our customers or franchisees most ingredients used in our pizza particularly cheese are subject to significant price fluctuations as a result of seasonality weather demand and other factors the cheese block price per pound averaged 129 in 2009 and the estimated increase in companyowned store food costs from a hypothetical 025 adverse change in the average cheese block price per pound would have been approximately 21 million in 2009 labor costs are largely a function of the minimum wage for a majority of our store personnel and certain supply chain center personnel and generally are also a function of the availability of labor food including cheese costs and labor represent approximately 50 to 60 of a typical companyowned store’s sales 

  

our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our business and limit our ability to plan for or respond to changes in our business 

as a result of the 2007 recapitalization we hold a substantial amount of indebtedness and are highly leveraged as of january 3 2010 our consolidated longterm indebtedness was approximately 157 billion we may also incur additional debt which would not be prohibited under the terms of the securitized debt our substantial indebtedness could have important consequences to our business and our shareholders for example it could 

• make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our debt agreements 

• increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions 

• require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow for other purposes and 

• limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and the industry in which we operate thereby placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that may have less debt 

in addition the financial and other covenants we agreed to with our lenders may limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness make investments pay dividends and engage in other transactions and the leverage may cause potential lenders to be less willing to loan funds to us in the future our failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default that if not cured or waived could result in the acceleration of repayment of all of our indebtedness 

we may be unable to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our significant debt service obligations which would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

our ability to make principal and interest payments on and to refinance our indebtedness will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future this to a certain extent is subject to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control if our business does not generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the amounts projected or at all or if future borrowings are not available to us under our variable funding notes in amounts sufficient to fund our other liquidity needs our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected if we cannot generate sufficient cash flow from operations to make scheduled principal and interest payments on our debt obligations in the future we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity sell assets delay capital expenditures or seek additional equity if we are unable to refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all or to effect any other action relating to our indebtedness on satisfactory terms or at all our business may be harmed 

the terms of our securitized debt financing of certain of our whollyowned subsidiaries have restrictive terms and our failure to comply with any of these terms could put us in default which would have an adverse effect on our business and prospects 

unless and until we repay all outstanding borrowings under our securitized debt we will remain subject to the restrictive terms of these borrowings the securitized debt under which certain of our whollyowned subsidiaries issued and guaranteed senior and subordinated fixed rate notes and variable funding senior revolving notes contain a number of covenants with the most significant financial covenant being a debt service coverage calculation these covenants limit the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to among other things 

• sell assets 

• alter the business we conduct 

• engage in mergers acquisitions and other business combinations 

• declare dividends or redeem or repurchase capital stock 

• incur assume or permit to exist additional indebtedness or guarantees 

• make loans and investments 

• incur liens and 

• enter into transactions with affiliates 

the securitized debt also requires us to maintain a specified financial ratio at the end of each fiscal quarter these restrictions could affect our ability to pay dividends or repurchase shares of our common stock our ability to meet this financial ratio can be affected by events beyond our control and we may not satisfy such a test a breach of this covenant could result in a rapid amortization event or default under the securitized debt if amounts owed under the securitized debt are accelerated because of a default under the securitized debt and we are unable to pay such amounts the insurers have the right to assume control of substantially all of the securitized assets 

  

in the event that one or both of the insurance companies that provide financial guaranties of our fixed and variable funding note payments were to become the subject of insolvency or similar proceedings our lenders would not be required to fund our variable funding notes additionally under the terms of our indenture governing our notes an event of default would occur if i one or both of the insurance companies were to become the subject of insolvency or similar proceedings and ii the related insurance policies were not continued or sold to a third party who would assume one or both of the insurance companies’ obligations under the related policies but instead were terminated or canceled as a result of those proceedings in an event of default all unpaid amounts under the fixed and variable rate notes could become immediately due and payable at the direction or consent of holders of a majority of the outstanding fixed rate notes or the remaining insurance company that is not the subject of insolvency or similar proceedings such acceleration of our debt could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity if we were unable to negotiate mutually acceptable terms with our lenders or if alternate funding were not available to us 

we expect that during the first five years following issuance the senior notes will accrue interest at a fixed rate of 5261 per year and the subordinated notes will accrue interest at a fixed rate of 7629 if we are not able to exercise either of our two oneyear extension options following the fiveyear interestonly period our securitized debt will be subject to principal amortization and may also be subject to an increased interest rate if it is not repaid or refinanced if we do exercise one or both extensions then we may be subject to an increased interest rate 

if we are unable to refinance or repay amounts under the securitized debt prior to the expiration of the fiveyear interestonly term six or sevenyear interestonly term if we satisfy certain conditions and exercise one or both of our oneyear extension elections our cash flow would be directed to the repayment of the securitized debt and other than a weekly servicing fee sufficient to cover minimal selling general and administrative expenses would not be available for operating our business 

no assurance can be given that any refinancing or additional financing will be possible when needed or that we will be able to negotiate acceptable terms in addition our access to capital is affected by prevailing conditions in the financial and capital markets and other factors beyond our control there can be no assurance that market conditions will be favorable at the times that we require new or additional financing 

the indenture governing the securitized debt will restrict the cash flow from the entities subject to the securitization to any of our other entities and upon the occurrence of certain events cash flow would be further restricted 

in the event that a rapid amortization event occurs under the indenture including without limitation upon an event of default under the indenture or the failure to repay the securitized debt at the end of the five year interestonly period or at the end of any extension period the funds available to us would be reduced or eliminated which would in turn reduce our ability to operate or grow our business 

we do not have longterm contracts with certain of our suppliers and as a result they could seek to significantly increase prices or fail to deliver 

we do not have written contracts or formal longterm arrangements with certain of our suppliers although in the past we have not experienced significant problems with our suppliers our suppliers may implement significant price increases or may not meet our requirements in a timely fashion if at all the occurrence of any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

shortages or interruptions in the supply or delivery of fresh food products could adversely affect our operating results 

we and our franchisees are dependent on frequent deliveries of fresh food products that meet our specifications shortages or interruptions in the supply of fresh food products caused by unanticipated demand problems in production or distribution financial or other difficulties of suppliers inclement weather or other conditions could adversely affect the availability quality and cost of ingredients which would adversely affect our operating results 

any prolonged disruption in the operations of any of our dough manufacturing and supply chain centers could harm our business 

we operate 16 regional dough manufacturing and supply chain centers one thin crust manufacturing center and one vegetable processing supply chain center in the contiguous united states and a total of six dough manufacturing and supply chain centers in alaska hawaii and canada our domestic dough manufacturing and supply chain centers service all of our companyowned stores and over 99 of our domestic franchise stores as a result any prolonged disruption in the operations of any of these facilities whether due to technical or labor difficulties destruction or damage to the facility real estate issues or other reasons could adversely affect our business and operating results 

  

we face risks of litigation and negative publicity from customers franchisees employees and others in the ordinary course of business which diverts our financial and management resources any adverse litigation or publicity may negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations 

claims of illness or injury relating to food quality or food handling are common in the food service industry in addition class action lawsuits have been filed and may continue to be filed against various quick service restaurants alleging among other things that quick service restaurants have failed to disclose the health risks associated with highfat foods and that quick service restaurant marketing practices have encouraged obesity in addition to decreasing our sales and profitability and diverting our management resources adverse publicity or a substantial judgment against us could negatively impact our financial condition results of operations and brand reputation thereby hindering our ability to attract and retain franchisees and grow our business 

further we may be subject to employee franchisee and other claims in the future based on among other things discrimination harassment wrongful termination and wage rest break and meal break issues and those claims relating to overtime compensation we have been subject to these types of claims in the past and in 2007 settled a purported class action claim of this type in california relating to rest break and meal break compensation if one or more of these claims were to be successful or if there is a significant increase in the number of these claims or if we receive significant negative publicity our business financial condition and operating results could be harmed 

loss of key personnel or our inability to attract and retain new qualified personnel could hurt our business and inhibit our ability to operate and grow successfully 

our success in the highly competitive business of pizza delivery will continue to depend to a significant extent on our leadership team and other key management personnel other than with our president and chief executive officer elect j patrick doyle who was named to this position in february 2010 we do not have longterm employment agreements with any of our executive officers as a result we may not be able to retain our executive officers and key personnel or attract additional qualified management our success also will continue to depend on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel to operate our stores dough manufacturing and supply chain centers and international operations the loss of these employees or our inability to recruit and retain qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 

our international operations subject us to additional risk such risks and costs may differ in each country in which we do business and may cause our profitability to decline due to increased costs 

we conduct a growing portion of our business outside the united states our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected if global markets in which our franchise stores compete are affected by changes in political economic or other factors these factors over which neither we nor our franchisees have control may include 

• recessionary or expansive trends in international markets 

• changing labor conditions and difficulties in staffing and managing our foreign operations 

• increases in the taxes we pay and other changes in applicable tax laws 

• legal and regulatory changes and the burdens and costs of our compliance with a variety of foreign laws 

• changes in inflation rates 

• changes in exchange rates and the imposition of restrictions on currency conversion or the transfer of funds 

• difficulty in collecting our royalties and longer payment cycles 

• expropriation of private enterprises 

• political and economic instability and 

• other external factors 

fluctuations in the value of the us dollar in relation to other currencies may lead to lower revenues and earnings 

exchange rate fluctuations could have an adverse effect on our results of operations approximately 87 of our total revenues in 2007 100 of our total revenues in 2008 and 105 of our total revenues in 2009 were derived from our international segment a majority of which were denominated in foreign currencies sales made by our stores outside the united states are denominated in the currency of the country in which the store is located and this currency could become less valuable prior to conversion to us dollars as a result of exchange rate fluctuations unfavorable currency fluctuations could lead to increased prices to customers outside the united states or lower profitability to our franchisees outside the united states or could result in lower revenues for us on a us dollar basis from such customers and franchisees 

  

we may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property which could harm the value of our brand and branded products and adversely affect our business 

we depend in large part on our brand and branded products and believe that they are very important to our business we rely on a combination of trademarks copyrights service marks trade secrets and similar intellectual property rights to protect our brand and branded products the success of our business depends on our continued ability to use our existing trademarks and service marks in order to increase brand awareness and further develop our branded products in both domestic and international markets we have registered certain trademarks and have other trademark registrations pending in the united states and foreign jurisdictions not all of the trademarks that we currently use have been registered in all of the countries in which we do business and they may never be registered in all of these countries we may not be able to adequately protect our trademarks and our use of these trademarks may result in liability for trademark infringement trademark dilution or unfair competition all of the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property in the united states and in foreign countries may not be adequate in addition the laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states further through acquisitions of third parties we may acquire brands and related trademarks that are subject to the same risks as the brands and trademarks we currently own 

we may from time to time be required to institute litigation to enforce our trademarks or other intellectual property rights or to protect our trade secrets such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could negatively affect our sales profitability and prospects regardless of whether we are able to successfully enforce our rights 

our earnings and business growth strategy depends on the success of our franchisees and we may be harmed by actions taken by our franchisees or employees of our franchisees that are outside of our control 

a significant portion of our earnings comes from royalties generated by our franchise stores franchisees are independent operators and their employees are not our employees we provide limited training and support to franchisees but the quality of franchise store operations may be diminished by any number of factors beyond our control consequently franchisees may not successfully operate stores in a manner consistent with our standards and requirements or may not hire and train qualified managers and other store personnel if they do not our image and reputation may suffer and as a result our revenues and stock price could decline while we try to ensure that our franchisees maintain the quality of our brand and branded products our franchisees may take actions that adversely affect the value of our intellectual property or reputation as of january 3 2010 we had 1161 domestic franchisees operating 4461 domestic stores six of these franchisees each operate over 50 domestic stores including our largest domestic franchisee who operates 143 stores and the average franchisee owns and operates three to four stores in addition our international master franchisees are generally responsible for the development of significantly more stores than our domestic franchisees as a result our international operations are more closely tied to the success of a smaller number of franchisees than our domestic operations our largest international master franchisee operates 755 stores in five markets which accounts for approximately 19 of our total international store count our domestic and international franchisees may not operate their franchises successfully if one or more of our key franchisees were to become insolvent or otherwise were unable or unwilling to pay us our royalties or other amounts owed our business and results of operations would be adversely affected 

interruption failure or compromise of our information technology communications systems and electronic data could hurt our ability to effectively serve our customers and protect customer data which could damage our reputation and adversely affect our business and operating results 

an increasingly significant portion of our retail sales depends on the continuing operation of our information technology and communications systems including but not limited to domino’s pulse™ our online ordering platform and our credit card processing systems our information technology communication systems and electronic data may be vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes terrorist attacks floods fires power loss telecommunications failures computer viruses loss of data unauthorized data breaches or other attempts to harm our systems additionally we operate data centers that are also subject to breakins sabotage and intentional acts of vandalism that could cause disruptions in our ability to serve our customers and protect customer data some of our systems are not fully redundant and our disaster recovery planning cannot account for all eventualities the occurrence of a natural disaster intentional sabotage or other unanticipated problems could result in lengthy interruptions in our service any errors or vulnerabilities in our systems or damage to or failure of our systems could result in interruptions in our services and noncompliance with certain regulations which could reduce our revenues and profits and damage our business and brand

we have retention programs for workers’ compensation general liability and owned and nonowned automobile liabilities we are generally responsible for up to 10 million per occurrence under these retention programs for workers’ compensation and general liability we are also generally responsible for between 500000 and 30 million per occurrence under these retention programs for owned and nonowned automobile liabilities total insurance limits under these retention programs vary depending upon the period covered and range up to 1100 million per occurrence for general liability and owned and nonowned automobile liabilities and up to the applicable statutory limits for workers’ compensation these insurance policies may not be adequate to protect us from liabilities that we incur in our business in addition in the future our insurance premiums may increase and we may not be able to obtain similar levels of insurance on reasonable terms or at all any such inadequacy of or inability to obtain insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations we are not required to and do not specifically set aside funds for our retention programs

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

overview 

our fiscal year typically includes 52 weeks comprised of three twelve week quarters and one sixteen week quarter every five or six years our fiscal year includes an extra or 53 rd  week in the fourth quarter fiscal 2009 consisted of 53 weeks while fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2008 consisted of 52 weeks 

description of the business 

we are the number one pizza delivery company in the united states with an 184 share of the pizza delivery market based on reported consumer spending we also have a leading international presence we operate through a network of 466 companyowned stores all of which are in the united states and 8533 franchise stores located in all 50 states and in more than 60 international markets in addition we operate 16 regional dough manufacturing and supply chain centers in the contiguous united states as well as six dough manufacturing and supply chain centers outside the contiguous united states in 2009 we converted one of our dough manufacturing and supply chain centers in the united states to a thin crust manufacturing center this facility supplies the majority of thin crust product for our domestic stores 

our financial results are driven largely by retail sales at our companyowned and franchise stores changes in retail sales are driven by changes in same store sales and store counts we monitor both of these metrics very closely as they directly impact our revenues and profits and strive to consistently increase both same store sales and our store counts retail sales drive companyowned store revenues royalty payments from franchisees and supply chain revenues retail sales are primarily impacted by the strength of the domino’s pizza ® brand the results of our marketing promotions our ability to execute our store operating model the overall global economic environment and other business strategies 

we devote significant attention to our brandbuilding efforts which is evident in our system’s estimated 14 billion of domestic advertising spending over the past five years and our frequent designation as a megabrand by advertising age  we plan on continuing to build our brand and retail sales by satisfying customers worldwide with our pizza delivery offerings and by continuing to invest significant amounts in the advertising and marketing of the domino’s pizza ® brand 

we also pay particular attention to the store economics or the investment performance of a store to its owner of both our companyowned and franchise stores we believe that our system’s favorable store economics benefit from the relatively small initial and ongoing investments required to own and operate a domino’s pizza store we believe these favorable investment requirements coupled with a strong brand message supported by significant advertising spending as well as highquality and focused menu offerings drive strong store economics which in turn drive demand for new stores 

business performance 

at the start of 2009 we faced a tough economic environment and challenges in our domestic business we focused on several areas in 2009 including menu diversification and improving domestic store operations during 2009 we continued to exit underperforming franchisees from the system which allowed us to strengthen our overall system of stores we made targeted investments in new training and audit programs which we believe have resulted in better store operations we have also made significant changes to our marketing strategies in recent years focusing on driving sustained traffic growth including launching new product platforms in 2008 we introduced our domino’s oven baked sandwiches which not only drove traffic growth but also expanded our lunch business in 2009 we introduced domino’s american legends ® pizzas domino’s breadbowl pasta™ and chocolate lava crunch cakes which further increased traffic and the impact of all of these strategies resulted in increased traffic in all four fiscal quarters in 2009 in addition domino’s pizza was voted 1 in customer satisfaction in a 2009 survey of consumers of the us largest limited service restaurants according to the annual american customer satisfaction index™ acsi further in the fourth quarter of 2009 we launched our inspired new pizza which resulted in significant improvements to our core pizza product since the launch of our inspired new pizza we have received significant media attention and have experienced significant increases in traffic and sales in our stores it is unknown if this trend will continue once we are past this initial trial period however we believe momentum is building as we enter fiscal 2010 our 50 th year of operation in addition to the aforementioned efforts other initiatives such as increases in media spending and further investments in our technology platforms are important strategies that will contribute to the growth and success of our business in 2010 and beyond 

  

in 2009 global retail sales which are total retail sales at companyowned and franchise stores worldwide increased 22 as compared to 2008 retail sales for franchise stores are reported to the company by its franchisees and are not included in company revenues this increase in global retail sales was driven primarily by the inclusion of the 53 rd week in 2009 which positively impacted global retail sales by 25 percentage points in 2009 additionally global retail sales benefited from strong international same store sales growth same store sales growth in our domestic franchise stores and growth in worldwide store counts these increases were offset in part by the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates on our international sales in 2008 global retail sales increased 14 as compared to 2007 this increase in global retail sales was driven by strong international same store sales growth as well as growth in worldwide store counts offset in part by a decrease in domestic same store sales and the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates on our international sales 

revenues decreased 210 million or 15 in 2009 and decreased 378 million or 26 in 2008 the decrease in revenues in 2009 was largely due to lower companyowned store revenues resulting primarily from the impact of the store divestitures in 2008 lower domestic supply chain revenues due primarily to lower food prices including cheese and the negative impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on our international revenues these decreases were offset in part by the inclusion of the 53 rd week in 2009 which positively impacted revenues by approximately 344 million the decline in 2008 was due primarily to lower companyowned store and domestic franchise revenues driven primarily by companyowned store divestitures lower same store sales and lower volumes in our domestic supply chain operations worldwide store counts have increased from 8366 at the beginning of 2007 to 8999 at the end of 2009 this growth in store counts can be attributed to the growing global acceptance of our brand and our pizza delivery concept as well as the economics inherent in our system which attracts new franchisees and encourages existing franchisees to grow their business domestic same store sales decreased 17 in 2007 decreased 49 in 2008 and increased 05 in 2009 international same store sales increased 67 62 and 43 during the same periods the company’s domestic same store sales results in 2007 and 2008 reflected the underperformance of our product and promotional offerings during those years continued challenges in our domestic business and a weak consumer environment domestic same store sales in fiscal 2009 reflected the success of several initiatives including the launch of two new product platforms domino’s breadbowl pasta™ and domino’s american legends ® pizzas as well as the introduction of domino’s chocolate lava crunch cakes and the introduction of our inspired new pizza during the fourth quarter of 2009 internationally same stores sales growth continues to result from the growing acceptance of delivered pizza around the globe and the successful execution of the concept 

income from operations decreased 28 from 1950 million in 2008 to 1895 million in 2009 and increased 06 in 2008 income from operations in 2009 was negatively impacted by approximately 49 million of expenses incurred in connection with the stock option exchange program as well as the incremental expense and acceleration of expense for the retirement provision added to existing stock option agreements furthermore 2009 was negatively impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates affecting our international operations and higher variable bonuses related to the company’s bonus program these decreases in 2009 were offset in part by the inclusion of the 53 rd week in 2009 which benefited income from operations by approximately 67 million by higher margins in our companyowned stores and domestic supply chain business as well as domestic and international same store sales growth and store count growth in our international markets the growth in income from operations in 2008 was primarily the result of the 142 million of gains on the sale of companyowned stores and continued strong performance in our international business additionally the comparison benefited from lower income from operations in 2007 when we incurred higher expenses associated with the company’s recapitalization and a 50 million reserve recorded in 2007 related to certain legal matters in california these increases in 2008 were offset in part by lower margins in our companyowned store and domestic supply chain businesses a decrease in domestic franchise same store sales and approximately 14 million of separation and other costs recorded related primarily to the company’s reductioninforce 

net income increased 478 from 540 million in 2008 to 797 million in 2009 and increased 425 in 2008 the increase in net income in 2009 was due primarily to 563 million of pretax gains recorded on the extinguishment of debt combined with lower interest expense in 2009 as a result of lower debt levels additionally the inclusion of the 53 rd week benefited net income in 2009 by approximately 29 million these increases were partially offset by the aforementioned decrease in income from operations the increase in net income in 2008 was primarily due to the comparison to lower net income amounts in 2007 when we incurred higher expenses associated with the company’s recapitalization and the aforementioned increase in income from operations in 2008 these recapitalization expenses in 2007 included the writeoff of deferred financing fees and bond discount related to the extinguishment of debt and a 133 million premium paid to repurchase and retire thenoutstanding notes these increases were offset in part by higher ongoing interest expense in 2008 associated with increased debt under our new capital structure and higher interest income earned in 2007 on funds received in connection with the company’s recapitalization 

  

we are highly leveraged primarily as a result of our recapitalization in 2007 as of january 3 2010 consolidated debt was 157 billion since 1998 a large portion of our cash flows provided from operations has been used to make principal and interest payments on our indebtedness as well as distributions to shareholders in the form of dividends and stock repurchases our securitized debt requires interestonly payments until april 2012 this interestonly period can be extended for two oneyear periods if the company meets certain requirements in april 2012 and april 2013 based on fiscal 2009 financial results the company has exceeded the required threshold for extension management currently intends to take advantage of this interestonly period of payments for the full seven years to the extent such extension periods remain available to the company overall we believe that our ability to consistently produce significant free cash flows allows us the flexibility not only to service our significant debt but also to invest in our growing business as well as return cash to our shareholders 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america the preparation of these financial statements requires our management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis our management evaluates its estimates including those related to revenue recognition allowance for uncollectible receivables longlived and intangible assets insurance and legal matters and income taxes we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from those estimates changes in our accounting policies and estimates could materially impact our results of operations and financial condition for any particular period we believe that our most critical accounting policies and estimates are 

revenue recognition  we earn revenues through our network of domestic companyowned and franchise stores dough manufacturing and supply chain centers and international operations retail sales from companyowned stores and royalty revenues resulting from the retail sales from franchise stores are recognized as revenues when the items are delivered to or carried out by customers retail sales are generally reported and related royalties paid to the company on a weekly basis based on a percentage of retail sales as specified in the related standard franchise agreement generally 55 of domestic franchise retail sales in the event that retail sales are not reported timely by a franchisee the company will record royalty revenues in the period earned based on an estimate of the franchisee’s sales however these estimates are not significant and have historically been materially consistent with the actual amounts revenues from companyowned stores and royalty revenues from franchise stores fluctuate from timetotime as a result of store count changes for example if a companyowned store that generated 500000 in revenue in fiscal 2008 is sold to a franchisee in fiscal 2009 revenues from companyowned stores would have declined by 500000 in fiscal 2009 while franchise royalty revenues would have increased by only 27500 in fiscal 2009 as we generally collect 55 of a domestic franchisee’s retail sales sales of food from our supply chain centers are recognized as revenues upon delivery of the food to franchisees while sales of equipment and supplies are generally recognized as revenues upon shipment of the related products to franchisees 

allowance for uncollectible receivables we closely monitor our accounts and notes receivable balances and provide allowances for uncollectible amounts as a result of our reviews these estimates are based on among other factors historical collection experience and a review of our receivables by aging category additionally we may also provide allowances for uncollectible receivables based on specific customer collection issues that we have identified while writeoffs of bad debts have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established management cannot guarantee that future writeoffs will not exceed historical rates specifically if the financial condition of our franchisees were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments additional allowances may be required 

at january 3 2010 our total allowance for uncollectible accounts receivables was approximately 92 million compared to 109 million as of december 28 2008 representing approximately 108 and 136 of our consolidated gross accounts receivable in those years a 10 change in our allowance for uncollectible accounts receivables at january 3 2010 would result in a change in reserves of approximately 09 million and a change in income before provision for income taxes by the same amount currently management does not believe that there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions that were used to calculate our allowance for uncollectible accounts receivables 

  

longlived and intangible assets we record longlived assets including property plant and equipment and capitalized software at cost for acquisitions of franchise operations we estimate the fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired based on physical inspection of assets historical experience and other information available to us regarding the acquisition we depreciate and amortize longlived assets using useful lives determined by us based on historical experience and other information available to us we evaluate the potential impairment of longlived assets based on various analyses including the projection of undiscounted cash flows whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable for companyowned stores we perform related impairment tests on an operating market basis which the company has determined to be the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of other cash flows if the carrying amount of a longlived asset exceeds the amount of the expected future undiscounted cash flows of that asset or the estimated fair value of the asset an impairment loss is recognized and the asset is written down to its estimated fair value 

we have not made any significant changes in the methodology used to estimate the future market cash flows of companyowned stores during the years presented same store sales fluctuations and the rates at which operating costs will fluctuate in the future are key factors in evaluating recoverability of the related assets if our same store sales significantly decline or if operating costs increase and we are unable to recover these costs the carrying value of our companyowned stores by market may be unrecoverable and we may be required to recognize an impairment charge at january 3 2010 we determined that our longlived assets were not impaired 

a significant portion of our goodwill relates to acquisitions of domestic franchise stores and is included in our domestic stores segment specifically the companyowned stores reporting unit we evaluate goodwill annually for impairment by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit which is primarily determined using historical undiscounted cash flows multiplied by a market multiple which is estimated based on the results of recent store sales transactions to its carrying value if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value goodwill would be impaired we have not made any significant changes in the methodology used to evaluate goodwill impairment during the years presented at january 3 2010 the fair value of our business operations with associated goodwill exceeded their recorded carrying value including the related goodwill if cash flows generated by our companyowned stores were to decline significantly in the future or there were negative revisions to the market multiple assumption we may be required to recognize a goodwill impairment charge however based on the latest impairment analysis we do not believe it is reasonably likely that there could be changes in assumptions that would trigger impairment 

insurance and legal matters we are a party to lawsuits and legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business management closely monitors these legal matters and estimates the probable costs for the resolution of such matters these estimates are primarily determined by consulting with both internal and external parties handling the matters and are based upon an analysis of potential results assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies while historically our actual losses have been materially consistent with our reserves legal judgments can be volatile and difficult to predict accordingly if our estimates relating to legal matters proved inaccurate for any reason we may be required to increase or decrease the related expense in future periods we had accruals for legal matters of approximately 29 million at december 28 2008 and approximately 45 million at january 3 2010 

for certain periods prior to december 1998 and for periods after december 2001 we maintain insurance coverage for workers’ compensation general liability and owned and nonowned auto liability under insurance policies requiring payment of a deductible for each occurrence up to between 500000 and 30 million depending on the policy year and line of coverage the related insurance reserves are based on undiscounted independent actuarial estimates which are based on historical information along with assumptions about future events specifically various methods including analyses of historical trends and actuarial valuation methods are utilized to estimate the cost to settle reported claims and claims incurred but not yet reported the actuarial valuation methods develop estimates of the future ultimate claim costs based on the claims incurred as of the balance sheet date when estimating these liabilities several factors are considered including the severity duration and frequency of claims legal cost associated with claims healthcare trends and projected inflation over the past several years we have experienced improvements in frequency of claims however increasing severity of claims and medical costs have partially offset these trends our methodology for determining our exposure has remained consistent throughout the years presented management believes that the various assumptions developed and actuarial methods used to determine our self insurance reserves are reasonable and provide meaningful data that management uses to make its best estimate of our exposure to these risks while historically our actual losses have been materially consistent with our reserves changes in assumptions for such factors as medical costs and legal actions as well as changes in actual experience could cause our estimates to change in the near term which could result in an increase or decrease in the related expense in future periods a 10 change in our self insurance liability at january 3 2010 would have affected our income before provision for income taxes by approximately 27 million for fiscal 2009 we had accruals for insurance matters of approximately 304 million at december 28 2008 and 272 million at january 3 2010 

  

income taxes we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities and reserves for uncertain tax positions we measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using current enacted tax rates that will apply in the years in which we expect the temporary differences to be recovered or paid judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes and related reserves deferred tax assets and liabilities these include establishing a valuation allowance related to the ability to realize certain deferred tax assets if necessary as of january 3 2010 we had no valuation allowances recorded for deferred tax assets our accounting for deferred tax assets represents our best estimate of future events our net deferred tax assets assume that we will generate sufficient taxable income in specific tax jurisdictions based on our estimates and assumptions changes in our current estimates due to unanticipated events could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operation 

the amounts relating to taxes recorded on the balance sheet including tax reserves also consider the ultimate resolution of revenue agent reviews based on estimates and assumptions we believe we have adequately accounted for our uncertain tax positions however tax audits changes in tax laws and other unforeseen matters may result in us owing additional taxes we adjust our reserves for uncertain tax positions when facts and circumstances change or due to the passage of time for example the completion of a tax audit or the expiration of a statute of limitations or changes in penalty and interest reserves associated with uncertain tax positions management believes that our tax positions comply with applicable tax law and that we have adequately provided for these matters however to the extent the final tax outcome of these matters is different than our recorded amounts we may be required to adjust our tax reserves resulting in additional income tax expense or benefit in future periods

liquidity and capital resources 

as of january 3 2010 we had negative working capital of 319 million excluding restricted cash and cash equivalents of 911 million and including total unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of 424 million historically we have operated with minimal positive working capital or negative working capital primarily because our receivable collection periods and inventory turn rates are faster than the normal payment terms on our current liabilities we generally collect our receivables within three weeks from the date of the related sale and we generally experience 40 to 50 inventory turns per year in addition our sales are not typically seasonal which further limits our working capital requirements these factors coupled with significant and ongoing cash flows from operations which have been primarily used to service our debt obligations invest in our business and repurchase common stock reduce our working capital amounts as of january 3 2010 the company had approximately 370 million of cash held for future interest payments 349 million of cash held as collateral for outstanding letters of credit 100 million cash held for capitalization of certain subsidiaries 88 million cash held in interest reserves and 04 million of other restricted cash for a total of 911 million of restricted cash

as a result of and concurrent with the execution of the lc agreement the company terminated substantially all of its preexisting letters of credit which provided additional borrowing availability under its variable funding notes during fiscal 2009 the company borrowed approximately 610 million under the variable funding notes and repaid 34 million of those borrowings subsequent to january 3 2010 the company terminated its last preexisting letter of credit under the variable funding notes facility which provided an additional 24 million of borrowing availability under its variable funding notes as a result subsequent to fiscal 2009 the company borrowed an additional 24 million under the variable funding notes and currently has no borrowing capacity available under the 600 million variable funding notes facility

our history 

we have been delivering quality affordable pizza to our customers since 1960 when brothers thomas and james monaghan borrowed 900 and purchased a small pizza store in ypsilanti michigan since that time our store count and geographic reach have grown substantially we opened our first franchise store in 1967 our first international store in 1983 and by 1998 we had expanded to over 6200 stores including more than 1700 international stores on six continents during 2005 we opened our 8000 th store worldwide at december 28 2008 we had 8773 stores worldwide in more than 60 countries 

in 1998 an investor group led by investment funds associated with bain capital llc completed a recapitalization through which the investor group acquired a 93 controlling economic interest in our company from thomas monaghan and his family at the time of the recapitalization mr monaghan retired and in march 1999 david a brandon was named our chairman and chief executive officer in 2004 domino’s pizza inc completed its initial public offering the “ipo” and now trades on the new york stock exchange under the ticker symbol “dpz” 

our company was founded in 1960 tism inc a michigan corporation and our predecessor operated through its whollyowned subsidiary domino’s pizza llc a michigan limited liability company in connection with the ipo tism inc reincorporated in delaware under the name domino’s pizza inc 

industry overview 

in this document we rely on and refer to information regarding the us quick service restaurant or qsr sector the us qsr pizza category and its components and competitors including us from the crest report prepared by the npd group as well as market research reports analyst reports and other publiclyavailable information although we believe this information to be reliable we have not independently verified it domestic sales information relating to the qsr sector us qsr pizza category and us pizza delivery and carryout represent reported consumer spending obtained by the npd group’s crest report from consumer surveys this information relates to both our companyowned and franchise stores unless otherwise indicated all us industry data included in this document is based on reported consumer spending obtained by the npd group’s crest report from consumer surveys 

the us qsr pizza category is large and fragmented with sales of 339 billion in the twelve months ended november 2008 the us qsr pizza category is the second largest category within the 2303 billion us qsr sector the us qsr pizza category is primarily comprised of delivery dinein and carryout 

we operate primarily within us pizza delivery its 109 billion of sales accounted for 32 of total us qsr pizza category sales in the twelve months ended november 2008 we and our top two competitors account for approximately 47 of us pizza delivery based on reported consumer spending with the remaining 53 attributable to regional chains and individual establishments 

we also compete in carryout which together with pizza delivery are the largest components of the us qsr pizza category us carryout pizza had 138 billion of sales in the twelve months ended november 2008 and while our primary focus is on pizza delivery we are also favorably positioned to compete in carryout given our strong brand convenient store locations and quality affordable menu offerings 

in contrast to the united states international pizza delivery is relatively underdeveloped with only domino’s and one other competitor having a significant global presence we believe that demand for international pizza delivery is large and growing driven by international consumers’ increasing emphasis on convenience 

our competitive strengths 

we believe that our competitive strengths include the following 

• strong and proven growth and earnings model over our 48year history we have developed a focused growth and earnings model this model is anchored by strong storelevel economics which provide an entrepreneurial incentive for our franchisees and generate demand for new stores our franchise system in turn has produced strong and consistent earnings for us through royalty payments and supply chain revenues with minimal associated capital expenditures by us 

• strong storelevel economics  we have developed a costefficient store model characterized by a delivery and carryout oriented store design with low capital requirements and a focused menu of quality affordable pizza and complementary side items at the store level we believe that the simplicity and efficiency of our operations give us significant advantages over our competitors who in many cases also focus on dinein 

  

our domestic stores and the majority of our international stores do not offer dinein areas and thus do not require expensive restaurant facilities and staffing in addition our focused menu of pizza and complementary side items simplifies and streamlines our production and delivery processes and maximizes economies of scale on purchases of our principal ingredients as a result of our focused business model and menu our stores are small averaging approximately 1000 to 1300 square feet and inexpensive to build furnish and maintain as compared to many other qsr franchise opportunities the combination of this efficient store model and strong store sales volume has resulted in strong storelevel financial returns and makes domino’s pizza an attractive business opportunity for existing and prospective franchisees 

• strong and welldiversified franchise system  we have developed a large global diversified and committed franchise network that is a critical component of our systemwide success and our leading position in pizza delivery as of december 28 2008 our franchise store network consisted of 8284 stores 55 of which were located in the contiguous united states in the united states only six franchisees operate more than 50 stores including our largest domestic franchisee which operates 144 stores our domestic franchisees on average operate between three and four stores we generally require our domestic franchisees to forego active outside business endeavors aligning their interests with ours and making the success of each domino’s pizza franchise of critical importance to our franchisees 

in addition we generally share 50 of the pretax profits generated by our regional dough manufacturing and supply chain centers with those domestic franchisees who agree to purchase all of their food from our supply chain system these arrangements strengthen our ties with our franchisees by enhancing their profitability while providing us with a continuing source of revenues and earnings this arrangement also provides incentives for franchisees to work closely with us to reduce costs we believe our strong mutuallybeneficial franchisee relationships are evidenced by the over 99 voluntary participation in our domestic supply chain system our over 99 domestic franchise contract renewal rate and our over 99 collection rate on domestic franchise royalty and domestic supply chain receivables 

internationally we have also been able to grow our franchise network by attracting franchisees with business experience and local market knowledge we generally use our master franchise model which provides our international franchisees with exclusive rights to operate stores or subfranchise our wellrecognized domino’s pizza ® brand name in specific agreedupon market areas from yearend 2003 through 2008 we grew our international franchise network 48 from 2523 stores to 3726 stores our largest master franchisee operates 729 stores in five markets which accounts for approximately 20 of our total international store count 

• strong cash flow and earnings stream  a substantial percentage of our earnings are generated by our committed owneroperator franchisees through royalty payments and revenues to our verticallyintegrated supply chain system 

we believe that our store economics have led to a strong well diversified franchise system this established franchise system has produced strong cash flow and earnings for us enabling us to invest in the domino’s pizza ® brand and our stores pay significant dividends repurchase shares of our common stock and deliver attractive returns to our stockholders 

• 1 pizza delivery company in the united states with a leading international presence  we are the number one pizza delivery company in the united states with a 175 share based on reported consumer spending with 5047 stores located in the contiguous united states our domestic store delivery areas cover a majority of us households our share position and scale allow us to leverage our purchasing power supply chain strength and advertising investment across our store base we also believe that our scale and market coverage allow us to effectively serve our customers’ demands for convenience and timely delivery 

outside the united states we have significant share positions in the key markets in which we compete including among other countries mexico where we are the largest qsr company in terms of store count in any qsr category the united kingdom australia south korea canada india japan france and taiwan our top ten international markets based on store count accounted for approximately 80 of our international retail sales in 2008 we believe we have a leading presence in these markets 

• strong brand awareness we believe our domino’s pizza ® brand is one of the most widelyrecognized consumer brands in the world we believe consumers associate our brand with the timely delivery of quality affordable pizza and complementary side items over the past five years our domestic franchise and companyowned stores have invested an estimated 14 billion on national local and cooperative advertising in the united states our domino’s pizza ® brand has been routinely named a megabrand by advertising age  we continue to reinforce our brand with extensive advertising through television radio print and webbased promotions we have also enhanced the strength of our brand through marketing affiliations with brands such as cocacola ®  

  

we believe that our brand is particularly strong among pizza consumers for whom a meal is a fairly spontaneous event in these situations we believe that service and product quality are the consumers’ priorities we believe that well established demographic and lifestyle trends will drive continuing emphasis on convenience and will therefore continue to play into our brand’s strength 

• internal dough manufacturing and supply chain system in addition to generating significant revenues and earnings we believe that our vertically integrated dough manufacturing and supply chain system enhances the quality and consistency of our products enhances our relationships with franchisees leverages economies of scale to offer lower costs to our stores and allows our store managers to better focus on store operations and customer service by relieving them of the responsibility of mixing dough in the stores 

in 2008 we made approximately 575000 fullservice food deliveries to our domestic stores or between two and three deliveries per store per week with a delivery accuracy rate of approximately 99 all of our companyowned and over 99 of our domestic franchise stores purchase all of their food and supplies from us this is accomplished through our network of 17 regional dough manufacturing and supply chain centers each of which is generally located within a oneday delivery radius of the stores it serves and a leased fleet of over 400 tractors and trailers additionally we supply our domestic and international franchisees with equipment and supplies through our equipment and supply center which we operate as part of our domestic supply chain segment our equipment and supply center sells and delivers a full range of products including ovens and uniforms we also supply certain of our domestic stores with ingredients that are processed at our vegetable processing supply chain center which we operate as part of our domestic supply chain segment 

because we source the food for substantially all of our domestic stores our domestic supply chain segment enables us to leverage and monitor our strong supplier relationships to achieve the cost benefits of scale and to ensure compliance with our rigorous quality standards in addition the “onestop shop” nature of this system combined with our delivery accuracy allows our store managers to eliminate a significant component of the typical “backofstore” activity that many of our competitors’ store managers must undertake 

our business strategy 

we intend to achieve further growth and strengthen our competitive position through the continued implementation of our business strategy which includes the following key elements 

• continue to execute on our mission statement our mission statement is “exceptional franchisees and team members on a mission to be the best pizza delivery company in the world” we implement this mission statement by following a business strategy that

carryout had 138 billion of sales in the twelve months ended november 2008 while our primary focus is on pizza delivery we are also favorably positioned as a leader in carryout given our strong brand convenient store locations and quality affordable menu offerings 

  

• leverage our strong brand awareness we believe that the strength of our domino’s pizza ® brand makes us one of the first choices of consumers seeking a convenient quality and affordable meal we intend to continue to promote our brand name and enhance our reputation as the leader in pizza delivery in 2007 we launched the campaign “you got 30 minutes™” which built on the company’s 30minute delivery heritage 

in 2007 and 2008 each of our domestic stores contributed 4 of their retail sales to our advertising fund for national advertising in addition to contributions for marketlevel advertising additionally for 2007 our domestic stores within active cooperatives elected to allocate an additional 1 of their advertising contributions to support national advertising initiatives 

we intend to leverage our strong brand by continuing to introduce innovative consumertested and profitable new product varieties such as domino’s brooklyn style pizza and domino’s oven baked sandwiches complementary side items such as buffalo wings cheesy bread domino’s buffalo chicken kickers ® and cinna stix ®  and value promotions as well as through marketing affiliations with brands such as cocacola ®  additionally we may from timetotime partner with other organizations in an effort to promote the domino’s pizza ® brand we believe these opportunities when coupled with our scale and share leadership will allow us to grow our position in us pizza delivery

• continue to grow our international business we believe that pizza has global appeal and that there is strong and growing international demand for delivered pizza we have successfully built a broad international platform almost exclusively through our master franchise model as evidenced by our 3726 international stores in more than 60 countries we believe that we continue to have significant longterm growth opportunities in international markets where we have established a leading presence in our current top ten international markets we believe that our store base in total for these ten markets is approximately half of the total longterm potential store base in those markets generally we believe we will achieve longterm growth internationally as a result of the favorable storelevel economics of our business model the growing international demand for delivered pizza and the strong global recognition of the domino’s pizza ® brand our international stores have produced positive quarterly same store sales growth for 60 consecutive quarters 

store operations 

we believe that our focused and proven store model provides a significant competitive advantage relative to many of our competitors who focus on multiple components of the pizza category particularly dinein we have been focused on pizza delivery for 48 years because our domestic stores and most of our international stores do not offer dinein areas they typically do not require expensive real estate are relatively small and are relatively inexpensive to build and equip our stores also benefit from lower maintenance costs as store assets have long lives and updates are not frequently required our simple and efficient operational processes which we have refined through continuous improvement include 

• strategic store locations to facilitate delivery service 

• productionoriented store designs 

• product and process innovations 

• a focused menu 

• efficient order taking production and delivery 

• domino’s pulse™ pointofsale system and 

• a comprehensive store audit program 

strategic store locations to facilitate delivery service 

we locate our stores strategically to facilitate timely delivery service to our customers the majority of our domestic stores are located in populated areas in or adjacent to large or midsize cities or on or near college campuses we use geographic information software which incorporates variables such as traffic volumes competitor locations household demographics and visibility to evaluate and identify potential store locations and new markets 

  

productionoriented store designs 

our typical store is relatively small occupying approximately 1000 to 1300 square feet and is designed with a focus on efficient and timely production of consistently high quality pizza for delivery the store layout has been refined over time to provide an efficient flow from order taking to delivery our stores are primarily production facilities and accordingly do not typically have a dinein area 

product and process innovations 

our 48 years of experience and innovative culture have resulted in numerous new product and process developments that increase both quality and efficiency these include our efficient verticallyintegrated supply chain system a sturdier corrugated pizza box and a mesh screen that helps cook pizza crust more evenly the domino’s heatwave ® hot bag which was introduced in 1998 keeps our pizzas hot during delivery we also continue to introduce new products such as domino’s oven baked sandwiches which we launched in 2008 additionally we have added a number of complementary side items to our menu such as buffalo wings domino’s buffalo chicken kickers ®  bread sticks cheesy bread and cinna stix ®  

focused menu 

we maintain a focused menu that is designed to present an attractive quality offering to customers while minimizing order errors and expediting the order taking and food preparation processes our basic menu has three choices for pizza products pizza type pizza size and pizza toppings most of our stores carry two or three sizes of traditional handtossed ultimate deep dish brooklyn style and crunchy thin crust pizza during 2008 we added the new domino’s oven baked sandwiches to our menu that are available in four main varieties our typical store also offers buffalo wings domino’s buffalo chicken kickers ®  bread sticks cheesy bread cinna stix ® and cocacola ® soft drink products we also occasionally offer other products on a promotional basis we believe that our focused menu creates a strong identity among consumers improves operating efficiency and maintains food quality and consistency

domino’s pulse™ pointofsale system 

our computerized management information systems are designed to improve operating efficiencies provide corporate management with timely access to financial and marketing data and reduce store and corporate administrative time and expense we have installed domino’s pulse™ our proprietary pointofsale system in every companyowned store in the united states and significantly all of our domestic franchise stores some enhanced features of domino’s pulse™ over our previous pointofsale system include 

• touch screen ordering which improves accuracy and facilitates more efficient order taking 

• a delivery driver routing system which improves delivery efficiency 

• improved administrative and reporting capabilities which enable store managers to better focus on store operations and customer 

satisfaction and 

• enhanced online ordering capability including pizza tracker which was introduced in 2007 

we require our domestic franchisees to install domino’s pulse™ and are in the process of installing domino’s pulse™ in the remaining domestic franchise stores additionally we have installed domino’s pulse™ in over 1000 international franchise stores 

comprehensive store audit program 

we utilize a comprehensive store audit program to ensure that our stores are meeting both our stringent standards as well as the expectations of our customers the audit program focuses primarily on the quality of the pizza the store is producing the customer service the store is providing and the condition of the store as viewed by the customer we believe that this store audit program is an integral part of our strategy to maintain high standards in our stores 

  

segment overview 

we operate in three business segments 

• domestic stores our domestic stores segment consists of our domestic franchise operations which oversee our network of 4558 franchise stores located in the contiguous united states and our domestic companyowned store operations which operate our network of 489 companyowned stores located in the contiguous united states 

• domestic supply chain our domestic supply chain segment operates 17 regional dough manufacturing and food supply chain centers one supply chain center providing equipment and supplies to certain of our domestic and international stores and one vegetable processing supply chain center and 

• international our international segment oversees our network of 3726 international franchise stores in more than 60 countries our international segment also distributes food to a limited number of markets from six dough manufacturing and supply chain centers in alaska hawaii and canada four 

domestic stores 

during 2008 our domestic stores segment accounted for 5116 million or 36 of our consolidated revenues our domestic franchises are operated by entrepreneurs who own and operate an average of three to four stores only six of our domestic franchisees operate more than 50 stores including our largest domestic franchisee which operates 144 stores our principal sources of revenues from domestic store operations are companyowned store sales and royalty payments based on retail sales by our franchisees our domestic network of companyowned stores also plays an important strategic role in our predominantly franchised operating structure in addition to generating revenues and earnings we use our domestic companyowned stores as test sites for new products and promotions as well as store operational improvements and as forums for training new store managers and prospective franchisees we also believe that our domestic companyowned stores add to the economies of scale available for advertising marketing and other costs that are primarily borne by our franchisees while we continue to be primarily a franchised business we continually evaluate our mix of domestic companyowned and franchise stores in an effort to optimize our profitability 

our domestic companyowned store operations are divided into eleven geographic areas located throughout the contiguous united states while our domestic franchise operations are divided into four regions our team members within these areas provide direct supervision over our domestic companyowned stores provide training store operational audits and marketing services and provide financial analysis and store development services to our franchisees we maintain a close relationship with our franchise stores through regional franchise teams an array of computerbased training materials that help franchise stores comply with our standards and franchise advisory groups that facilitate communications between us and our franchisees 

domestic supply chain 

during 2008 our domestic supply chain segment accounted for 7711 million or 54 of our consolidated revenues our domestic supply chain segment is comprised of dough manufacturing and supply chain centers that manufacture fresh dough on a daily basis and purchase receive store and deliver quality pizzarelated food products and complementary side items to all of our companyowned stores and over 99 of our domestic franchise stores each regional dough manufacturing and supply chain center serves approximately 300 stores generally located within a oneday delivery radius we regularly supply approximately 5000 stores with various supplies and ingredients of which eight product groups account for over 90 of the volume our domestic supply chain segment made approximately 575000 fullservice deliveries in 2008 or between two and three deliveries per store per week and we produced over 273 million pounds of dough during 2008 

we believe that our franchisees voluntarily choose to obtain food supplies and equipment from us because we provide the most efficient convenient and costeffective alternative while also providing both quality and consistency in addition our domestic supply chain segment offers a profitsharing arrangement to stores that purchase all of their food from our domestic dough manufacturing and supply chain centers this profitsharing arrangement generally provides domestic companyowned stores and participating franchisees with 50 of their regional supply chain center’s pretax profits profits are shared with the franchisees based upon each franchisee’s purchases from our supply chain centers we believe these arrangements strengthen our ties with these franchisees 

  

the information systems used by our domestic dough manufacturing and supply chain centers are an integral part of the quality service we provide our stores we use routing strategies and software to optimize our daily delivery schedules which maximizes ontime deliveries through our strategic dough manufacturing and supply chain center locations and proven routing systems we achieved delivery accuracy rates of approximately 99 during 2008 our supply chain center drivers unload food and supplies and stock store shelves typically during nonpeak store hours which minimizes disruptions in store operations 

international 

during 2008 our international segment accounted for 1424 million or 10 of our consolidated revenues we have 592 franchise stores in mexico representing the largest presence of any qsr company in mexico 512 franchise stores in the united kingdom 412 franchise stores in australia 305 franchise stores in south korea 296 franchise stores in canada 227 franchise stores in india and over 100 franchise stores in each of japan france taiwan and turkey the principal sources of revenues from our international operations are royalty payments generated by retail sales from franchise stores and sales of food and supplies to franchisees in certain markets 

we have grown by more than 1200 international stores over the past five years we empower our managers and franchisees to adapt the standard operating model within certain parameters to satisfy the local eating habits and consumer preferences of various regions outside the contiguous united states currently most of our international stores are operated under master franchise agreements and we plan to continue entering into master franchise agreements with qualified franchisees to expand our international operations in selected countries we believe that our international franchise stores appeal to potential franchisees because of our wellrecognized brand name the limited capital expenditures required to open and operate our stores and our system’s favorable store economics the following table shows our store count as of december 28 2008 in our top ten international markets which account for 78 of our international stores 

 

 our franchise program 

as of december 28 2008 our 4558 domestic franchise stores were owned and operated by our 1216 domestic franchisees the success of our franchise formula which enables franchisees to benefit from our brand name with a relatively low initial capital investment has attracted a large number of motivated entrepreneurs as franchisees as of december 28 2008 the average domestic franchisee operated approximately three to four stores and had been in our franchise system for twelve years at the same time only six of our domestic franchisees operated more than 50 stores including our largest domestic franchisee which operates 144 stores 

domestic franchisees 

we apply rigorous standards to prospective franchisees we generally require prospective domestic franchisees to manage a store for at least one year before being granted a franchise this enables us to observe the operational and financial performance of a potential franchisee prior to entering into a longterm contract we also generally restrict the ability of domestic franchisees to become involved in other businesses which focuses our franchisees’ attention on operating their stores as a result the vast majority of our franchisees come from within the domino’s pizza system we believe these standards are unique to the franchise industry and result in qualified and focused franchisees operating their stores 

  

franchise agreements 

we enter into franchise agreements with domestic franchisees under which the franchisee is granted the right to operate a store in a particular location for a term of ten years with options to renew for an additional term of ten years we currently have a franchise contract renewal rate of over 99 under the current standard franchise agreement we assign an exclusive area of primary responsibility to each franchise store during the term of the franchise agreement the franchisee is required to pay a 55 royalty fee on sales subject in limited instances to lower rates based on area development agreements sales initiatives and new store incentives we have the contractual right subject to state law to terminate a franchise agreement for a variety of reasons including but not limited to a franchisee’s failure to make required payments when due or failure to adhere to specified company policies and standards 

franchise store development 

we provide domestic franchisees with assistance in selecting store sites and conforming the space to the physical specifications required for a domino’s pizza store each domestic franchisee selects the location and design for each store subject to our approval based on accessibility and visibility of the site and demographic factors including population density and anticipated traffic levels we provide design plans and sell fixtures and equipment to most of our franchise stores 

franchise training and support 

training store managers and employees is a critical component of our success we require all domestic franchisees to complete initial and ongoing training programs provided by us in addition under the standard domestic franchise agreement domestic franchisees are required to implement training programs for their store employees we assist our domestic and international franchisees by making training materials available to them for their use in training store managers and employees including computerbased training materials comprehensive operations manuals and franchise development classes we also maintain communications with our franchisees online through various newsletters and through facetoface meetings 

franchise operations 

we enforce stringent standards over franchise operations to protect the domino’s pizza ® brand all franchisees are required to operate their stores in compliance with written policies standards and specifications which include matters such as menu items ingredients materials supplies services furnishings decor and signs each franchisee has full discretion to determine the prices to be charged to customers we also provide ongoing support to our franchisees including training marketing assistance and consultation to franchisees who experience financial or operational difficulties we have established several advisory boards through which franchisees contribute to developing systemwide initiatives

the vast majority of our markets outside of the contiguous united states are operated by master franchisees with franchise and distribution rights for entire regions or countries in select regions or countries we franchise directly to individual store operators our master franchise agreements generally grant the franchisee exclusive rights to develop or subfranchise stores and the right to operate supply chain centers in a particular geographic area for a term of ten to twenty years with options to renew for additional terms the agreements typically contain growth clauses requiring franchisees to open a minimum number of stores within a specified period prospective master franchisees are required to possess or have access to local market knowledge required to establish and develop domino’s pizza stores the local market knowledge focuses on the ability to identify and access targeted real estate sites along with expertise in local customs culture consumer behavior and laws we also seek candidates that have access to sufficient capital to meet their growth and development plans the master franchisee is generally required to pay an initial onetime franchise fee as well as an additional franchise fee upon the opening of each new store in addition the master franchisee is required to pay a continuing royalty fee as a percentage of retail sales which varies among international markets 

  

marketing operations 

our domestic stores generally contribute between 4 to 5 of their retail sales to fund national marketing and advertising campaigns in addition to the required national advertising contributions in those markets where we have cooperative advertising programs our domestic stores also generally contribute to marketlevel media campaigns these national and marketlevel funds are administered by domino’s national advertising fund inc or dnaf our notforprofit advertising subsidiary the funds remitted to dnaf are used primarily to purchase television advertising but also support market research field communications public relations commercial production talent payments and other activities supporting the domino’s pizza ® brand dnaf also provides costeffective print materials to our domestic stores for use in local marketing that reinforce our national branding strategy in addition to the national and marketlevel advertising contributions domestic stores spend additional amounts on local store marketing including targeted database mailings saturation print mailings and community involvement through school and civic organizations additionally we may from timetotime partner with other organizations in an effort to promote the domino’s pizza ® brand 

by communicating a common brand message at the national local market and store levels we create and reinforce a powerful consistent marketing message to consumers this is evidenced by our successful previous marketing campaign with the slogan “get the door it’s domino’s ® ” and our current marketing campaign with the slogan “you got 30 minutes™” over the past five years we estimate that domestic stores have invested approximately 14 billion on national local and cooperative advertising 

internationally marketing efforts are primarily the responsibility of the franchisee in each local market we assist international franchisees with their marketing efforts through marketing workshops and sharing of best practices and successful concepts 

thirdparty suppliers 

we have maintained active relationships of 15 years or more with more than half of our major suppliers our suppliers are required to meet strict quality standards to ensure food safety we review and evaluate our suppliers’ quality assurance programs through among other actions onsite visits third party audits and product evaluations to ensure compliance with our standards we believe that the length and quality of our relationships with suppliers provides us with priority service and quality products at competitive prices 

we believe that two factors have been critical to maintaining longlasting relationships and keeping our purchasing costs low first we are one of the largest domestic volume purchasers of pizzarelated products such as flour cheese sauce and pizza boxes which allows us to maximize leverage with our suppliers when items are put out for bid on a scheduled basis second we use a combination of singlesource and multisource procurement strategies each supply category is evaluated along a number of criteria including value of purchasing leverage consistency of quality and reliability of supply to determine the appropriate number of suppliers 

we currently purchase our pizza cheese from a single supplier in 2007 the company entered into a new arrangement with this supplier under this arrangement the supplier agreed to provide an uninterrupted supply of cheese and the company agreed to a five year pricing period during which it agreed to purchase all of its primary pizza cheese for the company’s united states stores from this supplier or alternatively pay to the supplier an amount reflecting any benefit previously received by the company under the new pricing terms the pricing schedule is directly correlated to the cme block cheddar price the majority of our meat toppings come from a single supplier under a contract that began in july 2008 and expires in july 2010 the crunchy thin crust dough is currently sourced by another single supplier pursuant to requirements contracts that expire in 2009 we have the right to terminate these arrangements for quality failures and for uncured breaches 

we believe that alternative suppliers for all of these ingredients are available and all of our pizza boxes sauces and other ingredients are sourced from various suppliers while we may incur additional costs if we are required to replace any of our suppliers we do not believe that such additional costs would have a material adverse effect on our business we also entered into a multiyear agreement with cocacola effective january 1 2003 for the contiguous united states the contract provides for cocacola to be our exclusive beverage supplier and expires on the later of december 31 2009 or such time as a minimum number of cases of cocacola ® products are purchased by us we continually evaluate each supply category to determine the optimal sourcing strategy 

  

we have not experienced any significant shortages of supplies or any delays in receiving our food or beverage inventories restaurant supplies or products the current economic environment has created additional financial pressures for some of our suppliers however we do not currently anticipate disruptions in our supplies prices charged to us by our suppliers are subject to fluctuation and we have historically been able to pass increased costs and savings on to our stores we may periodically enter into financial instruments to manage the risk from changes in commodity prices we do not engage in speculative transactions nor do we hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes 

competition 

us and international pizza delivery and carryout are highly competitive domestically we compete against regional and local companies as well as national chains pizza hut ® and papa john’s ®  internationally we compete against pizza hut ® and regional and local companies we generally compete on the basis of product quality location image service and price we also compete on a broader scale with quick service and other international national regional and local restaurants in addition the overall food service industry and the qsr sector in particular are intensely competitive with respect to product quality price service convenience and concept the industry is often affected by changes in consumer tastes economic conditions demographic trends and consumers’ disposable income we compete within the food service industry and the qsr sector not only for customers but also for personnel suitable real estate sites and qualified franchisees 

government regulation 

we are subject to various federal state and local laws affecting the operation of our business as are our franchisees including various health sanitation fire and safety standards each store is subject to licensing and regulation by a number of governmental authorities which include zoning health safety sanitation building and fire agencies in the jurisdiction in which the store is located in connection with the reimaging of our stores we may be required to expend funds to meet certain federal state and local regulations including regulations requiring that remodeled or altered stores be accessible to persons with disabilities difficulties in obtaining or the failure to obtain required licenses or approvals could delay or prevent the opening of a new store in a particular area or cause an existing store to cease operations our supply chain facilities are licensed and subject to similar regulations by federal state and local health and fire codes 

we are also subject to the fair labor standards act and various other federal and state laws governing such matters as minimum wage requirements overtime and other working conditions and citizenship requirements a significant number of our food service personnel are paid at rates related to the applicable minimum wage and past increases in the minimum wage have increased our labor costs as would future increases 

we are subject to the rules and regulations of the federal trade commission and various state laws regulating the offer and sale of franchises the federal trade commission and various state laws require that we furnish a franchise disclosure document containing certain information to prospective franchisees and a number of states require registration of the franchise disclosure document with state authorities we are operating under exemptions from registration in several states based on the net worth of our operating subsidiary domino’s pizza llc and experience substantive state laws that regulate the franchisorfranchisee relationship presently exist in a substantial number of states and bills have been introduced in congress from time to time that would provide for federal regulation of the franchisorfranchisee relationship the state laws often limit among other things the duration and scope of noncompetition provisions the ability of a franchisor to terminate or refuse to renew a franchise and the ability of a franchisor to designate sources of supply we believe that our franchise disclosure document together with any applicable state versions or supplements and franchising procedures comply in all material respects with both the federal trade commission guidelines and all applicable state laws regulating franchising in those states in which we have offered franchises 

internationally our franchise stores are subject to national and local laws and regulations that often are similar to those affecting our domestic stores including laws and regulations concerning franchises labor health sanitation and safety our international stores are also often subject to tariffs and regulations on imported commodities and equipment and laws regulating foreign investment we believe that our international disclosure statements franchise offering documents and franchising procedures comply in all material respects with the laws of the foreign countries in which we have offered franchises 

  

trademarks 

we have many registered trademarks and service marks and believe that the domino’s ® mark and domino’s pizza ® names and logos in particular have significant value and are important to our business our policy is to pursue registration of our trademarks and to vigorously oppose the infringement of any of our trademarks we license the use of our registered marks to franchisees through franchise agreements 

environmental matters 

we are not aware of any federal state or local environmental laws or regulations that will materially affect our earnings or competitive position or result in material capital expenditures however we cannot predict the effect of possible future environmental legislation or regulations during 2008 there were no material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities and no such material expenditures are anticipated in 2009 

employees 

as of december 28 2008 we had approximately 10500 employees who we refer to as team members in our companyowned stores supply chain centers world resource center our corporate headquarters and regional offices as franchisees are independent business owners they and their employees are not included in our employee count we consider our relationship with our employees and franchisees to be good we estimate the total number of people who work in the domino’s pizza system including our employees franchisees and the employees of franchisees was over 175000 as of december 28 2008 

none of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement 

safety 

our commitment to safety is embodied in our hiring training and review process before an applicant is considered for hire as a delivery driver in the united states motor vehicle records are reviewed to ensure a minimum safe driving record of one or two years in addition we require regular checks of driving records and proof of insurance for delivery drivers throughout their employment with us each domestic domino’s driver including drivers employed by franchisees are required to complete our safe delivery training program we have also implemented several safe driving incentive programs 

our safety and security department oversees security matters for our domestic companyowned stores and provides assistance to our franchisees as requested regional security and safety directors oversee security measures at domestic companyowned store locations and assist local authorities in investigations of incidents involving our stores or personnel 

community activities 

we believe in supporting the communities we serve and we base our corporate giving on three simple elements delivering charitable support to our own team members to our customers and to national programs 

national philanthropic partner 

we have a tradition of creating multiyear partnerships with a national charity to raise funds and public awareness for the organization our current national philanthropic partner is st jude children’s research hospital st jude is internationally recognized for its pioneering work in finding cures and saving children with cancer and other catastrophic diseases through a variety of internal and consumerbased activities including a national fundraising campaign called thanks and giving the domino’s pizza system has contributed more than 45 million to st jude in the first five years of the partnership in addition to raising funds the domino’s pizza system has supported st jude through inkind donations including hosting hospitalwide pizza parties for patients and their families the domino’s pizza system also helps st jude build awareness through the inclusion of the st jude logo on millions of our pizza boxes and through a link on our consumer web site

research and development 

we operate research and product development facilities at our world resource center in ann arbor michigan companysponsored research and development activities which include among other things testing new products for possible menu additions are an important activity to us and our franchisees we do not consider the amounts spent on research and development to be material

 item 1a risk factors 

risks relating to our business and industry 

the pizza category is highly competitive and such competition could adversely affect our operating results 

we compete in the united states against two national chains as well as many regional and local businesses we could experience increased competition from existing or new companies in the pizza category which could create increasing pressures to grow our business in order to maintain our market share if we are unable to maintain our competitive position we could experience downward pressure on prices lower demand for our products reduced margins the inability to take advantage of new business opportunities and the loss of market share all of which would have an adverse effect on our operating results and could cause our stock price to decline 

we also compete on a broader scale with quick service and other international national regional and local restaurants the overall food service market and the quick service restaurant sector are intensely competitive with respect to food quality price service image convenience and concept and are often affected by changes in 

• consumer tastes 

• national regional or local economic conditions 

• disposable purchasing power 

• demographic trends and 

• currency fluctuations to the extent international operations are involved 

we compete within the food service market and the quick service restaurant sector not only for customers but also for management and hourly employees suitable real estate sites and qualified franchisees our domestic supply chain segment is also subject to competition from outside suppliers if other suppliers who meet our qualification standards were to offer lower prices or better service to our franchisees for their ingredients and supplies and as a result our franchisees chose not to purchase from our domestic supply chain centers our financial condition business and results of operations would be adversely affected 

if we fail to successfully implement our growth strategy which includes opening new domestic and international stores our ability to increase our revenues and operating profits could be adversely affected 

a significant component of our growth strategy is opening new domestic and international stores we and our franchisees face many challenges in opening new stores including among others 

• selection and availability of suitable store locations 

• negotiation of acceptable lease or financing terms 

• securing required domestic or foreign governmental permits and approvals 

• employment and training of qualified personnel and 

• general economic and business conditions 

the opening of additional franchise stores also depends in part upon the availability of prospective franchisees who meet our criteria our failure to add a significant number of new stores would adversely affect our ability to increase revenues and operating income 

  

we are currently planning to expand our international operations in many of the markets where we currently operate and in selected new markets this may require considerable management time as well as startup expenses for market development before any significant revenues and earnings are generated operations in new foreign markets may achieve low margins or may be unprofitable and expansion in existing markets may by affected by local economic and market conditions therefore as we expand internationally we may not experience the operating margins we expect our results of operations may be negatively impacted and our common stock price may decline 

we may also pursue strategic acquisitions as part of our business if we are able to identify acquisition candidates such acquisitions may be financed to the extent permitted under our debt agreements with substantial debt or with potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities 

the food service market is affected by consumer preferences and perceptions changes in these preferences and perceptions may lessen the demand for our products which would reduce sales and harm our business 

food service businesses are affected by changes in consumer tastes national regional and local economic conditions and demographic trends for instance if prevailing health or dietary preferences cause consumers to avoid pizza and other products we offer in favor of foods that are perceived as more healthy our business and operating results would be harmed moreover because we are primarily dependent on a single product if consumer demand for pizza should decrease our business would suffer more than if we had a more diversified menu as many other food service businesses do 

increases in food labor and other costs could adversely affect our profitability and operating results 

an increase in our operating costs could adversely affect our profitability factors such as inflation increased food costs increased labor and employee benefit costs and increased energy costs may adversely affect our operating costs most of the factors affecting costs are beyond our control and in many cases we may not be able to pass along these increased costs to our customers or franchisees most ingredients used in our pizza particularly cheese are subject to significant price fluctuations as a result of seasonality weather demand and other factors the cheese block price per pound averaged 189 in 2008 and the estimated increase in companyowned store food costs from a hypothetical 025 adverse change in the average cheese block price per pound would have been approximately 23 million in 2008 labor costs are largely a function of the minimum wage for a majority of our store personnel and certain supply chain center personnel and generally are a function of the availability of labor food including cheese costs and labor represent approximately 50 to 60 of a typical companyowned store’s cost of sales 

our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our business and limit our ability to plan for or respond to changes in our business 

as a result of the 2007 recapitalization we hold a substantial amount of indebtedness and are highly leveraged as of december 28 2008 our consolidated longterm indebtedness was 17 billion we may also incur additional debt which would not be prohibited under the terms of the securitized debt our substantial indebtedness and the fact that a large portion of our cash flow from operations must be used to make payments on our indebtedness could have important consequences to our business and our shareholders for example they could 

• make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our debt agreements 

• increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions 

• require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness thereby reducing the 

availability of our cash flow for other purposes and 

• limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and the industry in which we operate thereby placing us 

at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that may have less debt 

in addition the financial and other covenants we agreed to with our lenders will limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness make investments pay dividends and engage in other transactions and the leverage may cause potential lenders to be less willing to loan funds to us in the future our failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default that if not cured or waived could result in the acceleration of repayment of all of our indebtedness 

  

we may be unable to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our significant debt service obligations which would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

our ability to make principal and interest payments on and to refinance our indebtedness will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future this to a certain extent is subject to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control if our business does not generate sufficient cash flow from operations if currently anticipated cost savings and operating improvements are not realized on schedule in the amounts projected or at all or if future borrowings are not available to us under our variable funding notes in amounts sufficient to fund our other liquidity needs our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected if we cannot generate sufficient cash flow from operations to make scheduled principal and interest payments on our debt obligations in the future we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity sell assets delay capital expenditures or seek additional equity if we are unable to refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all or to effect any other action relating to our indebtedness on satisfactory terms or at all our business may be harmed 

the terms of our securitized debt financing of certain of our whollyowned subsidiaries have restrictive terms and our failure to comply with any of these terms could put us in default which would have an adverse effect on our business and prospects 

unless and until we repay all outstanding borrowings under our securitized debt we will remain subject to the restrictive terms of these borrowings the securitized debt under which certain of our whollyowned subsidiaries issued and guaranteed senior and subordinated fixed rate notes and variable funding senior revolving notes contain a number of covenants with the most significant financial covenant being a debt service coverage calculation these covenants limit the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to among other things 

• sell assets 

• alter the business we conduct 

• engage in mergers acquisitions and other business combinations 

• declare dividends or redeem or repurchase capital stock 

• incur assume or permit to exist additional indebtedness or guarantees 

• make loans and investments 

• incur liens and 

• enter into transactions with affiliates 

the securitized debt also requires us to maintain a specified financial ratio at the end of each fiscal quarter these restrictions could affect our ability to pay dividends or repurchase shares of our common stock our ability to meet this financial ratio can be affected by events beyond our control and we may not satisfy such a test a breach of this covenant could result in a rapid amortization event or default under the securitized debt if amounts owed under the securitized debt are accelerated because of a default under the securitized debt and we are unable to pay such amounts the insurers have the right to assume control of substantially all of the securitized assets 

in the event that one or both of the insurance companies that provide financial guaranties of our fixed and variable funding note payments were to become the subject of insolvency or similar proceedings our lenders would not be required to fund our variable funding notes additionally under the terms of our indenture governing our notes an event of default would occur if i one or both of the insurance companies were to become the subject of insolvency or similar proceedings and ii the related insurance policy were not continued or sold to a third party who would assume one or both of the insurance companies’ obligations under the related policies but instead were terminated or canceled as a result of those proceedings in an event of default all unpaid amounts under the fixed and variable rate notes could become immediately due and payable at the direction or consent of holders of a majority of the outstanding fixed rate notes or the remaining insurance company that is not the subject of insolvency or similar proceedings such acceleration of our debt could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity if we were unable to negotiate mutually acceptable terms with our lenders or if alternate funding were not available to us 

we expect that during the first five years following issuance the senior notes will accrue interest at a fixed rate of 5261 per year and the subordinated notes will accrue interest at a fixed rate of 7629 if we do not exercise either of our two oneyear extension options following the fiveyear interestonly period our securitized debt will be subject to principal amortization and may also be subject to an increased interest rate if it is not repaid or refinanced if we do exercise one or both extensions then we may be subject to an increased interest rate 

  

if we are unable to refinance or repay amounts under the securitized debt prior to the expiration of the fiveyear interestonly term six or sevenyear interestonly term if we satisfy certain conditions and exercise one or both of our oneyear extension elections our cash flow would be directed to the repayment of the securitized debt and other than a weekly servicing fee sufficient to cover minimal selling general and administrative expenses would not be available for operating our business 

no assurance can be given that any refinancing or additional financing will be possible when needed or that we will be able to negotiate acceptable terms in addition our access to capital is affected by prevailing conditions in the financial and capital markets and other factors beyond our control there can be no assurance that market conditions will be favorable at the times that we require new or additional financing 

the indenture governing the securitized debt will restrict the cash flow from the entities subject to the securitization to any of our other entities and upon the occurrence of certain events cash flow would be further restricted 

in the event that a rapid amortization event occurs under the indenture including without limitation upon an event of default under the indenture or the failure to repay the securitized debt at the end of the five year interestonly period or at the end of any extension period the funds available to us will be reduced or eliminated which would in turn reduce our ability to operate or grow our business 

we do not have longterm contracts with certain of our suppliers and as a result they could seek to significantly increase prices or fail to deliver 

we do not have written contracts or formal longterm arrangements with certain of our suppliers although in the past we have not experienced significant problems with our suppliers our suppliers may implement significant price increases or may not meet our requirements in a timely fashion if at all the occurrence of any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

shortages or interruptions in the supply or delivery of fresh food products could adversely affect our operating results 

we and our franchisees are dependent on frequent deliveries of fresh food products that meet our specifications shortages or interruptions in the supply of fresh food products caused by unanticipated demand problems in production or distribution financial or other difficulties of suppliers inclement weather or other conditions could adversely affect the availability quality and cost of ingredients which would adversely affect our operating results 

any prolonged disruption in the operations of any of our dough manufacturing and supply chain centers could harm our business 

we operate 17 regional dough manufacturing and supply chain centers and one vegetable processing supply chain center in the contiguous united states and a total of six dough manufacturing and supply chain centers in alaska hawaii and canada our domestic dough manufacturing and supply chain centers service all of our companyowned stores and over 99 of our domestic franchise stores as a result any prolonged disruption in the operations of any of these facilities whether due to technical or labor difficulties destruction or damage to the facility real estate issues or other reasons could adversely affect our business and operating results 

we face risks of litigation from customers franchisees employees and others in the ordinary course of business which diverts our financial and management resources any adverse litigation or publicity may negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations 

claims of illness or injury relating to food quality or food handling are common in the food service industry in addition class action lawsuits have been filed and may continue to be filed against various quick service restaurants alleging among other things that quick service restaurants have failed to disclose the health risks associated with highfat foods and that quick service restaurant marketing practices have encouraged obesity in addition to decreasing our sales and profitability and diverting our management resources adverse publicity or a substantial judgment against us could negatively impact our financial condition results of operations and brand reputation hindering our ability to attract and retain franchisees and grow our business 

further we may be subject to employee franchisee and other claims in the future based on among other things discrimination harassment wrongful termination and wage rest break and meal break issues including those relating to overtime compensation we have been subject to these types of claims in the past and in 2007 settled a purported class action claim of this type in california relating to rest break and meal break compensation if one or more of these claims were to be successful or if there is a significant increase in the number of these claims our business financial condition and operating results could be harmed 

  

loss of key personnel or our inability to attract and retain new qualified personnel could hurt our business and inhibit our ability to operate and grow successfully 

our success in the highly competitive business of pizza delivery will continue to depend to a significant extent on our leadership team and other key management personnel other than with our chairman and chief executive officer david a brandon we do not have longterm employment agreements with any of our executive officers as a result we may not be able to retain our executive officers and key personnel or attract additional qualified management our success also will continue to depend on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel to operate our stores dough manufacturing and supply chain centers and international operations the loss of these employees or our inability to recruit and retain qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 

our international operations subject us to additional risk such risks and costs may differ in each country in which we do business and may cause our profitability to decline due to increased costs 

we conduct a portion of our business outside the united states our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected if global markets in which our franchise stores compete are affected by changes in political economic or other factors these factors over which neither we nor our franchisees have control may include 

• recessionary or expansive trends in international markets 

• changing labor conditions and difficulties in staffing and managing our foreign operations 

• increases in the taxes we pay and other changes in applicable tax laws 

• legal and regulatory changes and the burdens and costs of our compliance with a variety of foreign laws 

• changes in inflation rates 

• changes in exchange rates and the imposition of restrictions on currency conversion or the transfer of funds 

• difficulty in collecting our royalties and longer payment cycles 

• expropriation of private enterprises 

• political and economic instability and 

• other external factors 

fluctuations in the value of the us dollar in relation to other currencies may lead to lower revenues and earnings 

exchange rate fluctuations could have an adverse effect on our results of operations approximately 86 87 and 100 of our total revenues were derived from our international segment in 2006 2007 and 2008 respectively a majority of which were denominated in foreign currencies sales made by our stores outside the united states are denominated in the currency of the country in which the store is located and this currency could become less valuable prior to conversion to us dollars as a result of exchange rate fluctuations unfavorable currency fluctuations could lead to increased prices to customers outside the united states or lower profitability to our franchisees outside the united states or could result in lower revenues for us on a us dollar basis from such customers and franchisees 

we may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property which could harm the value of our brand and branded products and adversely affect our business 

we depend in large part on our brand and branded products and believe that they are very important to our business we rely on a combination of trademarks copyrights service marks trade secrets and similar intellectual property rights to protect our brand and branded products the success of our business depends on our continued ability to use our existing trademarks and service marks in order to increase brand awareness and further develop our branded products in both domestic and international markets we have registered certain trademarks and have other trademark registrations pending in the united states and foreign jurisdictions not all of the trademarks that we currently use have been registered in all of the countries in which we do business and they may never be registered in all of these countries we may not be able to adequately protect our trademarks and our use of these trademarks may result in liability for trademark infringement trademark dilution or unfair competition all of the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property in the united states and in foreign countries may not be adequate in addition the laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states further through acquisitions of third parties we may acquire brands and related trademarks that are subject to the same risks as the brands and trademarks we currently own 

we may from time to time be required to institute litigation to enforce our trademarks or other intellectual property rights or to protect our trade secrets such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could negatively affect our sales profitability and prospects regardless of whether we are able to successfully enforce our rights 

  

our earnings and business growth strategy depends on the success of our franchisees and we may be harmed by actions taken by our franchisees that are outside of our control 

a significant portion of our earnings comes from royalties generated by our franchise stores franchisees are independent operators and their employees are not our employees we provide limited training and support to franchisees but the quality of franchise store operations may be diminished by any number of factors beyond our control consequently franchisees may not successfully operate stores in a manner consistent with our standards and requirements or may not hire and train qualified managers and other store personnel if they do not our image and reputation may suffer and our revenues and stock price could decline while we try to ensure that our franchisees maintain the quality of our brand and branded products our franchisees may take actions that adversely affect the value of our intellectual property or reputation as of december 28 2008 we had 1216 domestic franchisees operating 4558 domestic stores six of these franchisees each operate over 50 domestic stores including our largest domestic franchisee which operates 144 stores and the average franchisee operates three to four stores in addition our international master franchisees are generally responsible for the development of significantly more stores than our domestic franchisees as a result our international operations are more closely tied to the success of a smaller number of franchisees than our domestic operations our largest international master franchisee operates 729 stores in five markets which accounts for approximately 20 of our total international store count our domestic and international franchisees may not operate their franchises successfully if one or more of our key franchisees were to become insolvent or otherwise were unable or unwilling to pay us our royalties or other amounts owed our business and results of operations would be adversely affected 

we are subject to extensive government regulation and our failure to comply with existing or increased regulations could adversely affect our business and operating results

 item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

overview 

our fiscal year typically includes 52 weeks comprised of three twelve week quarters and one sixteen week quarter fiscal 2006 fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2008 each consisted of 52 weeks 

description of the business 

we are the number one pizza delivery company in the united states with a 175 share of the pizza delivery market based on reported consumer spending we also have a leading international presence we operate through a network of 489 companyowned stores all of which are in the united states and 8284 franchise stores located in all 50 states and in more than 60 countries in addition we operate 17 regional dough manufacturing and supply chain centers in the contiguous united states as well as six dough manufacturing and supply chain centers outside the contiguous united states 

our financial results are driven largely by retail sales at our companyowned and franchise stores changes in retail sales are driven by changes in same store sales and store counts we monitor both of these metrics very closely as they directly impact our revenues and profits and strive to consistently increase the related amounts retail sales drive companyowned store revenues royalty payments from franchisees and domestic supply chain revenues retail sales are primarily impacted by the strength of the domino’s pizza ® brand the success of our marketing promotions and our ability to execute our store operating model and other business strategies 

we devote significant attention to our brandbuilding efforts which is evident in our system’s estimated 14 billion of domestic advertising spending over the past five years and our frequent designation as a megabrand by advertising age  we plan on continuing to build our brand and retail sales by satisfying customers worldwide with our pizza delivery offerings and by continuing to invest significant amounts in the advertising and marketing of the domino’s pizza ® brand 

we also pay particular attention to the store economics or the investment performance of a store to its owner of both our companyowned and franchise stores we believe that our system’s favorable store economics benefit from the relatively small initial and ongoing investments required to own and operate a domino’s pizza store we believe these favorable investment requirements coupled with a strong brand message supported by significant advertising spending as well as highquality and focused menu offerings drive strong store economics which in turn drive demand for new stores 

business performance 

during 2008 we faced significant challenges in our domestic business particularly rising commodity costs a continued trend of negative domestic same store sales growth and a slowdown in our store growth as we experienced net negative domestic store growth these factors combined with the current economic environment have negatively impacted our operating results as well as those of our franchisees as a result it was an important year for us to refine our strategies and plans for the coming years which include improving our franchise base improving performance of our companyowned stores and strengthening our menu we plan to continue exiting underperforming franchisees from the system which will allow us to strengthen our overall system of stores however this will continue to negatively impact our domestic store growth in 2009 our marketing strategies will focus on driving sustained traffic growth including launching permanent new product platforms in 2008 we introduced our new domino’s oven baked sandwiches which not only drove traffic growth but also expanded our lunch business in addition to the aforementioned efforts other initiatives such as increases in media spending and investments in training and retention of team members are important strategies that will contribute to the growth and success of our business 

in 2008 global retail sales which are total retail sales at companyowned and franchise stores worldwide increased 14 as compared to 2007 this increase in global retail sales was driven by strong international same store sales growth as well as growth in worldwide store counts offset in part by a decrease in domestic same store sales and negative foreign currency translation impacts on our international sales in 2007 global retail sales increased 66 as compared to 2006 this increase in global retail sales was driven by strong international same store sales growth as well as growth in worldwide store counts offset in part by a decrease in domestic franchise same store sales 

  

revenues increased 256 million or 18 in 2007 and decreased 378 million or 26 in 2008 the increase in revenues in 2007 was largely due to higher domestic supply chain revenues due primarily to higher food prices including cheese the decline in 2008 was due primarily to lower companyowned store and domestic franchise revenues driven primarily by companyowned store divestitures lower same store sales and lower volumes in our domestic supply chain operations worldwide store counts have increased from 8079 at the beginning of 2006 to 8773 at the end of 2008 this growth in store counts can be attributed to the growing global acceptance of our brand and our pizza delivery concept as well as the economics inherent in our system which attracts new franchisees and encourages existing franchisees to grow their business domestic same store sales decreased 41 17 and 49 in 2006 2007 and 2008 respectively international same store sales increased 40 67 and 62 during the same periods the company’s domestic same store sales results in 2006 2007 and 2008 reflected the underperformance of our product and promotional offerings during those years continued challenges in our domestic business and a weak consumer environment internationally same stores sales growth continues to result from the growing acceptance of delivered pizza around the globe and the successful execution of the concept 

income from operations decreased 95 from 2142 million in 2006 to 1939 million in 2007 and increased 06 in 2008 to 1950 million the decline in income from operations in 2007 was primarily the result of lower profits from the domestic stores and domestic supply chain operations as well as certain recapitalizationrelated expenses the growth in income from operations in 2008 was primarily the result of 142 million of gains on the sale of companyowned stores to franchisees and continued strong performance in our international business additionally the comparison benefits from lower income from operations in 2007 when we incurred higher expenses associated with the company’s recapitalization and a 50 million reserve recorded in 2007 related to certain legal matters in california these increases in 2008 were offset in part by lower margins in our companyowned store and domestic supply chain businesses as well as a decrease in domestic franchise same store sales 

net income declined 643 from 1062 million in 2006 to 379 million in 2007 and increased 425 to 540 million in 2008 the increase in net income in 2008 was primarily due to the comparison to lower net income amounts in the 2007 when we incurred higher expenses associated with the company’s recapitalization and the aforementioned increase in income from operations these recapitalization expenses in 2007 included the writeoff of deferred financing fees and bond discount related to the extinguishment of debt and a 133 million premium paid to repurchase and retire thenoutstanding notes these increases were offset in part by higher ongoing interest expense associated with increased debt under our new capital structure and higher interest income earned in 2007 on funds received in connection with the company’s recapitalization 

we are highly leveraged primarily as a result of our recapitalization in 2007 as of december 28 2008 consolidated longterm debt was 17 billion since 1998 a large portion of our cash flows provided from operations has been used to make principal and interest payments on our indebtedness as well as distributions to shareholders in the form of dividends and stock repurchases our securitized debt requires no scheduled principal payments until anticipated maturity in 2012 overall we believe that our ability to consistently produce significant free cash flows allows us the flexibility not only to service our significant debt but also to invest in our growing business as well as return cash to our shareholders 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america the preparation of these financial statements requires our management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis our management evaluates its estimates including those related to revenue recognition allowance for uncollectible receivables longlived and intangible assets insurance and legal matters and income taxes we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from those estimates changes in our accounting policies and estimates could materially impact our results of operations and financial condition for any particular period we believe that our most critical accounting policies and estimates are 

revenue recognition  we earn revenues through our network of domestic companyowned and franchise stores dough manufacturing and supply chain centers and international operations retail sales from companyowned stores and royalty revenues resulting from the retail sales from franchise stores are recognized as revenues when the items are delivered to or carried out by customers sales of food from our supply chain centers are recognized as revenues upon delivery of the food to franchisees while sales of equipment and supplies are generally recognized as revenues upon shipment of the related products to franchisees 

  

allowance for uncollectible receivables we closely monitor our accounts and notes receivable balances and provide allowances for uncollectible amounts as a result of our reviews these estimates are based on among other factors historical collection experience and a review of our receivables by aging category additionally we may also provide allowances for uncollectible receivables based on specific customer collection issues that we have identified while writeoffs of bad debts have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established management cannot guarantee that future writeoffs will not exceed historical rates specifically if the financial condition of our franchisees were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments additional allowances may be required 

longlived and intangible assets we record longlived assets including property plant and equipment and capitalized software at cost for acquisitions of franchise operations we estimate the fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired based on physical inspection of assets historical experience and other information available to us regarding the acquisition we depreciate and amortize longlived assets using useful lives determined by us based on historical experience and other information available to us we evaluate the potential impairment of longlived assets based on various analyses including the projection of undiscounted cash flows whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable for companyowned stores we perform related impairment tests on an operating market basis which the company has determined to be the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of other cash flows if the carrying amount of a longlived asset exceeds the amount of the expected future undiscounted cash flows of that asset or the estimated fair value of the asset an impairment loss is recognized and the asset is written down to its estimated fair value at december 28 2008 we determined that our longlived assets were not impaired if our future operating performance were to deteriorate we may be required to recognize an impairment charge 

we evaluate goodwill annually for impairment by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value a significant portion of our goodwill relates to acquisitions of domestic franchise stores and is included in our domestic stores segment specifically the companyowned stores reporting unit at december 28 2008 the fair value of our business operations with associated goodwill exceeded their recorded carrying value including the related goodwill however if the future performance of our domestic companyowned stores or domestic supply chain operations were to deteriorate we may be required to recognize a goodwill impairment charge 

insurance and legal matters we are a party to lawsuits and legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business management closely monitors these legal matters and estimates the probable costs for the resolution of such matters these estimates are primarily determined by consulting with both internal and external parties handling the matters and are based upon an analysis of potential results assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies if our estimates relating to legal matters proved inaccurate for any reason we may be required to increase or decrease the related expense in future periods at december 30 2007 and december 28 2008 we had approximately 82 million and 29 million respectively accrued for legal matters 

for certain periods prior to december 1998 and for periods after december 2001 we maintain insurance coverage for workers’ compensation general liability and owned and nonowned auto liability under insurance policies requiring payment of a deductible for each occurrence up to between 500000 and 30 million depending on the policy year and line of coverage the related insurance reserves are based on undiscounted independent actuarial estimates which are based on historical information along with assumptions about future events changes in assumptions for such factors as medical costs and legal actions as well as changes in actual experience could cause these estimates to change in the near term which could result in an increase or decrease in the related expense in future periods at december 30 2007 and december 28 2008 we had approximately 296 million and 304 million respectively accrued for insurance matters 

income taxes our net deferred tax assets assume that we will generate sufficient taxable income in specific tax jurisdictions based on estimates and assumptions the amounts relating to taxes recorded on the balance sheet including tax reserves also consider the ultimate resolution of revenue agent reviews based on estimates and assumptions if these estimates and assumptions change in the future we may be required to adjust our valuation allowance or other tax reserves resulting in additional income tax expense or benefit in future periods

liquidity and capital resources 

as of december 28 2008 we had working capital of 258 million excluding restricted cash and cash equivalents of 789 million and including total unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of 454 million historically we have operated with minimal positive working capital or negative working capital primarily because our receivable collection periods and inventory turn rates are faster than the normal payment terms on our current liabilities we generally collect our receivables within three weeks from the date of the related sale and we generally experience 40 to 50 inventory turns per year in addition our sales are not typically seasonal which further limits our working capital requirements these factors coupled with significant and ongoing cash flows from operations which are primarily used to service our debt obligations invest in our business and repurchase common stock reduce our working capital amounts as of december 28 2008 the company had approximately 420 million of cash held for future interest payments 264 million cash held in interest reserves 100 million cash held for capitalization of certain subsidiaries and 05 million of other restricted cash for a total of 789 million of restricted cash

based upon the current level of operations and anticipated growth we believe that the cash generated from operations and amounts available under the variable funding notes will be adequate to meet our anticipated debt service requirements capital expenditures and working capital needs for the foreseeable future our ability to continue to fund these items and continue to reduce debt could be adversely affected by the occurrence of any of the events described in item 1a risk factors there can be no assurance however that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operations or that future borrowings will be available under the variable funding notes or otherwise to enable us to service our indebtedness or to make anticipated capital expenditures our future operating performance and our ability to service extend or refinance the fixed rate notes and to service extend or refinance the variable funding notes will be subject to future economic conditions and to financial business and other factors many of which are beyond our control 

impact of inflation 

we believe that our results of operations are not materially impacted by moderate changes in the inflation rate inflation and changing prices did not have a material impact on our operations in 2006 2007 or 2008 severe increases in inflation however could affect the global and us economies and could have an adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

new accounting pronouncements 

in september 2006 the fasb issued sfas no 157 “fair value measurements” “sfas 157” sfas 157 defines fair value and provides guidance for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements this statement does not require any new fair value measurements but rather applies to all other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements sfas 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after november 15 2007 the company adopted the provisions of sfas 157 during fiscal 2008 and the applicable disclosures are included in item 8 of this form 10k 

in february 2008 the fasb issued a final staff position to allow a oneyear deferral of adoption of sfas 157 for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a nonrecurring basis the company has elected this oneyear deferral and thus will not apply the provisions of sfas 157 to nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities that are recognized at fair value in the financial statements on a nonrecurring basis until our fiscal year beginning december 29 2008 we generally apply fair value techniques on a nonrecurring basis associated with 1 valuing potential impairment loss related to goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets accounted for pursuant to sfas no 142 and 2 valuing potential impairment loss related to longlived assets accounted for pursuant to sfas no 144 the company is in the process of evaluating the impact of applying sfas 157 to nonfinancial assets and liabilities measured on a nonrecurring basis the fasb also amended sfas 157 to exclude fasb statement no 13 and its related interpretive accounting pronouncements that address leasing transactions 

in february 2007 the fasb issued sfas no 159 “the fair value option for financial assets and liabilities” “sfas 159” this statement permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value if the fair value option is elected unrealized gains and losses will be recognized in earnings at each subsequent reporting date sfas 159 is effective for fiscal years beginning after november 15 2007 on december 31 2007 the company adopted the provisions of sfas 159 and did not elect the fair value option to measure certain financial instruments 

other accounting standards that have been issued by the fasb or other standardssetting bodies that do not require adoption until a future date are not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements upon adoption

our history 

we have been delivering quality affordable pizza to our customers since 1960 when brothers thomas and james monaghan borrowed 900 and purchased a small pizza store in ypsilanti michigan since that time our store count and geographic reach have grown substantially we opened our first franchise store in 1967 our first international store in 1983 and by 1998 we had expanded to over 6200 stores including more than 1700 international stores on six continents during 2005 we opened our 8000 th store worldwide at december 30 2007 we had 8624 stores worldwide in more than 55 countries 

in 1998 an investor group led by investment funds associated with bain capital llc completed a recapitalization through which the investor group acquired a 93 controlling economic interest in our company from thomas monaghan and his family at the time of the recapitalization mr monaghan retired and in march 1999 david a brandon was named our chairman and chief executive officer in 2004 domino’s pizza inc completed its initial public offering the “ipo” and now trades on the new york stock exchange under the ticker symbol “dpz” 

industry overview 

in this document we rely on and refer to information regarding the us quick service restaurant or qsr sector the us qsr pizza category and its components and competitors including us from the crest report prepared by the npd group as well as market research reports analyst reports and other publiclyavailable information although we believe this information to be reliable we have not independently verified it domestic sales information relating to the qsr sector us qsr pizza category and us pizza delivery and carryout represent reported consumer spending obtained by the npd group’s crest report from consumer surveys this information relates to both our companyowned and franchise stores unless otherwise indicated all us industry data included in this document is based on reported consumer spending obtained by the npd group’s crest report from consumer surveys 

the us qsr pizza category is large and fragmented with sales of 339 billion in the twelve months ended november 2007 the us qsr pizza category is the second largest category within the 2242 billion us qsr sector the us qsr pizza category is primarily comprised of delivery dinein and carryout 

we operate primarily within us pizza delivery its 116 billion of sales accounted for 34 of total us qsr pizza category sales in the twelve months ended november 2007 we and our top two competitors account for approximately 46 of us pizza delivery based on reported consumer spending with the remaining 54 attributable to regional chains and individual establishments 

we also compete in carryout which together with pizza delivery are the largest components of the us qsr pizza category us carryout pizza had 133 billion of sales in the twelve months ended november 2007 and while our primary focus is on pizza delivery we are also favorably positioned to compete in carryout given our strong brand convenient store locations and quality affordable menu offerings 

in contrast to the united states international pizza delivery is relatively underdeveloped with only domino’s and one other competitor having a significant multinational presence we believe that demand for international pizza delivery is large and growing driven by international consumers’ increasing emphasis on convenience 

our competitive strengths 

we believe that our competitive strengths include the following 

• strong and proven growth and earnings model over our 47year history we have developed a focused growth and earnings model this model is anchored by strong storelevel economics which provide an entrepreneurial incentive for our franchisees and generate demand for new stores our franchise system in turn has produced strong and consistent earnings for us through royalty payments and supply chain revenues with minimal associated capital expenditures by us 

• strong storelevel economics  we have developed a costefficient store model characterized by a delivery and carryout oriented store design with low capital requirements and a focused menu of quality affordable pizza and complementary side items at the store level we believe that the simplicity and efficiency of our operations give us significant advantages over our competitors who in many cases also focus on dinein 

  

our domestic stores and most of our international stores do not offer dinein areas and thus do not require expensive restaurant facilities and staffing in addition our focused menu of pizza and complementary side items simplifies and streamlines our production and delivery processes and maximizes economies of scale on purchases of our principal ingredients as a result of our focused business model and menu our stores are small averaging approximately 1000 to 1300 square feet and inexpensive to build furnish and maintain as compared to many other qsr franchise opportunities the combination of this efficient store model and strong store sales volume has resulted in strong storelevel financial returns and makes domino’s pizza an attractive business opportunity for existing and prospective franchisees 

• strong and welldiversified franchise system  we have developed a large global diversified and committed franchise network that is a critical component of our systemwide success and our leading position in pizza delivery as of december 30 2007 our franchise store network consisted of 8053 stores 57 of which were located in the contiguous united states in the united states only seven franchisees operate more than 50 stores including our largest domestic franchisee which operates 143 stores our domestic franchisees on average operate between three and four stores we require our domestic franchisees to forego active outside business endeavors aligning their interests with ours and making the success of each domino’s pizza franchise of critical importance to our franchisees 

in addition we generally share 50 of the pretax profits generated by our regional dough manufacturing and supply chain centers with those domestic franchisees who agree to purchase all of their food from our supply chain system these arrangements strengthen our ties with our franchisees by enhancing their profitability while providing us with a continuing source of revenues and earnings this arrangement also provides incentives for franchisees to work closely with us to reduce costs we believe our strong mutuallybeneficial franchisee relationships are evidenced by the over 98 voluntary participation in our domestic supply chain system our over 99 domestic franchise contract renewal rate and our over 99 collection rate on domestic franchise royalty and domestic supply chain receivables 

internationally we have also been able to grow our franchise network by attracting franchisees with business experience and local market knowledge we generally use our master franchise model which provides our international franchisees with exclusive rights to operate stores or subfranchise our wellrecognized domino’s pizza ® brand name in specific agreedupon market areas from yearend 2002 through 2007 we grew our international franchise network 46 from 2382 stores to 3469 stores our largest master franchisee operates 687 stores in five markets which accounts for approximately 20 of our total international store count 

• strong cash flow and earnings stream  a substantial percentage of our earnings are generated by our committed owneroperator franchisees through royalty payments and revenues to our verticallyintegrated supply chain system 

we believe that our store economics have led to a strong well diversified franchise system this established franchise system has produced strong cash flow and earnings for us enabling us to invest in the domino’s pizza ® brand and our stores pay significant dividends repurchase shares of our common stock and deliver attractive returns to our stockholders 

• 1 pizza delivery company in the united states with a leading international presence  we are the number one pizza delivery company in the united states with an 189 share based on reported consumer spending with 5155 stores located in the contiguous united states our domestic store delivery areas cover a majority of us households our share position and scale allow us to leverage our purchasing power supply chain strength and advertising investment across our store base we also believe that our scale and market coverage allow us to effectively serve our customers’ demands for convenience and timely delivery 

outside the united states we have significant share positions in the key markets in which we compete including among other countries mexico where we are the largest qsr company in terms of store count in any qsr category the united kingdom australia south korea canada japan india france and taiwan our top ten international markets based on store count accounted for approximately 81 of our international retail sales in 2007 we believe we have a leading presence in these markets 

• strong brand awareness we believe our domino’s pizza ® brand is one of the most widelyrecognized consumer brands in the world we believe consumers associate our brand with the timely delivery of quality affordable pizza and complementary side items over the past five years our domestic franchise and companyowned stores have invested an estimated 14 billion on national local and cooperative advertising in the united states our domino’s pizza ® brand has been routinely named a megabrand by advertising age  we continue to reinforce our brand with extensive advertising through television radio print and webbased promotions we also enhance the strength of our brand through marketing affiliations with brands such as cocacola ® and nascar ®  

  

we believe that our brand is particularly strong among pizza consumers for whom dinner is a fairly spontaneous event in these situations we believe that service and product quality are the consumers’ priorities we believe that well established demographic and lifestyle trends will drive continuing emphasis on convenience and will therefore continue to play into our brand’s strength 

• internal dough manufacturing and supply chain system in addition to generating significant revenues and earnings we believe that our vertically integrated dough manufacturing and supply chain system enhances the quality and consistency of our products enhances our relationships with franchisees leverages economies of scale to offer lower costs to our stores and allows our store managers to better focus on store operations and customer service by relieving them of the responsibility of mixing dough in the stores 

in 2007 we made approximately 660000 fullservice food deliveries to our domestic stores or between two and three deliveries per store per week with a delivery accuracy rate of approximately 99 all of our companyowned and over 98 of our domestic franchise stores purchase all of their food and supplies from us this is accomplished through our network of 17 regional dough manufacturing and supply chain centers each of which is generally located within a oneday delivery radius of the stores it serves and a leased fleet of over 400 tractors and trailers additionally we supply our domestic and international franchisees with equipment and supplies through our equipment and supply center which we operate as part of our domestic supply chain segment our equipment and supply center sells and delivers a full range of products including ovens and uniforms we also supply certain of our domestic stores with ingredients that are processed at our vegetable processing supply chain center which we operate as part of our domestic supply chain segment 

because we source the food for substantially all of our domestic stores our domestic supply chain segment enables us to leverage and monitor our strong supplier relationships to achieve the cost benefits of scale and to ensure compliance with our rigorous quality standards in addition the “onestop shop” nature of this system combined with our delivery accuracy allows our store managers to eliminate a significant component of the typical “backofstore” activity that many of our competitors’ store managers must undertake 

our business strategy 

we intend to achieve further growth and strengthen our competitive position through the continued implementation of our business strategy which includes the following key elements 

• continue to execute on our mission statement our mission statement is “exceptional franchisees and team members on a mission to be the best pizza delivery company in the world” we implement this mission statement by following a business strategy that

• grow our leading position in an attractive industry us pizza delivery and carryout are the largest components of the us qsr pizza category they are also highly fragmented pizza delivery through which a majority of our retail sales are generated had sales of 116 billion in the twelve months ended november 2007 as the leader in us pizza delivery we believe that our convenient store locations simple operating model widelyrecognized brand and efficient supply chain system are competitive advantages that position us to capitalize on future growth 

carryout had 133 billion of sales in the twelve months ended november 2007 while our primary focus is on pizza delivery we are also favorably positioned as a leader in carryout given our strong brand convenient store locations and quality affordable menu offerings 

  

• leverage our strong brand awareness we believe that the strength of our domino’s pizza ® brand makes us one of the first choices of consumers seeking a convenient quality and affordable meal we intend to continue to promote our brand name and enhance our reputation as the leader in pizza delivery in 2007 we launched a rebranding campaign “you got 30 minutes™” with our new advertising agency crispin porter  bogusky the campaign builds on the company’s 30minute delivery heritage by highlighting the value of what pizza delivery really does for consumers – gives them free time 

in 2006 and 2007 each of our domestic stores contributed 4 of their retail sales to our advertising fund for national advertising in addition to contributions for marketlevel advertising additionally for 2006 and 2007 our domestic stores within active cooperatives elected to allocate an additional 1 of their advertising contributions to support national advertising initiatives 

we intend to leverage our strong brand by continuing to introduce innovative consumertested and profitable new pizza varieties such as domino’s brooklyn style pizza complementary side items such as buffalo wings cheesy bread domino’s buffalo chicken kickers ® and cinna stix ®  and value promotions such as the domino’s 555 deal as well as through marketing affiliations with brands such as cocacola ® and nascar ®  we believe these opportunities when coupled with our scale and share leadership will allow us to grow our position in us pizza delivery 

• expand and optimize our domestic store base we plan to continue expanding our base of domestic stores to take advantage of the attractive growth opportunities in us pizza delivery we believe that our scale allows us to expand our store base with limited marketing distribution and other incremental infrastructure costs additionally our franchiseoriented business model allows us to expand our store base with limited capital expenditures and working capital requirements while we plan to expand our traditional domestic store base primarily through opening new franchise stores we will also continually evaluate our mix of companyowned and franchise stores and strategically acquire franchise stores and refranchise companyowned stores 

• continue to grow our international business we believe that pizza has global appeal and that there is strong and growing international demand for delivered pizza we have successfully built a broad international platform almost exclusively through our master franchise model as evidenced by our 3469 international stores in more than 55 countries we believe that we continue to have significant longterm growth opportunities in international markets where we have established a leading presence in our current top ten international markets we believe that our store base in total for these ten markets is less than half of the total longterm potential store base in those markets generally we believe we will achieve longterm growth internationally as a result of the favorable storelevel economics of our business model the growing international demand for delivered pizza and the strong global recognition of the domino’s pizza ® brand our international stores have produced positive quarterly same store sales growth for 56 consecutive quarters 

store operations 

we believe that our focused and proven store model provides a significant competitive advantage relative to many of our competitors who focus on multiple components of the pizza category particularly dinein we have been focused on pizza delivery for 47 years because our domestic stores and most of our international stores do not offer dinein areas they typically do not require expensive real estate are relatively small and are relatively inexpensive to build and equip our stores also benefit from lower maintenance costs as store assets have long lives and updates are not frequently required our simple and efficient operational processes which we have refined through continuous improvement include 

• strategic store locations to facilitate delivery service 

• productionoriented store designs 

• product and process innovations 

• focused menu 

• efficient order taking production and delivery 

• domino’s pulse™ pointofsale system and 

• comprehensive store audit program 

strategic store locations to facilitate delivery service 

we locate our stores strategically to facilitate timely delivery service to our customers the majority of our domestic stores are located in populated areas in or adjacent to large or midsize cities or on or near college campuses we use geographic information software which incorporates variables such as traffic volumes competitor locations household demographics and visibility to evaluate and identify potential store locations and new markets 

  

productionoriented store designs 

our typical store is relatively small occupying approximately 1000 to 1300 square feet and is designed with a focus on efficient and timely production of consistent quality pizza for delivery the store layout has been refined over time to provide an efficient flow from order taking to delivery our stores are primarily production facilities and accordingly do not typically have a dinein area 

product and process innovations 

our 47 years of experience and innovative culture have resulted in numerous new product and process developments that increase both quality and efficiency these include our efficient verticallyintegrated supply chain system a sturdier corrugated pizza box and a mesh screen that helps cook pizza crust more evenly the domino’s heatwave ® hot bag which was introduced in 1998 keeps our pizzas hot during delivery we also continue to introduce new pizzas such as domino’s brooklyn style pizza which we launched in 2006 additionally we have added a number of complementary side items to our menu such as buffalo wings domino’s buffalo chicken kickers ®  bread sticks cheesy bread and cinna stix ®  

focused menu 

we maintain a focused menu that is designed to present an attractive quality offering to customers while minimizing order errors and expediting the order taking and food preparation processes our basic menu has three choices pizza type pizza size and pizza toppings most of our stores carry two or three sizes of traditional handtossed ultimate deep dish brooklyn style and crunchy thin crust pizza our typical store also offers buffalo wings domino’s buffalo chicken kickers ®  bread sticks cheesy bread cinna stix ® and cocacola ® soft drink products we also occasionally offer other products on a promotional basis such as the oreo ® dessert pizza that was featured during 2007 we believe that our focused menu creates a strong identity among consumers improves operating efficiency and maintains food quality and consistency 

efficient order taking production and delivery 

each store executes an operational process that includes order taking pizza preparation cooking via automated conveyordriven ovens boxing and delivery the entire order taking and pizza production process is designed for completion in approximately 1215 minutes these operational processes are supplemented by an extensive employee training program designed to ensure worldclass quality and customer service it is our priority to ensure that every domino’s store operates in an efficient consistent manner while maintaining our high standards of food quality and team member safety 

domino’s pulse™ pointofsale system 

our computerized management information systems are designed to improve operating efficiencies provide corporate management with timely access to financial and marketing data and reduce store and corporate administrative time and expense we have installed domino’s pulse™ our proprietary pointofsale system in every companyowned store in the united states and a majority of our domestic franchise system some enhanced features of domino’s pulse™ over our previous pointofsale system include 

• touch screen ordering which improves accuracy and facilitates more efficient order taking 

• a delivery driver routing system which improves delivery efficiency 

• improved administrative and reporting capabilities which enable store managers to better focus on store operations and customer satisfaction and 

• enhanced online ordering capability including pizza tracker introduced in 2007 

at december 30 2007 all of our domestic companyowned stores and approximately 59 of our domestic franchise stores have installed domino’s pulse ™  we are requiring our domestic franchisees to install domino’s pulse™ or a pointofsale system that meets similar specifications by june 2008 

comprehensive store audit program 

we utilize a comprehensive store audit program to ensure that our stores are meeting both our stringent standards as well as the expectations of our customers the audit program focuses primarily on the quality of the pizza the store is producing the customer service the store is providing and the condition of the store as viewed by the customer we believe that this store audit program is an integral part of our strategy to maintain high standards in our stores 

  

segment overview 

we operate in three business segments 

• domestic stores our domestic stores segment consists of our domestic franchise operations which oversee our network of 4584 franchise stores located in the contiguous united states and our domestic companyowned store operations which operate our network of 571 companyowned stores located in the contiguous united states 

• domestic supply chain our domestic supply chain segment operates 17 regional dough manufacturing and food supply chain centers one supply chain center providing equipment and supplies to certain of our domestic and international stores and one vegetable processing supply chain center and 

• international our international segment oversees our network of 3469 international franchise stores in more than 55 countries our international segment also distributes food to a limited number of markets from six dough manufacturing and supply chain centers in alaska hawaii and canada four 

domestic stores 

during 2007 our domestic stores segment accounted for 5526 million or 38 of our consolidated revenues our domestic franchises are operated by entrepreneurs who own and operate an average of three to four stores only seven of our domestic franchisees operate more than 50 stores including our largest domestic franchisee which operates 143 stores our principal sources of revenues from domestic store operations are companyowned store sales and royalty payments based on retail sales by our franchisees our domestic network of companyowned stores also plays an important strategic role in our predominantly franchised operating structure in addition to generating revenues and earnings we use our domestic companyowned stores as test sites for new products and promotions as well as store operational improvements and as forums for training new store managers and prospective franchisees we also believe that our domestic companyowned stores add to the economies of scale available for advertising marketing and other costs that are primarily borne by our franchisees while we continue to be primarily a franchised business we continually evaluate our mix of domestic companyowned and franchise stores in an effort to optimize our profitability 

our domestic companyowned store operations are divided into thirteen geographic areas located throughout the contiguous united states while our domestic franchise operations are divided into five regions our team members within these areas provide direct supervision over our domestic companyowned stores provide training store operational audits and marketing services and provide financial analysis and store development services to our franchisees we maintain a close relationship with our franchise stores through regional franchise teams an array of computerbased training materials that help franchise stores comply with our standards and franchise advisory groups that facilitate communications between us and our franchisees 

domestic supply chain 

during 2007 our domestic supply chain segment accounted for 7833 million or 53 of our consolidated revenues our domestic supply chain segment is comprised of dough manufacturing and supply chain centers that manufacture fresh dough on a daily basis and purchase receive store and deliver quality pizzarelated food products and complementary side items to all of our companyowned stores and over 98 of our domestic franchise stores each regional dough manufacturing and supply chain center serves approximately 300 stores generally located within a oneday delivery radius we regularly supply more than 5000 stores with various supplies and ingredients of which seven product groups account for over 90 of the volume our domestic supply chain segment made approximately 660000 fullservice deliveries in 2007 or between two and three deliveries per store per week and we produced nearly 340 million pounds of dough during 2007 

we believe that our franchisees voluntarily choose to obtain food supplies and equipment from us because we provide the most efficient convenient and costeffective alternative while also providing both quality and consistency in addition our domestic supply chain segment offers a profitsharing arrangement to stores that purchase all of their food from our domestic dough manufacturing and supply chain centers this profitsharing arrangement generally provides domestic companyowned stores and participating franchisees with 50 of their regional supply chain center’s pretax profits profits are shared with the franchisees based upon each franchisee’s purchases from our supply chain centers we believe these arrangements strengthen our ties with these franchisees 

  

the information systems used by our domestic dough manufacturing and supply chain centers are an integral part of the quality service we provide our stores we use routing strategies and software to optimize our daily delivery schedules which maximizes ontime deliveries through our strategic dough manufacturing and supply chain center locations and proven routing systems we achieved delivery accuracy rates of approximately 99 during 2007 our supply chain center drivers unload food and supplies and stock store shelves typically during nonpeak store hours which minimizes disruptions in store operations 

international 

during 2007 our international segment accounted for 1269 million or 9 of our consolidated revenues we have 566 franchise stores in mexico representing the largest presence of any qsr company in mexico 467 franchise stores in the united kingdom 405 franchise stores in australia 289 franchise stores in south korea 277 franchise stores in canada and over 100 franchise stores in each of japan india taiwan and france the principal sources of revenues from our international operations are royalty payments generated by retail sales from franchise stores and sales of food and supplies to franchisees in certain markets 

we have grown by more than 1000 international stores over the past five years while our stores are designed for delivery and carryout which are less capitalintensive than dinein we empower our managers and franchisees to adapt the standard operating model within certain parameters to satisfy the local eating habits and consumer preferences of various regions outside the contiguous united states currently most of our international stores are operated under master franchise agreements and we plan to continue entering into master franchise agreements with qualified franchisees to expand our international operations in selected countries we believe that our international franchise stores appeal to potential franchisees because of our wellrecognized brand name the limited capital expenditures required to open and operate our stores and our system’s favorable store economics the following table shows our store count as of december 30 2007 in our top ten international markets which account for 77 of our international stores 

 

 our franchise program 

as of december 30 2007 our 4584 domestic franchise stores were owned and operated by our 1243 domestic franchisees the success of our franchise formula which enables franchisees to benefit from our brand name with a relatively low initial capital investment has attracted a large number of motivated entrepreneurs as franchisees as of december 30 2007 the average domestic franchisee operated approximately three to four stores and had been in our franchise system for twelve years at the same time only seven of our domestic franchisees operated more than 50 stores including our largest domestic franchisee which operates 143 stores 

domestic franchisees 

we apply rigorous standards to prospective franchisees we generally require prospective domestic franchisees to manage a store for at least one year before being granted a franchise this enables us to observe the operational and financial performance of a potential franchisee prior to entering into a longterm contract we also restrict the ability of domestic franchisees to become involved in other businesses which focuses our franchisees’ attention on operating their stores as a result the vast majority of our franchisees come from within the domino’s pizza system we believe these standards are unique to the franchise industry and result in qualified and focused franchisees operating their stores

we enter into franchise agreements with domestic franchisees under which the franchisee is granted the right to operate a store in a particular location for a term of ten years with options to renew for an additional term of ten years we currently have a franchise contract renewal rate of over 99 under the current standard franchise agreement we assign an exclusive area of primary responsibility to each franchise store during the term of the franchise agreement the franchisee is required to pay a 55 royalty fee on sales subject in limited instances to lower rates based on area development agreements sales initiatives and new store incentives we have the contractual right subject to state law to terminate a franchise agreement for a variety of reasons including but not limited to a franchisee’s failure to make required payments when due or failure to adhere to specified company policies and standards 

franchise store development 

we provide domestic franchisees with assistance in selecting store sites and conforming the space to the physical specifications required for a domino’s pizza store each domestic franchisee selects the location and design for each store subject to our approval based on accessibility and visibility of the site and demographic factors including population density and anticipated traffic levels we provide design plans and sell fixtures and equipment to most of our franchise stores 

franchise training and support 

training store managers and employees is a critical component of our success we require all domestic franchisees to complete initial and ongoing training programs provided by us in addition under the standard domestic franchise agreement domestic franchisees are required to implement training programs for their store employees we assist our domestic and international franchisees by making training materials available to them for their use in training store managers and employees including computerbased training materials comprehensive operations manuals and franchise development classes we also maintain communications with our franchisees online through various newsletters and through facetoface meetings 

franchise operations 

we enforce stringent standards over franchise operations to protect the domino’s pizza ® brand all franchisees are required to operate their stores in compliance with written policies standards and specifications which include matters such as menu items ingredients materials supplies services furnishings decor and signs each franchisee has full discretion to determine the prices to be charged to customers we also provide ongoing support to our franchisees including training marketing assistance and consultation to franchisees who experience financial or operational difficulties we have established several advisory boards through which franchisees contribute to developing systemwide initiatives 

international franchisees 

the vast majority of our markets outside of the contiguous united states are operated by master franchisees with franchise and distribution rights for entire regions or countries in select regions or countries we franchise directly to individual store operators our master franchise agreements generally grant the franchisee exclusive rights to develop or subfranchise stores and the right to operate supply chain centers in a particular geographic area for a term of ten to twenty years with options to renew for additional terms the agreements typically contain growth clauses requiring franchisees to open a minimum number of stores within a specified period prospective master franchisees are required to possess or have access to local market knowledge required to establish and develop domino’s pizza stores the local market knowledge focuses on the ability to identify and access targeted real estate sites along with expertise in local customs culture consumer behavior and laws we also seek candidates that have access to sufficient capital to meet their growth and development plans the master franchisee is generally required to pay an initial onetime franchise fee based on the size of the market covered by the master franchise agreement as well as an additional franchise fee upon the opening of each new store in addition the master franchisee is required to pay a continuing royalty fee as a percentage of retail sales which varies among international markets 

  

marketing operations 

our domestic stores generally contribute between 4 to 5 of their retail sales to fund national marketing and advertising campaigns in addition to the required national advertising contributions in those markets where we have cooperative advertising programs our domestic stores also generally contribute for marketlevel media campaigns these national and marketlevel funds are administered by domino’s national advertising fund inc or dnaf our notforprofit advertising subsidiary the funds remitted to dnaf are used primarily to purchase television advertising but also support market research field communications public relations commercial production talent payments and other activities supporting the domino’s pizza ® brand dnaf also provides costeffective print materials to our domestic stores for use in local marketing that reinforce our national branding strategy in addition to the national and marketlevel advertising contributions domestic stores spend additional amounts on local store marketing including targeted database mailings saturation print mailings and community involvement through school and civic organizations 

by communicating a common brand message at the national local market and store levels we create and reinforce a powerful consistent marketing message to consumers this is evidenced by our successful previous marketing campaign with the slogan “get the door it’s domino’s ® ” and our new marketing campaign with the slogan “you got 30 minutes™” over the past five years we estimate that domestic stores have invested approximately 14 billion on national local and cooperative advertising 

internationally marketing efforts are primarily the responsibility of the franchisee in each local market we assist international franchisees with their marketing efforts through marketing workshops and sharing of best practices and successful concepts 

thirdparty suppliers 

we have maintained active relationships of 15 years or more with more than half of our major suppliers our suppliers are required to meet strict quality standards to ensure food safety we review and evaluate our suppliers’ quality assurance programs through among other actions onsite visits third party audits and product evaluations to ensure compliance with our standards we believe that the length and quality of our relationships with suppliers provides us with priority service and quality products at competitive prices 

we believe that two factors have been critical to maintaining longlasting relationships and keeping our purchasing costs low first we are one of the largest domestic volume purchasers of pizzarelated products such as flour cheese sauce and pizza boxes which allows us to maximize leverage with our suppliers when items are put out for bid on a scheduled basis second we use a combination of singlesource and multisource procurement strategies each supply category is evaluated along a number of criteria including value of purchasing leverage consistency of quality and reliability of supply to determine the appropriate number of suppliers 

we currently purchase our mozzarella pizza cheese from a single supplier in 2007 the company entered into a new arrangement with this supplier under this arrangement the supplier agreed to provide an uninterrupted supply of cheese and the company agreed to a five year pricing period during which it agreed to purchase all of its primary pizza cheese for the company’s united states stores from this supplier or alternatively pay to the supplier an amount reflecting any benefit previously received by the company under the new pricing terms the pricing schedule is directly correlated to the cme block cheddar price our chicken is also currently purchased from a single supplier the majority of our meat toppings come from a single supplier under a contract that began in july 2005 and expired in december 2007 we are currently in the process of renegotiating our meat contract the crunchy thin crust dough is currently sourced by another single supplier pursuant to requirements contracts that expire in 2009 we have the right to terminate these arrangements for quality failures and for uncured breaches 

we believe that alternative suppliers for all of these ingredients are available and all of our pizza boxes sauces and other ingredients are sourced from various suppliers while we may incur additional costs if we are required to replace any of our suppliers we do not believe that such additional costs would have a material adverse effect on our business we also entered into a multiyear agreement with cocacola effective january 1 2003 for the contiguous united states the contract provides for cocacola to be our exclusive beverage supplier and expires on the later of december 31 2009 or such time as a minimum number of cases of cocacola ® products are purchased by us we continually evaluate each supply category to determine the optimal sourcing strategy 

we have not experienced any significant shortages of supplies or any delays in receiving our food or beverage inventories restaurant supplies or products prices charged to us by our suppliers are subject to fluctuation and we have historically been able to pass increased costs and savings on to our stores we may periodically enter into financial instruments to manage the risk from changes in commodity prices we do not engage in speculative transactions nor do we hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes 

  

competition 

us and international pizza delivery and carryout are highly competitive domestically we compete against regional and local companies as well as national chains pizza hut ® and papa john’s ®  internationally we compete against pizza hut ® and regional and local companies we generally compete on the basis of product quality location image service and price we also compete on a broader scale with quick service and other international national regional and local restaurants in addition the overall food service industry and the qsr sector in particular are intensely competitive with respect to product quality price service convenience and concept the industry is often affected by changes in consumer tastes economic conditions demographic trends and consumers’ disposable income we compete within the food service industry and the qsr sector not only for customers but also for personnel suitable real estate sites and qualified franchisees 

government regulation 

we are subject to various federal state and local laws affecting the operation of our business as are our franchisees including various health sanitation fire and safety standards each store is subject to licensing and regulation by a number of governmental authorities which include zoning health safety sanitation building and fire agencies in the jurisdiction in which the store is located in connection with the reimaging of our stores we may be required to expend funds to meet certain federal state and local regulations including regulations requiring that remodeled or altered stores be accessible to persons with disabilities difficulties in obtaining or the failure to obtain required licenses or approvals could delay or prevent the opening of a new store in a particular area or cause an existing store to cease operations our supply chain facilities are licensed and subject to similar regulations by federal state and local health and fire codes 

we are also subject to the fair labor standards act and various other federal and state laws governing such matters as minimum wage requirements overtime and other working conditions and citizenship requirements a significant number of our food service personnel are paid at rates related to the applicable minimum wage and past increases in the minimum wage have increased our labor costs as would future increases 

we are subject to the rules and regulations of the federal trade commission and various state laws regulating the offer and sale of franchises the federal trade commission and various state laws require that we furnish a franchise offering circular containing certain information to prospective franchisees and a number of states require registration of the franchise offering circular with state authorities we are operating under exemptions from registration in several states based on the net worth of our operating subsidiary domino’s pizza llc and experience substantive state laws that regulate the franchisorfranchisee relationship presently exist in a substantial number of states and bills have been introduced in congress from time to time that would provide for federal regulation of the franchisorfranchisee relationship the state laws often limit among other things the duration and scope of noncompetition provisions the ability of a franchisor to terminate or refuse to renew a franchise and the ability of a franchisor to designate sources of supply we believe that our uniform franchise offering circular together with any applicable state versions or supplements and franchising procedures comply in all material respects with both the federal trade commission guidelines and all applicable state laws regulating franchising in those states in which we have offered franchises 

internationally our franchise stores are subject to national and local laws and regulations that often are similar to those affecting our domestic stores including laws and regulations concerning franchises labor health sanitation and safety our international stores are also often subject to tariffs and regulations on imported commodities and equipment and laws regulating foreign investment we believe that our international disclosure statements franchise offering documents and franchising procedures comply in all material respects with the laws of the foreign countries in which we have offered franchises 

trademarks 

we have many registered trademarks and service marks and believe that the domino’s ® mark and domino’s pizza ® names and logos in particular have significant value and are important to our business our policy is to pursue registration of our trademarks and to vigorously oppose the infringement of any of our trademarks we license the use of our registered marks to franchisees through franchise agreements 

environmental matters 

we are not aware of any federal state or local environmental laws or regulations that will materially affect our earnings or competitive position or result in material capital expenditures however we cannot predict the effect of possible future environmental legislation or regulations during 2007 there were no material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities and no such material expenditures are anticipated in 2008 

  

employees 

as of december 30 2007 we had approximately 12500 employees who we refer to as team members in our companyowned stores supply chain centers world resource center our corporate headquarters and regional offices as franchisees are independent business owners they and their employees are not included in our employee count we consider our relationship with our employees and franchisees to be good we estimate the total number of people who work in the domino’s pizza system including our employees franchisees and the employees of franchisees was over 170000 as of december 30 2007 

none of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement 

safety 

our commitment to safety is embodied in our hiring training and review process before an applicant is considered for hire as a delivery driver in the united states motor vehicle records are reviewed to ensure a minimum safe driving record of one or two years in addition we require regular checks of driving records and proof of insurance for delivery drivers throughout their employment with us each domestic domino’s driver including drivers employed by franchisees are required to complete our safe delivery training program we have also implemented several safe driving incentive programs 

our safety and security department oversees security matters for our domestic companyowned stores and provides assistance to our franchisees as requested regional security and safety directors oversee security measures at domestic companyowned store locations and assist local authorities in investigations of incidents involving our stores or personnel 

community activities 

we believe in supporting the communities we serve and we base our corporate giving on three simple elements delivering charitable support to our own team members to our customers and to national programs 

national philanthropic partner 

we have a tradition of creating multiyear partnerships with a national charity to raise funds and public awareness for the organization our current national philanthropic partner is st jude children’s research hospital st jude is internationally recognized for its pioneering work in finding cures and saving children with cancer and other catastrophic diseases through a variety of internal and consumerbased activities including a national fundraising campaign called thanks and giving the domino’s pizza system has contributed more than 38 million to st jude in the first four years of the partnership in addition to raising funds the domino’s pizza system has supported st jude through inkind donations including hosting hospitalwide pizza parties for patients and their families the domino’s pizza system also helps st jude build awareness through the inclusion of the st jude logo on millions of our pizza boxes and through a link on our consumer web site

research and development

 item 1a risk factors 

risks relating to our business and industry 

the pizza category is highly competitive and such competition could adversely affect our operating results 

we compete in the united states against two national chains as well as many regional and local businesses we could experience increased competition from existing or new companies in the pizza category which could create increasing pressures to grow our business in order to maintain our market share if we are unable to maintain our competitive position we could experience downward pressure on prices lower demand for our products reduced margins the inability to take advantage of new business opportunities and the loss of market share all of which would have an adverse effect on our operating results and could cause our stock price to decline 

we also compete on a broader scale with quick service and other international national regional and local restaurants the overall food service market and the quick service restaurant sector are intensely competitive with respect to food quality price service image convenience and concept and are often affected by changes in 

• consumer tastes 

• national regional or local economic conditions 

• disposable purchasing power 

• demographic trends and 

• currency fluctuations to the extent international operations are involved 

we compete within the food service market and the quick service restaurant sector not only for customers but also for management and hourly employees suitable real estate sites and qualified franchisees our domestic supply chain segment is also subject to competition from outside suppliers if other suppliers who meet our qualification standards were to offer lower prices or better service to our franchisees for their ingredients and supplies and as a result our franchisees chose not to purchase from our domestic supply chain centers our financial condition business and results of operations would be adversely affected 

  

if we fail to successfully implement our growth strategy which includes opening new domestic and international stores our ability to increase our revenues and operating profits could be adversely affected 

a significant component of our growth strategy is opening new domestic and international stores we and our franchisees face many challenges in opening new stores including among others 

• selection and availability of suitable store locations 

• negotiation of acceptable lease or financing terms 

• securing required domestic or foreign governmental permits and approvals and 

• employment and training of qualified personnel 

the opening of additional franchise stores also depends in part upon the availability of prospective franchisees who meet our criteria our failure to add a significant number of new stores would adversely affect our ability to increase revenues and operating income 

we are currently planning to expand our international operations in markets where we currently operate and in selected new markets this may require considerable management time as well as startup expenses for market development before any significant revenues and earnings are generated operations in new foreign markets may achieve low margins or may be unprofitable and expansion in existing markets may by affected by local economic and market conditions therefore as we expand internationally we may not experience the operating margins we expect our results of operations may be negatively impacted and our common stock price may decline 

we may also pursue strategic acquisitions as part of our business if we are able to identify acquisition candidates such acquisitions may be financed to the extent permitted under our debt agreements with substantial debt or with potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities 

the food service market is affected by consumer preferences and perceptions changes in these preferences and perceptions may lessen the demand for our products which would reduce sales and harm our business 

food service businesses are affected by changes in consumer tastes national regional and local economic conditions and demographic trends for instance if prevailing health or dietary preferences cause consumers to avoid pizza and other products we offer in favor of foods that are perceived as more healthy our business and operating results would be harmed moreover because we are primarily dependent on a single product if consumer demand for pizza should decrease our business would suffer more than if we had a more diversified menu as many other food service businesses do 

increases in food labor and other costs could adversely affect our profitability and operating results 

an increase in our operating costs could adversely affect our profitability factors such as inflation increased food costs increased labor and employee benefit costs and increased energy costs may adversely affect our operating costs most of the factors affecting costs are beyond our control and in many cases we may not be able to pass along these increased costs to our customers or franchisees most ingredients used in our pizza particularly cheese are subject to significant price fluctuations as a result of seasonality weather demand and other factors the cheese block price per pound averaged 172 in 2007 and the estimated increase in companyowned store food costs from a hypothetical 025 adverse change in the average cheese block price per pound would have been approximately 25 million in 2007 labor costs are largely a function of the minimum wage for a majority of our store personnel and certain supply chain center personnel and generally are a function of the availability of labor food including cheese costs and labor represent approximately 50 to 60 of a typical companyowned store’s cost of sales 

our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our business and limit our ability to plan for or respond to changes in our business 

as a result of the 2007 recapitalization we hold a substantial amount of indebtedness and are highly leveraged as of december 30 2007 our consolidated longterm indebtedness was 17 billion we may also incur additional debt which would not be prohibited under the terms of the securitized debt our substantial indebtedness and the fact that a large portion of our cash flow from operations must be used to make payments on our indebtedness could have important consequences to our business and our shareholders for example they could 

 

   

in addition the financial and other covenants we agreed to with our lenders will limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness make investments pay dividends and engage in other transactions and the leverage may cause potential lenders to be less willing to loan funds to us in the future our failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default that if not cured or waived could result in the acceleration of repayment of all of our indebtedness 

we may be unable to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our significant debt service obligations which would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

our ability to make principal and interest payments on and to refinance our indebtedness will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future this to a certain extent is subject to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control if our business does not generate sufficient cash flow from operations if currently anticipated cost savings and operating improvements are not realized on schedule in the amounts projected or at all or if future borrowings are not available to us under our variable funding notes in amounts sufficient to fund our other liquidity needs our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected if we cannot generate sufficient cash flow from operations to make scheduled principal and interest payments on our debt obligations in the future we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity sell assets delay capital expenditures or seek additional equity if we are unable to refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all or to effect any other action relating to our indebtedness on satisfactory terms or at all our business may be harmed 

the terms of our securitized debt financing of certain of our whollyowned subsidiaries have restrictive terms and our failure to comply with any of these terms could put us in default which would have an adverse effect on our business and prospects 

unless and until we repay all outstanding borrowings under our securitized debt we will remain subject to the restrictive terms of these borrowings the securitized debt under which certain of our whollyowned subsidiaries issued and guaranteed senior and subordinated fixed rate notes and variable funding senior revolving notes contain a number of significant covenants including a debt service coverage calculation these covenants limit the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to among other things 

• sell assets 

• alter the business we conduct 

• engage in mergers acquisitions and other business combinations 

• declare dividends or redeem or repurchase capital stock 

• incur assume or permit to exist additional indebtedness or guarantees 

• make loans and investments 

• incur liens and 

• enter into transactions with affiliates 

the securitized debt also requires us to maintain a specified financial ratio at the end of each fiscal quarter these restrictions could affect our ability to pay dividends or repurchase shares of our common stock our ability to meet this financial ratio can be affected by events beyond our control and we may not satisfy such a test a breach of this covenant could result in a rapid amortization event or default under the securitized debt if amounts owed under the securitized debt are accelerated because of a default under the securitized debt and we are unable to pay such amounts the insurers have the right to assume control of substantially all of the securitized assets 

we expect that during the first five years following issuance the senior notes will accrue interest at a fixed rate of 5261 per year and the subordinated notes will accrue interest at a fixed rate of 7629 if we do not exercise either of our two oneyear extension options following the fiveyear interest only period our securitized debt will be subject to principal amortization and may also be subject to an increased interest rate if it is not repaid or refinanced if we do exercise one or both extensions then we may be subject to an increased interest rate 

if we are unable to refinance or repay amounts under the securitized debt prior to the expiration of the fiveyear interestonly term six or sevenyear interestonly term if we satisfy certain conditions and exercise one or both of our oneyear extension elections our cash flow would be directed to the repayment of the securitized debt and other than a weekly servicing fee sufficient to cover minimal selling general and administrative expenses would not be available for operating our business 

no assurance can be given that any refinancing or additional financing will be possible when needed or that we will be able to negotiate acceptable terms in addition our access to capital is affected by prevailing conditions in the financial and capital markets and other factors beyond our control there can be no assurance that market conditions will be favorable at the times that we require new or additional financing 

  

the indenture governing the securitized debt will restrict the cash flow from the entities subject to the securitization to any of our other entities and upon the occurrence of certain events cash flow would be further restricted 

in the event that a rapid amortization event occurs under the indenture including without limitation upon an event of default under the indenture or the failure to repay the securitized debt at the end of the five year interestonly period or at the end of any extension period the funds available to us will be reduced or eliminated which would in turn reduce our ability to operate or grow our business 

we do not have longterm contracts with many of our suppliers and as a result they could seek to significantly increase prices or fail to deliver 

we typically do not have written contracts or formal longterm arrangements with many of our suppliers although in the past we have not experienced significant problems with our suppliers our suppliers may implement significant price increases or may not meet our requirements in a timely fashion if at all the occurrence of any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

shortages or interruptions in the supply or delivery of fresh food products could adversely affect our operating results 

we and our franchisees are dependent on frequent deliveries of fresh food products that meet our specifications shortages or interruptions in the supply of fresh food products caused by unanticipated demand problems in production or distribution inclement weather or other conditions could adversely affect the availability quality and cost of ingredients which would adversely affect our operating results 

any prolonged disruption in the operations of any of our dough manufacturing and supply chain centers could harm our business 

we operate 17 regional dough manufacturing and supply chain centers and one vegetable processing supply chain center in the contiguous united states and dough manufacturing and a total of six supply chain centers in alaska hawaii and canada our domestic dough manufacturing and supply chain centers service all of our companyowned stores and over 98 of our domestic franchise stores as a result any prolonged disruption in the operations of any of these facilities whether due to technical or labor difficulties destruction or damage to the facility real estate issues or other reasons could adversely affect our business and operating results 

we face risks of litigation from customers franchisees employees and others in the ordinary course of business which diverts our financial and management resources any adverse litigation or publicity may negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations 

claims of illness or injury relating to food quality or food handling are common in the food service industry in addition class action lawsuits have been filed and may continue to be filed against various quick service restaurants alleging among other things that quick service restaurants have failed to disclose the health risks associated with highfat foods and that quick service restaurant marketing practices have encouraged obesity in addition to decreasing our sales and profitability and diverting our management resources adverse publicity or a substantial judgment against us could negatively impact our financial condition results of operations and brand reputation hindering our ability to attract and retain franchisees and grow our business 

further we may be subject to employee franchisee and other claims in the future based on among other things discrimination harassment wrongful termination and wage rest break and meal break issues including those relating to overtime compensation we have been subject to these types of claims in the past and we currently have reached a conditional settlement to a purported class action claim of this type in california relating to rest break and meal break compensation if one or more of these claims were to be successful or if there is a significant increase in the number of these claims our business financial condition and operating results could be harmed 

loss of key personnel or our inability to attract and retain new qualified personnel could hurt our business and inhibit our ability to operate and grow successfully 

our success in the highly competitive business of pizza delivery will continue to depend to a significant extent on our leadership team and other key management personnel other than with our chairman and chief executive officer david a brandon we do not have longterm employment agreements with any of our executive officers as a result we may not be able to retain our executive officers and key personnel or attract additional qualified management our success also will continue to depend on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel to operate our stores dough manufacturing and supply chain centers and international operations the loss of these employees or our inability to recruit and retain qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 

  

our international operations subject us to additional risk such risks and costs may differ in each country in which we do business and may cause our profitability to decline due to increased costs 

we conduct a portion of our business outside the united states our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected if global markets in which our franchise stores compete are affected by changes in political economic or other factors these factors over which neither we nor our franchisees have control may include 

• recessionary or expansive trends in international markets 

• changing labor conditions and difficulties in staffing and managing our foreign operations 

• increases in the taxes we pay and other changes in applicable tax laws 

• legal and regulatory changes and the burdens and costs of our compliance with a variety of foreign laws 

• changes in inflation rates 

• changes in exchange rates and the imposition of restrictions on currency conversion or the transfer of funds 

• difficulty in collecting our royalties and longer payment cycles 

• expropriation of private enterprises 

• political and economic instability and 

• other external factors 

fluctuations in the value of the us dollar in relation to other currencies may lead to lower revenues and earnings 

exchange rate fluctuations could have an adverse effect on our results of operations approximately 86 86 and 87 of our total revenues were derived from our international segment in 2005 2006 and 2007 respectively a majority of which were denominated in foreign currencies sales made by our stores outside the united states are denominated in the currency of the country in which the store is located and this currency could become less valuable prior to conversion to us dollars as a result of exchange rate fluctuations unfavorable currency fluctuations could lead to increased prices to customers outside the united states or lower profitability to our franchisees outside the united states or could result in lower revenues for us on a us dollar basis from such customers and franchisees 

we may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property which could harm the value of our brand and branded products and adversely affect our business 

we depend in large part on our brand and branded products and believe that they are very important to our business we rely on a combination of trademarks copyrights service marks trade secrets and similar intellectual property rights to protect our brand and branded products the success of our business depends on our continued ability to use our existing trademarks and service marks in order to increase brand awareness and further develop our branded products in both domestic and international markets we have registered certain trademarks and have other trademark registrations pending in the united states and foreign jurisdictions not all of the trademarks that we currently use have been registered in all of the countries in which we do business and they may never be registered in all of these countries we may not be able to adequately protect our trademarks and our use of these trademarks may result in liability for trademark infringement trademark dilution or unfair competition all of the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property in the united states and in foreign countries may not be adequate in addition the laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states further through acquisitions of third parties we may acquire brands and related trademarks that are subject to the same risks as the brands and trademarks we currently own 

we may from time to time be required to institute litigation to enforce our trademarks or other intellectual property rights or to protect our trade secrets such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could negatively affect our sales profitability and prospects regardless of whether we are able to successfully enforce our rights 

  

our earnings and business growth strategy depends on the success of our franchisees and we may be harmed by actions taken by our franchisees that are outside of our control 

a significant portion of our earnings comes from royalties generated by our franchise stores franchisees are independent operators and their employees are not our employees we provide limited training and support to franchisees but the quality of franchise store operations may be diminished by any number of factors beyond our control consequently franchisees may not successfully operate stores in a manner consistent with our standards and requirements or may not hire and train qualified managers and other store personnel if they do not our image and reputation may suffer and our revenues and stock price could decline while we try to ensure that our franchisees maintain the quality of our brand and branded products our franchisees may take actions that adversely affect the value of our intellectual property or reputation as of december 30 2007 we had 1243 domestic franchisees operating 4584 domestic stores seven of these franchisees each operate over 50 domestic stores including our largest domestic franchisee which operates 143 stores and the average franchisee operates three to four stores in addition our international master franchisees are generally responsible for the development of significantly more stores than our domestic franchisees as a result our international operations are more closely tied to the success of a smaller number of franchisees than our domestic operations our largest international master franchisee operates 687 stores in five markets which accounts for approximately 20 of our total international store count our domestic and international franchisees may not operate their franchises successfully if one or more of our key franchisees were to become insolvent or otherwise were unable or unwilling to pay us our royalties our business and results of operations would be adversely affected

we are also subject to a federal trade commission rule and to various state and foreign laws that govern the offer and sale of franchises additionally these laws regulate various aspects of the franchise relationship including terminations and the refusal to renew franchises the failure to comply with these laws and regulations in any jurisdiction or to obtain required government approvals could result in a ban or temporary suspension on future franchise sales fines or other penalties or require us to make offers of rescission or restitution any of which could adversely affect our business and operating results 

our current insurance coverage may not be adequate insurance premiums for such coverage may increase and we may not be able to obtain insurance at acceptable rates or at all 

we have retention programs for workers’ compensation general liability and owned and nonowned automobile liabilities we are generally responsible for up to 10 million per occurrence under these retention programs for workers’ compensation and general liability we are also generally responsible for between 500000 and 30 million per occurrence under these retention programs for owned and nonowned automobile liabilities total insurance limits under these retention programs vary depending upon the period covered and range up to 1100 million per occurrence for general liability and owned and nonowned automobile liabilities and up to the applicable statutory limits for workers’ compensation these insurance policies may not be adequate to protect us from liabilities that we incur in our business in addition in the future our insurance premiums may increase and we may not be able to obtain similar levels of insurance on reasonable terms or at all any such inadequacy of or inability to obtain insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations we are not required to and do not specifically set aside funds for our retention programs

investment funds associated with bain capital llc together beneficially own approximately 28 of our outstanding common stock in addition two of our directors are representatives of investment funds associated with bain capital llc as a result these investment funds associated with bain capital llc have significant influence over our decision to enter into any corporate transaction and may have the ability to prevent any transaction that requires the approval of stockholders regardless of whether or not other stockholders believe that such transaction is in their own best interests such concentration of voting power could have the effect of delaying deterring or preventing a change of control or other business combination that might otherwise be beneficial to our stockholders

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

overview 

our fiscal year typically includes 52 weeks comprised of three twelve week quarters and one sixteen week quarter fiscal 2005 fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2007 each consisted of 52 weeks 

we are the number one pizza delivery company in the united states with an 189 share of the pizza delivery market based on reported consumer spending we also have a leading international presence we operate through a network of 571 companyowned stores all of which are in the united states and 8053 franchise stores located in all 50 states and in more than 55 countries in addition we operate 17 regional dough manufacturing and supply chain centers in the contiguous united states as well as six dough manufacturing and supply chain centers outside the contiguous united states 

our financial results are driven largely by retail sales at our companyowned and franchise stores changes in retail sales are driven by changes in same store sales and store counts we monitor both of these metrics very closely as they directly impact our revenues and profits and strive to consistently increase the related amounts retail sales drive companyowned store revenues royalty payments from franchisees and domestic supply chain revenues retail sales are primarily impacted by the strength of the domino’s pizza ® brand the success of our marketing promotions and our ability to execute our store operating model and other business strategies 

we devote significant attention to our brandbuilding efforts which is evident in our system’s estimated 14 billion of domestic advertising spending over the past five years and our frequent designation as a megabrand by advertising age  we plan on continuing to build our brand and retail sales by satisfying customers worldwide with our pizza delivery offerings and by continuing to invest significant amounts in the advertising and marketing of the domino’s pizza ® brand 

we also pay particular attention to the store economics or the investment performance of a store to its owner of both our companyowned and franchise stores we believe that our system’s favorable store economics benefit from the relatively small initial and ongoing investments required to own and operate a domino’s pizza store we believe these favorable investment requirements coupled with a strong brand message supported by significant advertising spending as well as highquality and focused menu offerings drive strong store economics which in turn drive demand for new stores 

in 2007 global retail sales which are total retail sales at companyowned and franchise stores worldwide increased 66 as compared to 2006 this increase in global retail sales was driven by strong international same store sales growth as well as growth in worldwide store counts offset in part by a decrease in domestic franchise same store sales in 2006 global retail sales increased 20 as compared to 2005 this increase in global retail sales was driven by strong international same store sales growth as well as growth in worldwide store counts 

revenues decreased 743 million or 49 in 2006 and increased 256 million or 18 in 2007 the decline in 2006 was due primarily to lower volumes in our domestic supply chain operations and lower food prices primarily cheese and lower companyowned store and international revenues the increase in revenues in 2007 was largely due to higher domestic supply chain revenues due primarily to higher food prices including cheese worldwide store counts have increased from 7757 at the beginning of 2005 to 8624 at the end of 2007 this growth in store counts can be attributed to the growing global acceptance of our brand and our pizza delivery concept as well as the economics inherent in our system which attracts new franchisees and encourages existing franchisees to grow their business domestic same store sales increased 49 in 2005 and decreased 41 and 17 in 2006 and 2007 respectively international same store sales increased 61 40 and 67 during the same periods the company’s domestic same store sales results in 2006 and 2007 reflected a weak consumer environment and the underperformance of our product and promotional offerings during those years internationally same stores sales growth continues to result from the growing acceptance of delivered pizza around the globe and the successful execution of the concept 

  

income from operations increased 76 from 1991 million in 2005 to 2142 million in 2006 and decreased 95 in 2007 to 1939 million the growth in income from operations in 2006 was primarily the result of increases in global retail sales and related profits from domestic supply chain operations as well as decreases in general and administrative expenses the decline in income from operations in 2007 was primarily the result of lower profits from the domestic stores and domestic supply chain operations as well as certain recapitalizationrelated expenses net income declined 19 from 1083 million in 2005 to 1062 million in 2006 and declined 643 from 2006 to 379 million in 2007 the decline in net income in 2007 was primarily due to a 754 million increase in interest expense in 2007 due primarily to higher average outstanding debt balances offset in part by lower average borrowing rates both the result of the company’s recapitalization and the aforementioned decrease in income from operations net income was also negatively impacted in 2007 by 133 million of other expense related to the premium paid to repurchase and retire the senior subordinated notes that were tendered in the debt tender offer in connection with the 2007 recapitalization 

we are highly leveraged primarily as the result of recapitalizations in 1998 2003 and 2007 as of december 30 2007 consolidated longterm debt was 17 billion since 1998 a large portion of our cash flows provided from operations has been used to make principal and interest payments on our indebtedness as well as distributions to shareholders in the form of dividends and stock repurchases our securitized debt requires no principal payments until anticipated maturity in 2012 overall we believe that our ability to consistently produce significant free cash flows allows us the flexibility not only to service our significant debt but also to invest in our growing business as well as return cash to our shareholders 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america the preparation of these financial statements requires our management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis our management evaluates its estimates including those related to revenue recognition allowance for uncollectible receivables longlived and intangible assets insurance and legal matters and income taxes we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from those estimates changes in our accounting policies and estimates could materially impact our results of operations and financial condition for any particular period we believe that our most critical accounting policies and estimates are 

revenue recognition  we earn revenues through our network of domestic companyowned and franchise stores dough manufacturing and supply chain centers and international operations retail sales from companyowned stores and royalty revenues resulting from the retail sales from franchise stores are recognized as revenues when the items are delivered to or carried out by customers sales of food from our supply chain centers are recognized as revenues upon delivery of the food to franchisees while sales of equipment and supplies are generally recognized as revenues upon shipment of the related products to franchisees 

allowance for uncollectible receivables we closely monitor our accounts and notes receivable balances and provide allowances for uncollectible amounts as a result of our reviews these estimates are based on among other factors historical collection experience and a review of our receivables by aging category additionally we may also provide allowances for uncollectible receivables based on specific customer collection issues that we have identified while writeoffs of bad debts have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established management cannot guarantee that future writeoffs will not exceed historical rates specifically if the financial condition of our franchisees were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments additional allowances may be required 

longlived and intangible assets we record longlived assets including property plant and equipment and capitalized software at cost for acquisitions of franchise operations we estimate the fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired based on physical inspection of assets historical experience and other information available to us regarding the acquisition we depreciate and amortize longlived assets using useful lives determined by us based on historical experience and other information available to us we review longlived assets for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that the related amounts might be impaired when required we perform related impairment tests on a marketlevel basis for companyowned stores at december 30 2007 we determined that our longlived assets were not impaired however if our future operating performance were to deteriorate we may be required to recognize an impairment charge 

  

we evaluate goodwill annually for impairment by comparing the fair value of our reporting units to their carrying values a significant portion of our goodwill relates to acquisitions of domestic franchise stores and is included in our domestic stores segment at december 30 2007 the fair value of our business operations with associated goodwill exceeded their recorded carrying value including the related goodwill however if the future performance of our domestic companyowned stores or domestic supply chain operations were to deteriorate we may be required to recognize a goodwill impairment charge 

insurance and legal matters we are a party to lawsuits and legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business management closely monitors these legal matters and estimates the probable costs for the resolution of such matters these estimates are primarily determined by consulting with both internal and external parties handling the matters and are based upon an analysis of potential results assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies if our estimates relating to legal matters proved inaccurate for any reason we may be required to increase or decrease the related expense in future periods 

for certain periods prior to december 1998 and for periods after december 2001 we maintain insurance coverage for workers’ compensation general liability and owned and nonowned auto liability under insurance policies requiring payment of a deductible for each occurrence up to between 500000 and 30 million depending on the policy year and line of coverage the related insurance reserves are based on undiscounted independent actuarial estimates which are based on historical information along with assumptions about future events changes in assumptions for such factors as medical costs and legal actions as well as changes in actual experience could cause these estimates to change in the near term which could result in an increase or decrease in the related expense in future periods 

income taxes our net deferred tax assets assume that we will generate sufficient taxable income in specific tax jurisdictions based on estimates and assumptions the amounts relating to taxes recorded on the balance sheet including tax reserves also consider the ultimate resolution of revenue agent reviews based on estimates and assumptions if these estimates and assumptions change in the future we may be required to adjust our valuation allowance or other tax reserves resulting in additional income tax expense or benefit in future periods

the consolidated operating margin which we define as revenues less cost of sales decreased 56 million or 15 in 2007 as summarized in the following table 

 

 the 56 million decrease in consolidated operating margin was due primarily to lower margins at our companyowned stores and domestic supply chain operations offset in part by higher margins in our international business

domestic companyowned stores the domestic companyowned store operating margin decreased 44 million or 54 in 2007 as summarized in the following table

as a percentage of store revenues labor costs increased 07 percentage points to 308 in 2007 due primarily to higher average wage rates during 2007 

domestic supply chain the domestic supply chain operating margin decreased 87 million or 107 in 2007 as summarized in the following table 

 

 the 87 million decrease in the domestic supply chain operating margin was due primarily to lower volumes offset in part by lower labor costs 

  

as a percentage of domestic supply chain revenues the domestic supply chain operating margin decreased primarily as a result of higher food prices primarily cheese and to a lesser extent wheat and lower volumes as a result of lower domestic franchise same store sales these decreases were offset in part by lower variable labor costs increases in certain food prices including cheese have a negative effect on the domestic supply chain operating margin due to the fixed dollar margin earned by domestic supply chain on certain food items including cheese had the 2007 cheese prices been in effect during 2006 the domestic supply chain operating margin as a percentage of domestic supply chain revenues would have been approximately 100 for 2006 resulting in a domestic supply chain operating margin decrease of 08 percentage points in 2007 

general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses increased 146 million or 86 in 2007 as a percentage of total revenues general and administrative expenses increased 07 percentage points to 126 in 2007 these increases were due primarily to a 50 million reserve recorded in 2007 related to certain legal matters in california and general and administrative expenses recorded in connection with the company’s recapitalization

domestic supply chain revenues from domestic supply operations decreased 563 million or 69 in 2006 this decrease was due primarily to decreases in cheese prices as well as lower volumes related to decreases in domestic franchise same store sales cheese prices negatively impacted revenues by approximately 356 million in 2006 

international revenues from international operations decreased 62 million or 48 in 2006 this decrease was due primarily to the sale of companyowned operations in france and the netherlands and were offset in part by higher royalty revenues due to increases in same store sales and the average number of international stores open during 2006 on a constant dollar basis same store sales increased 40 in 2006 compared to 2005 on a historical dollar basis same store sales increased 46 in 2006 compared to 2005 reflecting a generally weaker us dollar in those markets in which we compete there were 2987 and 3223 international stores in operation as of january 1 2006 and december 31 2006 respectively 

cost of sales  operating margin  the consolidated operating margin which we define as revenues less cost of sales decreased 08 million or 02 in 2006 as summarized in the following table 

 

 the 08 million decrease in consolidated operating margin was due primarily to lower margins at our companyowned stores and lower domestic franchise royalty revenues offset in part by higher margins in our international business and improved margins in our domestic supply chain operations franchise revenues do not have a cost of sales component and as a result changes in franchise revenues have a disproportionate effect on the consolidated operating margin 

as a percentage of total revenues our consolidated operating margin increased primarily as a result of a market decrease in overall food prices primarily cheese which benefited both domestic companyowned store and domestic supply chain operating margins as a percentage of revenues as well as improvements in the operating margins in our international operations these increases were offset in part by lower domestic same store sales which generated lower domestic franchise royalty revenues lower domestic supply chain volumes and lower domestic companyowned store revenues changes in the operating margin at our domestic companyowned store operations and our domestic supply chain operations are more fully described below 

  

domestic companyowned stores the domestic companyowned store operating margin decreased 06 million or 08 in 2006 as summarized in the following table

as a percentage of domestic supply chain revenues the domestic supply chain operating margin increased primarily as a result lower food prices primarily cheese offset in part by lower volumes as a result of lower domestic franchise same store sales decreases in certain food prices including cheese have a positive effect on the domestic supply chain operating margin due to the fixed dollar margin earned by domestic supply chain on certain food items including cheese had the 2006 cheese prices been in effect during 2005 the domestic supply chain operating margin as a percentage of domestic supply chain revenues would have been approximately 102 for 2005 resulting in a domestic supply chain operating margin increase of 04 percentage points in 2006 

general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses decreased 159 million or 85 in 2006 as a percentage of total revenues general and administrative expenses decreased 04 percentage points to 119 in 2006 these decreases were due primarily to a gain of approximately 28 million recognized on the sale of companyowned operations in france and the netherlands in 2006 a reduction of general and administrative expenses of approximately 54 million resulting from the absence of these operations during the second half of 2006 and the positive impact in 2006 related to the 28 million of charges incurred in the fourth quarter of 2005 related to a goodwill impairment charge and losses on store sales additionally general and administrative expenses were positively impacted by decreases in variable general and administrative expenses including lower administrative labor 

interest expense interest expense increased 62 million or 128 in 2006 this increase in interest expense was due primarily to higher effective borrowing rates during 2006 and higher average outstanding debt balances in 2006 our average outstanding borrowings increased 33 million to 7575 million in 2006 our effective borrowing rate increased 07 percentage points to 65 in 2006 compared to 2005 total deferred financing fee and bond discount expense was 30 million and 34 million in 2005 and 2006 respectively

overview 

domino’s pizza inc referred to as the “company” “domino’s” or in the first person notations of “we” “us” and “our” is the number one pizza delivery company in the united states based on reported consumer spending and has a leading presence internationally we pioneered the pizza delivery business and have built the domino’s pizza ® brand into one of the most widelyrecognized consumer brands in the world together with our franchisees we have supported the domino’s pizza ® brand with an estimated 14 billion in domestic advertising spending over the past five years we operate through a network of 8366 companyowned and franchise stores located in all 50 states and in more than 50 countries in addition we operate 17 regional dough manufacturing and distribution centers in the contiguous united states and six dough manufacturing and distribution centers outside the contiguous united states the foundation of our systemwide success and leading market position is our strong relationships with our franchisees comprised of over 2000 owneroperators dedicated to the success of our company and the domino’s pizza ® brand 

over our 46year history we have developed a simple business model focused on our core strength of delivering quality pizza in a timely manner this business model includes a deliveryoriented store design with low capital requirements a focused menu of pizza and complementary side items committed owneroperator franchisees and a verticallyintegrated distribution system our earnings are driven largely from retail sales at our franchise stores which generate royalty payments and distribution revenues to us we also generate earnings through retail sales at our companyowned stores 

we operate our business in three segments domestic stores domestic distribution and international 

• domestic stores the domestic stores segment which is comprised of 4572 franchise stores and 571 companyowned stores generated revenues of 5511 million and income from operations of 1432 million during 2006 

• domestic distribution our domestic distribution segment which manufactures dough and distributes food and supplies to all of our companyowned stores and over 98 of our domestic franchise stores generated revenues of 7628 million and income from operations of 573 million during 2006 

• international our international segment oversees 3223 franchise stores outside the contiguous united states it also manufactures dough and distributes food and supplies in a limited number of these markets during 2006 our international segment generated revenues of 1234 million of which approximately 45 resulted from the collection of franchise royalties and fees and generated income from operations of 524 million of which approximately 92 resulted from the collection of franchise royalties and fees 

on a consolidated basis we generated revenues of more than 14 billion and income from operations after deducting 386 million of unallocated corporate and other expenses of 2142 million in 2006 net income was 1062 million in 2006 we have been able to increase our income from operations more than 68 over the past five years through strong domestic and international same store sales growth the addition of nearly 1300 stores worldwide during that time and strong performance by our distribution business this growth was achieved with capital expenditures by us of approximately 20 million to 30 million on an annualized basis since a significant portion of our earnings are derived from retail sales by our franchisees 

on february 7 2007 we announced a recapitalization plan which comprises i a tender offer to purchase up to 13850000 shares of our common stock which is expected to expire on march 9 2007 the “equity tender offer” ii a tender offer and consent solicitation for any and all of our outstanding 8 14  senior subordinated notes due 2011 which is expected to expire on march 9 2007 the “debt tender offer” iii the repayment of all outstanding borrowings and related accrued interest under our current senior secured credit facility and the termination of that facility and iv new borrowings of up to 185 billion in securitized debt although we are currently negotiating the terms and availability of this securitized debt we anticipate that we will obtain the funds required to finance the repayment of our existing borrowings under our senior secured credit facility the equity tender offer and the debt tender offer as well as to pay all related fees and expenses from a bridge loan facility we expect to enter into with a syndicate of banks financial institutions and other entities that is expected to provide for borrowings of up to 135 billion the “bridge loan facility” we have obtained a commitment subject to customary conditions from a syndicate of banks to provide the bridge loan facility 

  

in this annual report on form 10k we refer to the foregoing transactions as the “recapitalization” in addition following the recapitalization we expect subject to the approval of our board of directors to pay a significant special cash dividend to our shareholders and our board of directors will consider authorizing future open market repurchases of our common stock any such special dividend payment and open market repurchases are expected to use substantially all of any remaining proceeds of the securitized debt and no proceeds other than under the securitized variable funding senior notes are expected to be used for working capital or other general corporate purposes in the event that a special cash dividend is paid we have approved a separate dividend equivalent rights policy to i allow holders of vested stock options or options that vest in calendar year 2007 including our directors executive officers and certain team members to receive a cash payment in respect of such options equal to the amount of the dividend that would be paid on the shares underlying the options and ii allow holders of unvested stock options to have the option exercise price reduced to the extent permitted by applicable law to reflect the amount of the dividend 

our history 

we have been delivering quality affordable pizza to our customers since 1960 when brothers thomas and james monaghan borrowed 900 and purchased a small pizza store in ypsilanti michigan since that time our store count and geographic reach have grown substantially we opened our first franchise store in 1967 our first international store in 1983 and by 1998 we had expanded to over 6200 stores including more than 1700 international stores on six continents during 2005 we opened our 8000 th store worldwide 

in 1998 an investor group led by investment funds associated with bain capital llc completed a recapitalization through which the investor group acquired a 93 controlling economic interest in our company from thomas monaghan and his family at the time of the recapitalization mr monaghan retired and in march 1999 david a brandon was named our chairman and chief executive officer in 2004 domino’s pizza inc completed its initial public offering the “ipo” and now trades on the new york stock exchange under the ticker symbol “dpz” 

industry overview 

in this document we rely on and refer to information regarding the us quick service restaurant or qsr sector the us qsr pizza category and its components and competitors including us from the crest report prepared by the npd group as well as market research reports analyst reports and other publiclyavailable information although we believe this information to be reliable we have not independently verified it domestic sales information relating to the qsr sector us qsr pizza category and us pizza delivery and carryout represent reported consumer spending obtained by the npd group’s crest report from consumer surveys this information relates to both our companyowned and franchise stores unless otherwise indicated all us industry data included in this document is based on reported consumer spending obtained by the npd group’s crest report from consumer surveys 

the us qsr pizza category is large growing and highly fragmented with sales of 342 billion in the twelve months ended november 2006 the us qsr pizza category is the second largest category within the 2166 billion us qsr sector the us qsr pizza category is primarily comprised of delivery dinein and carryout 

we operate primarily within us pizza delivery its 121 billion of sales accounted for 35 of total us qsr pizza category sales in the twelve months ended november 2006 total pizza delivery sales grew by 27 during that period we believe that this growth is the result of wellestablished demographic and lifestyle trends driving increased consumer emphasis on convenience we and our top two competitors account for approximately 46 of us pizza delivery based on reported consumer spending with the remaining 54 attributable to regional chains and individual establishments 

we also compete in carryout which together with pizza delivery are the largest components of the us qsr pizza category us carryout pizza had 136 billion of sales in the twelve months ended november 2006 and while our primary focus is on pizza delivery we are also favorably positioned to compete in carryout given our strong brand convenient store locations and quality affordable menu offerings 

in contrast to the united states international pizza delivery is relatively underdeveloped with only domino’s and one other competitor having a significant multinational presence we believe that demand for international pizza delivery is large and growing driven by international consumers’ increasing emphasis on convenience 

  

our competitive strengths 

we believe that our competitive strengths include the following 

• strong and proven growth and earnings model over our 46year history we have developed a focused growth and earnings model this model is anchored by strong storelevel economics which provide an entrepreneurial incentive for our franchisees and generate demand for new stores our franchise system in turn has produced strong and consistent earnings for us through royalty payments and distribution revenues with minimal associated capital expenditures by us 

• strong storelevel economics  we have developed a costefficient store model characterized by a delivery and carryout oriented store design with low capital requirements and a focused menu of quality affordable pizza and complementary side items at the store level we believe that the simplicity and efficiency of our operations give us significant advantages over our competitors who in many cases also focus on dinein 

our domestic stores and most of our international stores do not offer dinein areas and thus do not require expensive restaurant facilities and staffing in addition our focused menu of pizza and complementary side items simplifies and streamlines our production and delivery processes and maximizes economies of scale on purchases of our principal ingredients as a result of our focused business model and menu our stores are small averaging approximately 1000 to 1300 square feet and inexpensive to build furnish and maintain as compared to many other qsr franchise opportunities the combination of this efficient store model and strong store sales volume has resulted in strong storelevel financial returns and makes domino’s pizza an attractive business opportunity for existing and prospective franchisees 

• strong and welldiversified franchise system  we have developed a large global diversified and committed franchise network that is a critical component of our systemwide success and our leading position in pizza delivery as of december 31 2006 our franchise store network consisted of 7795 stores 59 of which were located in the contiguous united states in the united states only five franchisees operate more than 50 stores including our largest domestic franchisee which operates 140 stores our domestic franchisees on average operate between three and four stores we require our domestic franchisees to forego active outside business endeavors aligning their interests with ours and making the success of each domino’s pizza franchise of critical importance to our franchisees 

in addition we generally share 50 of the pretax profits generated by our regional dough manufacturing and distribution centers with those domestic franchisees who agree to purchase all of their food from our distribution system these arrangements strengthen our ties with our franchisees by enhancing their profitability while providing us with a continuing source of revenues and earnings this arrangement also provides incentives for franchisees to work closely with us to reduce costs we believe our strong mutuallybeneficial franchisee relationships are evidenced by the over 98 voluntary participation in our domestic distribution system our over 99 domestic franchise contract renewal rate and our over 99 collection rate on domestic franchise royalty and domestic distribution receivables 

internationally we have also been able to grow our franchise network by attracting franchisees with business experience and local market knowledge we generally use our master franchise model which provides our international franchisees with exclusive rights to operate stores or subfranchise our wellrecognized domino’s pizza ® brand name in specific agreedupon market areas from yearend 2001 through 2006 we grew our international franchise network 43 from 2259 stores to 3223 stores our largest master franchisee operates 620 stores in five markets which accounts for approximately 19 of our total international store count 

• strong cash flow and earnings stream  a substantial percentage of our earnings are generated by our committed owneroperator franchisees through royalty payments and revenues to our verticallyintegrated distribution system 

we believe that our store economics have led to a strong welldiversified franchise system this established franchise system has produced strong cash flow and earnings for us enabling us to invest in the domino’s pizza ® brand and our stores pay significant dividends repurchase shares of our common stock and deliver attractive returns to our stockholders 

  

• 1 pizza delivery company in the united states with a leading international presence  we are the number one pizza delivery company in the united states with a 190 share based on reported consumer spending with 5143 stores located in the contiguous united states our domestic store delivery areas cover a majority of us households our share position and scale allow us to leverage our purchasing power distribution strength and advertising investment across our store base we also believe that our scale and market coverage allow us to effectively serve our customers’ demands for convenience and timely delivery 

outside the united states we have significant share positions in the key markets in which we compete including among other countries mexico where we are the largest qsr company in terms of store count in any qsr category the united kingdom australia south korea canada japan taiwan and india our top ten international markets based on store count accounted for approximately 81 of our international retail sales in 2006 we believe we have a leading presence in these markets 

• strong brand awareness we believe our domino’s pizza ® brand is one of the most widelyrecognized consumer brands in the world we believe consumers associate our brand with the timely delivery of quality affordable pizza and complementary side items over the past five years our domestic franchise and companyowned stores have invested an estimated 14 billion on national local and cooperative advertising in the united states our domino’s pizza ® brand has been routinely named a megabrand by advertising age  we continue to reinforce our brand with extensive advertising through television radio print and webbased promotions we also enhance the strength of our brand through marketing affiliations with brands such as cocacola ® and nascar ®  

according to industry research reports measuring unaided consumer brand awareness over 80 of pizza consumers in the us are aware of the domino’s pizza ® brand we believe that our brand is particularly strong among pizza consumers for whom dinner is a fairly spontaneous event in these situations we believe that service and product quality are the consumers’ priorities we believe that wellestablished demographic and lifestyle trends will drive continuing emphasis on convenience and will therefore continue to play into our brand’s strength 

• our internal dough manufacturing and distribution system in addition to generating significant revenues and earnings we believe that our verticallyintegrated dough manufacturing and distribution system enhances the quality and consistency of our products enhances our relationships with franchisees leverages economies of scale to offer lower costs to our stores and allows our store managers to better focus on store operations and customer service by relieving them of the responsibility of mixing dough in the stores 

in 2006 we made approximately 650000 fullservice food deliveries to our domestic stores or between two and three deliveries per store per week with a delivery accuracy rate of approximately 99 all of our companyowned and over 98 of our domestic franchise stores purchase all of their food and supplies from us this is accomplished through our network of 17 regional dough manufacturing and distribution centers each of which is generally located within a oneday delivery radius of the stores it serves and a leased fleet of over 200 tractors and trailers additionally we supply our domestic and international franchisees with equipment and supplies through our equipment and supply distribution center which we operate as part of our domestic distribution segment our equipment and supply distribution center sells and delivers a full range of products including ovens and uniforms we also supply certain of our domestic stores with ingredients that are processed at our vegetable processing distribution center which we operate as part of our domestic distribution segment 

because we source the food for substantially all of our domestic stores our domestic distribution segment enables us to leverage and monitor our strong supplier relationships to achieve the cost benefits of scale and to ensure compliance with our rigorous quality standards in addition the “onestop shop” nature of this system combined with our delivery accuracy allows our store managers to eliminate a significant component of the typical “backofstore” activity that many of our competitors’ store managers must undertake 

  

our business strategy 

we intend to achieve further growth and strengthen our competitive position through the continued implementation of our business strategy which includes the following key elements 

• continue to execute on our mission statement our mission statement is “exceptional franchisees and team members on a mission to be the best pizza delivery company in the world” we implement this mission statement by following a business strategy that

• grow our leading position in an attractive industry us pizza delivery and carryout are the largest components of the us qsr pizza category they are also highly fragmented pizza delivery through which a majority of our retail sales are generated had sales of 121 billion in the twelve months ended november 2006 and grew 27 during that period as the leader in us pizza delivery we believe that our convenient store locations simple operating model widelyrecognized brand and efficient distribution system are competitive advantages that position us to capitalize on future growth 

carryout had 136 billion of sales in the twelve months ended november 2006 and grew 19 during that period while our primary focus is on pizza delivery we are also favorably positioned as a leader in carryout given our strong brand convenient store locations and quality affordable menu offerings 

• leverage our strong brand awareness we believe that the strength of our domino’s pizza ® brand makes us one of the first choices of consumers seeking a convenient quality and affordable meal we intend to continue to promote our brand name and enhance our reputation as the leader in pizza delivery for example we intend to continue to promote our successful advertising campaign “get the door it’s domino’s ® ” through national local and cooperative media in 2005 each of our domestic stores contributed 4 of their retail sales to our advertising fund for national advertising in addition to contributions for marketlevel advertising additionally for 2006 our domestic stores within active cooperatives elected to allocate an additional 1 of their advertising contributions to support national advertising initiatives 

we intend to leverage our strong brand by continuing to introduce innovative consumertested and profitable new pizza varieties such as domino’s brooklyn style pizza complementary side items such as buffalo wings cheesy bread domino’s buffalo chicken kickers ® and cinna stix ®  and value promotions such as the domino’s 555 deal as well as through marketing affiliations with brands such as cocacola ® and nascar ®  we believe these opportunities when coupled with our scale and share leadership will allow us to grow our position in us pizza delivery 

• expand and optimize our domestic store base we plan to continue expanding our base of domestic stores to take advantage of the attractive growth opportunities in us pizza delivery we believe that our scale allows us to expand our store base with limited marketing distribution and other incremental infrastructure costs additionally our franchiseoriented business model allows us to expand our store base with limited capital expenditures and working capital requirements while we plan to expand our traditional domestic store base primarily through opening new franchise stores we will also continually evaluate our mix of companyowned and franchise stores and strategically acquire franchise stores and refranchise companyowned stores 

  

• continue to grow our international business we believe that pizza has global appeal and that there is strong and growing international demand for delivered pizza we have successfully built a broad international platform almost exclusively through our master franchise model as evidenced by our 3223 international stores in more than 50 countries we believe that we continue to have significant longterm growth opportunities in international markets where we have established a leading presence in our current top ten international markets we believe that our store base is less than half of the total longterm potential store base in those markets generally we believe we will achieve longterm growth internationally as a result of the favorable storelevel economics of our business model the growing international demand for delivered pizza and the strong global recognition of the domino’s pizza ® brand our international stores have produced positive quarterly same store sales growth for 52 consecutive quarters 

store operations 

we believe that our focused and proven store model provides a significant competitive advantage relative to many of our competitors who focus on multiple components of the pizza category particularly dinein we have been focused on pizza delivery for 46 years because our domestic stores and most of our international stores do not offer dinein areas they typically do not require expensive real estate are relatively small and are relatively inexpensive to build and equip our stores also benefit from lower maintenance costs as store assets have long lives and updates are not frequently required our simple and efficient operational processes which we have refined through continuous improvement include 

• strategic store locations to facilitate delivery service 

• productionoriented store designs 

• product and process innovations 

• a focused menu 

• efficient order taking production and delivery 

• domino’s pulse™ pointofsale system and 

• a comprehensive store audit program 

strategic store locations to facilitate delivery service 

we locate our stores strategically to facilitate timely delivery service to our customers the majority of our domestic stores are located in populated areas in or adjacent to large or midsize cities or on or near college campuses we use geographic information software which incorporates variables such as traffic volumes competitor locations household demographics and visibility to evaluate and identify potential store locations and new markets 

productionoriented store designs 

our typical store is relatively small occupying approximately 1000 to 1300 square feet and is designed with a focus on efficient and timely production of consistent quality pizza for delivery the store layout has been refined over time to provide an efficient flow from order taking to delivery our stores are primarily production facilities and accordingly do not typically have a dinein area 

product and process innovations 

our 46 years of experience and innovative culture have resulted in numerous new product and process developments that increase both quality and efficiency these include our efficient verticallyintegrated distribution system a sturdier corrugated pizza box and a mesh screen that helps cook pizza crust more evenly the domino’s heatwave ® hot bag which was introduced in 1998 keeps our pizzas hot during delivery we also continue to introduce new pizzas on a limited time only basis such as domino’s brooklyn style pizza that we launched in 2006 additionally we have added a number of complementary side items to our menu such as buffalo wings domino’s buffalo chicken kickers ®  bread sticks cheesy bread and cinna stix ®  

focused menu 

we maintain a focused menu that is designed to present an attractive quality offering to customers while minimizing order errors and expediting the order taking and food preparation processes our basic menu has three choices pizza type pizza size and pizza toppings most of our stores carry two sizes of traditional handtossed ultimate deep dish and crunchy thin crust pizza our typical store also offers buffalo wings domino’s buffalo chicken kickers ®  bread sticks cheesy bread cinna stix ® and cocacola ® soft drink products we also occasionally offer other products on a promotional basis such as the domino’s ovenbaked brownie squares that were featured during 2006 we believe that our focused menu creates a strong identity among consumers improves operating efficiency and maintains food quality and consistency 

  

efficient order taking production and delivery 

each store executes an operational process that includes order taking pizza preparation cooking via automated conveyordriven ovens boxing and delivery the entire order taking and pizza production process is designed for completion in approximately 1215 minutes these operational processes are supplemented by an extensive employee training program designed to ensure worldclass quality and customer service it is our priority to ensure that every domino’s store operates in an efficient consistent manner while maintaining our high standards of food quality and team member safety 

domino’s pulse ™ pointofsale system 

our computerized management information systems are designed to improve operating efficiencies provide corporate management with timely access to financial and marketing data and reduce store and corporate administrative time and expense we have installed domino’s pulse ™  our proprietary pointofsale system in every companyowned store in the united states some enhanced features of domino’s pulse ™ over our previous pointofsale system include 

• touch screen ordering which improves accuracy and facilitates more efficient order taking 

• a delivery driver routing system which improves delivery efficiency 

• improved administrative and reporting capabilities which enable store managers to better focus on store operations and customer satisfaction and 

• enhanced online ordering capability 

at december 31 2006 all of our domestic companyowned stores and approximately 39 of our domestic franchise stores have domino’s pulse ™ installed we are requiring our domestic franchisees to install domino’s pulse ™ by june 2008 

comprehensive store audit program 

we utilize a comprehensive store audit program to ensure that our stores are meeting both our stringent standards as well as the expectations of our customers the audit program focuses primarily on the quality of the pizza the store is producing the customer service the store is providing and the condition of the store as viewed by the customer we believe that this store audit program is an integral part of our strategy to maintain high standards in our stores 

segment overview 

we operate in three business segments 

• domestic stores our domestic stores segment consists of our domestic franchise operations which oversee our network of 4572 franchise stores located in the contiguous united states and our domestic companyowned store operations which operate our network of 571 companyowned stores located in the contiguous united states 

• domestic distribution our domestic distribution segment operates 17 regional dough manufacturing and food distribution centers one distribution center providing equipment and supplies to certain of our domestic and international stores and one vegetable processing distribution center and 

• international our international segment oversees our network of 3223 international franchise stores in more than 50 countries our international segment also distributes food to a limited number of markets from six dough manufacturing and distribution centers in alaska hawaii and canada four 

domestic stores 

during 2006 our domestic stores segment accounted for 5511 million or 38 of our consolidated revenues our domestic franchises are operated by entrepreneurs who own and operate an average of three to four stores only five of our domestic franchisees operate more than 50 stores including our largest domestic franchisee which operates 140 stores our principal sources of revenues from domestic store operations are companyowned store sales and royalty payments based on retail sales by our franchisees our domestic network of companyowned stores also plays an important strategic role in our predominantly franchised operating structure in addition to generating revenues and earnings we use our domestic companyowned stores as test sites for new products and promotions as well as store operational improvements and as forums for training new store managers and prospective franchisees we also believe that our domestic companyowned stores add to the economies of scale available for advertising marketing and other costs that are primarily borne by our franchisees while we continue to be primarily a franchised business we continually evaluate our mix of domestic companyowned and franchise stores in an effort to optimize our profitability 

  

our domestic companyowned store operations are divided into thirteen geographic areas located throughout the contiguous united states while our domestic franchise operations are divided into five regions our team members within these areas provide direct supervision over our domestic companyowned stores provide training store operational audits and marketing services and provide financial analysis and store development services to our franchisees we maintain a close relationship with our franchise stores through regional franchise teams an array of computerbased training materials that help franchise stores comply with our standards and franchise advisory groups that facilitate communications between us and our franchisees 

domestic distribution 

during 2006 our domestic distribution segment accounted for 7628 million or 53 of our consolidated revenues our domestic distribution segment is comprised of dough manufacturing and distribution centers that manufacture fresh dough on a daily basis and purchase receive store and deliver quality pizzarelated food products and complementary side items to all of our companyowned stores and over 98 of our domestic franchise stores each regional dough manufacturing and distribution center serves approximately 300 stores generally located within a oneday delivery radius we regularly supply more than 5000 stores with various supplies and ingredients of which nine product groups account for nearly 90 of the volume our domestic distribution segment made approximately 650000 fullservice deliveries in 2006 or between two and three deliveries per store per week and we produced nearly 365 million pounds of dough during 2006 

we believe that our franchisees voluntarily choose to obtain food supplies and equipment from us because we provide the most efficient convenient and costeffective alternative while also providing both quality and consistency in addition our domestic distribution segment offers a profitsharing arrangement to stores that purchase all of their food from our domestic dough manufacturing and distribution centers this profitsharing arrangement generally provides domestic companyowned stores and participating franchisees with 50 of their regional distribution center’s pretax profits profits are shared with the franchisees based upon each franchisee’s purchases from our distribution centers we believe these arrangements strengthen our ties with these franchisees 

the information systems used by our domestic dough manufacturing and distribution centers are an integral part of the quality service we provide our stores we use routing strategies and software to optimize our daily delivery schedules which maximizes ontime deliveries through our strategic dough manufacturing and distribution center locations and proven routing systems we achieved ontime delivery rates of approximately 99 during 2006 our distribution center drivers unload food and supplies and stock store shelves typically during nonpeak store hours which minimizes disruptions in store operations 

international 

during 2006 our international segment accounted for 1234 million or 9 of our consolidated revenues we have 548 franchise stores in mexico representing the largest presence of any qsr company in mexico 422 franchise stores in the united kingdom 395 franchise stores in australia 287 franchise stores in south korea 272 franchise stores in canada and over 100 franchise stores in each of japan india and taiwan the principal sources of revenues from our international operations are royalty payments generated by retail sales from franchise stores sales of food and supplies to franchisees in certain markets 

we have grown by more than 900 international stores over the past five years while our stores are designed for delivery and carryout which are less capitalintensive than dinein we empower our managers and franchisees to adapt the standard operating model within certain parameters to satisfy the local eating habits and consumer preferences of various regions outside the contiguous united states currently most of our international stores are operated under master franchise agreements and we plan to continue entering into master franchise agreements with qualified franchisees to expand our international operations in selected countries we believe that our international franchise stores appeal to potential franchisees because of our wellrecognized brand name the limited capital expenditures required to open and operate our stores and our system’s favorable store economics the following table shows our store count as of december 31 2006 in our top ten international markets which account for 78 of our international stores 

  

 our franchise program 

as of december 31 2006 our 4572 domestic franchise stores were owned and operated by our 1259 domestic franchisees the success of our franchise formula which enables franchisees to benefit from our brand name with a relatively low initial capital investment has attracted a large number of motivated entrepreneurs as franchisees as of december 31 2006 the average domestic franchisee operated approximately three to four stores and had been in our franchise system for eleven years at the same time only five of our domestic franchisees operated more than 50 stores including our largest domestic franchisee which operates 140 stores

we apply rigorous standards to prospective franchisees we generally require prospective domestic franchisees to manage a store for at least one year before being granted a franchise this enables us to observe the operational and financial performance of a potential franchisee prior to entering into a longterm contract we also restrict the ability of domestic franchisees to become involved in other businesses which focuses our franchisees’ attention on operating their stores as a result the vast majority of our franchisees come from within the domino’s pizza system we believe these standards are unique to the franchise industry and result in qualified and focused franchisees operating their stores 

franchise agreements 

we enter into franchise agreements with domestic franchisees under which the franchisee is granted the right to operate a store in a particular location for a term of ten years with options to renew for an additional term of ten years we currently have a franchise contract renewal rate of over 99 under the current standard franchise agreement we assign an exclusive area of primary responsibility to each franchise store during the term of the franchise agreement the franchisee is required to pay a 55 royalty fee on sales subject in limited instances to lower rates based on area development agreements sales initiatives and new store incentives we have the contractual right subject to state law to terminate a franchise agreement for a variety of reasons including but not limited to a franchisee’s failure to make required payments when due or failure to adhere to specified company policies and standards 

franchise store development 

we provide domestic franchisees with assistance in selecting store sites and conforming the space to the physical specifications required for a domino’s pizza store each domestic franchisee selects the location and design for each store subject to our approval based on accessibility and visibility of the site and demographic factors including population density and anticipated traffic levels we provide design plans and sell fixtures and equipment for most of our franchise stores 

franchise training and support 

training store managers and employees is a critical component of our success we require all domestic franchisees to complete initial and ongoing training programs provided by us in addition under the standard domestic franchise agreement domestic franchisees are required to implement training programs for their store employees we assist our domestic and international franchisees by making training materials available to them for their use in training store managers and employees including computerbased training materials comprehensive operations manuals and franchise development classes we also maintain communications with our franchisees online through various newsletters and through facetoface meetings 

  

franchise operations 

we enforce stringent standards over franchise operations to protect the domino’s pizza ® brand name all franchisees are required to operate their stores in compliance with written policies standards and specifications which include matters such as menu items ingredients materials supplies services furnishings decor and signs each franchisee has full discretion to determine the prices to be charged to customers we also provide ongoing support to our franchisees including training marketing assistance and consultation to franchisees who experience financial or operational difficulties we have established several advisory boards through which franchisees contribute to developing systemwide initiatives 

international franchisees 

the vast majority of our markets outside of the contiguous united states are operated by master franchisees with franchise and distribution rights for entire regions or countries in select regions or countries we franchise directly to individual store operators our master franchise agreements generally grant the franchisee exclusive rights to develop or subfranchise stores and the right to operate distribution centers in a particular geographic area for a term of ten to 20 years with options to renew for additional terms the agreements typically contain growth clauses requiring franchisees to open a minimum number of stores within a specified period prospective master franchisees are required to possess or have access to local market knowledge required to establish and develop domino’s pizza stores the local market knowledge focuses on the ability to identify and access targeted real estate sites along with expertise in local customs culture consumer behavior and laws we also seek candidates that have access to sufficient capital to meet their growth and development plans the master franchisee is generally required to pay an initial onetime franchise fee based on the size of the market covered by the master franchise agreement as well as an additional franchise fee upon the opening of each new store in addition the master franchisee is required to pay a continuing royalty fee as a percentage of retail sales which varies among international markets 

marketing operations 

our domestic stores generally contribute 5 of their retail sales to fund national marketing and advertising campaigns in addition to the required national advertising contributions in those markets where we have cooperative advertising programs our domestic stores also generally contribute for market level media campaigns these national and marketlevel funds are administered by domino’s national advertising fund inc or dnaf our notforprofit advertising subsidiary the funds remitted to dnaf are used primarily to purchase television advertising but also support market research field communications public relations commercial production talent payments and other activities supporting the domino’s pizza ® brand dnaf also provides costeffective print materials to our domestic stores for use in local marketing that reinforce our national branding strategy in addition to the national and market level advertising contributions domestic stores spend additional amounts on local store marketing including targeted database mailings saturation print mailings and community involvement through school and civic organizations 

by communicating a common brand message at the national local market and store levels we create and reinforce a powerful consistent marketing message to consumers this is evidenced by our successful marketing campaign with the slogan “get the door it’s domino’s ® ” over the past five years we estimate that domestic stores have invested approximately 14 billion on national local and cooperative advertising 

internationally marketing efforts are primarily the responsibility of the franchisee in each local market we assist international franchisees with their marketing efforts through marketing workshops and sharing of best practices and successful concepts 

suppliers 

we have maintained active relationships of 15 years or more with more than half of our major suppliers our suppliers are required to meet strict quality standards to ensure food safety we review and evaluate our suppliers’ quality assurance programs through among other actions onsite visits third party audits and product evaluations to ensure compliance with our standards we believe that the length and quality of our relationships with suppliers provides us with priority service and quality products at competitive prices 

we believe that two factors have been critical to maintaining longlasting relationships and keeping our purchasing costs low first we are one of the largest domestic volume purchasers of pizzarelated products such as flour cheese sauce and pizza boxes which allows us to maximize leverage with our suppliers when items are put out for bid on a scheduled basis second we use a combination of singlesource and multisource procurement strategies each supply category is evaluated along a number of criteria including value of purchasing leverage consistency of quality and reliability of supply to determine the appropriate number of suppliers 

  

we currently purchase our mozzarella pizza cheese from a single supplier pursuant to a requirements contract that provides for pricing based on volume our cheese cost is based on the market price of cheese plus a supplier margin the supplier margin will be reduced as certain volume purchase levels are reached once a volume purchase level is reached the supplier margin is reduced and can only be further reduced in the future based upon attainment of higher volume purchase levels the supplier agreement is terminable by us upon 90 days prior written notice our chicken is also currently purchased from a single supplier the majority of our meat toppings come from another single supplier under a contract that began in july 2005 and will expire in december 2007 the crunchy thin crust dough is currently sourced by another single supplier pursuant to requirements contracts that expire in 2009 we have the right to terminate these requirements contracts for quality failures and for uncured breaches 

we believe that alternative suppliers for all of these ingredients are available and all of our pizza boxes sauces and other ingredients are sourced from various suppliers while we may incur additional costs if we are required to replace any of our suppliers we do not believe that such additional costs would have a material adverse effect on our business we also entered into a multiyear agreement with cocacola effective january 1 2003 for the contiguous united states the contract provides for cocacola to be our exclusive beverage supplier and expires on the later of december 31 2009 or such time as a minimum number of cases of cocacola ® products are purchased by us we continually evaluate each supply category to determine the optimal sourcing strategy 

we have not experienced any significant shortages of supplies or any delays in receiving our food or beverage inventories restaurant supplies or products prices charged to us by our suppliers are subject to fluctuation and we have historically been able to pass increased costs and savings on to our stores we may periodically enter into financial instruments to manage the risk from changes in commodity prices we do not engage in speculative transactions nor do we hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes 

competition 

us and international pizza delivery and carryout are highly competitive domestically we compete against regional and local companies as well as national chains pizza hut ® and papa john’s ®  internationally we compete against pizza hut ® and regional and local companies we generally compete on the basis of product quality location delivery time service and price we also compete on a broader scale with quick service and other international national regional and local restaurants in addition the overall food service industry and the qsr sector in particular are intensely competitive with respect to product quality price service convenience and concept the industry is often affected by changes in consumer tastes economic conditions demographic trends and consumers’ disposable income we compete within the food service industry and the qsr sector not only for customers but also for personnel suitable real estate sites and qualified franchisees 

government regulation 

we are subject to various federal state and local laws affecting the operation of our business as are our franchisees including various health sanitation fire and safety standards each store is subject to licensing and regulation by a number of governmental authorities which include zoning health safety sanitation building and fire agencies in the jurisdiction in which the store is located in connection with the reimaging of our stores we may be required to expend funds to meet certain federal state and local regulations including regulations requiring that remodeled or altered stores be accessible to persons with disabilities difficulties in obtaining or the failure to obtain required licenses or approvals could delay or prevent the opening of a new store in a particular area or cause an existing store to cease operations our distribution facilities are licensed and subject to similar regulations by federal state and local health and fire codes 

we are also subject to the fair labor standards act and various other federal and state laws governing such matters as minimum wage requirements overtime and other working conditions and citizenship requirements a significant number of our food service personnel are paid at rates related to the applicable minimum wage and past increases in the minimum wage have increased our labor costs as would future increases 

  

we are subject to the rules and regulations of the federal trade commission and various state laws regulating the offer and sale of franchises the federal trade commission and various state laws require that we furnish a franchise offering circular containing certain information to prospective franchisees and a number of states require registration of the franchise offering circular with state authorities we are operating under exemptions from registration in several states based on the net worth of our operating subsidiary domino’s pizza llc and experience substantive state laws that regulate the franchisorfranchisee relationship presently exist in a substantial number of states and bills have been introduced in congress from time to time that would provide for federal regulation of the franchisorfranchisee relationship the state laws often limit among other things the duration and scope of noncompetition provisions the ability of a franchisor to terminate or refuse to renew a franchise and the ability of a franchisor to designate sources of supply we believe that our uniform franchise offering circular together with any applicable state versions or supplements and franchising procedures comply in all material respects with both the federal trade commission guidelines and all applicable state laws regulating franchising in those states in which we have offered franchises 

internationally our franchise stores are subject to national and local laws and regulations that often are similar to those affecting our domestic stores including laws and regulations concerning franchises labor health sanitation and safety our international stores are also often subject to tariffs and regulations on imported commodities and equipment and laws regulating foreign investment we believe that our international disclosure statements franchise offering documents and franchising procedures comply in all material respects with the laws of the foreign countries in which we have offered franchises 

trademarks 

we have many registered trademarks and service marks and believe that the domino’s ® mark and domino’s pizza ® names and logos in particular have significant value and are important to our business our policy is to pursue registration of our trademarks and to vigorously oppose the infringement of any of our trademarks we license the use of our registered marks to franchisees through franchise agreements 

environmental matters 

we are not aware of any federal state or local environmental laws or regulations that will materially affect our earnings or competitive position or result in material capital expenditures however we cannot predict the effect of possible future environmental legislation or regulations during 2006 there were no material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities and no such material expenditures are anticipated in 2007 

employees 

as of december 31 2006 we had approximately 13300 employees who we refer to as team members in our companyowned stores distribution centers world resource center our corporate headquarters and regional offices as franchisees are independent business owners they and their employees are not included in our employee count we consider our relationship with our employees and franchisees to be good we estimate the total number of people who work in the domino’s pizza system including our employees franchisees and the employees of franchisees was nearly 170000 as of december 31 2006 

none of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement 

safety 

our commitment to safety is embodied in our hiring training and review process before an applicant is considered for hire as a delivery driver in the united states motor vehicle records are reviewed to ensure a minimum safe driving record of one or two years in addition we require regular checks of driving records and proof of insurance for delivery drivers throughout their employment with us each domestic domino’s driver including drivers employed by franchisees must complete our safe delivery training program we have also implemented several safe driving incentive programs 

our safety and security department oversees security matters for our stores regional security and safety directors oversee security measures at store locations and assist local authorities in investigations of incidents involving our stores or personnel 

  

community activities 

we believe in supporting the communities we serve and we base our corporate giving on three simple elements delivering charitable support to our own team members to our customers and to national programs 

national philanthropic partner 

we have a tradition of creating multiyear partnerships with national charities to raise funds and public awareness for the organization our current national philanthropic partner is st jude children’s research hospital st jude is internationally recognized for its pioneering work in finding cures and saving children with cancer and other catastrophic diseases through a variety of internal and consumerbased activities including a national fundraising campaign called thanks and giving the domino’s pizza system has contributed more than 25 million to st jude in the first three years of the partnership in addition to raising funds the domino’s pizza system has supported st jude through inkind donations including hosting hospitalwide pizza parties for patients and their families the domino’s pizza system also helps st jude build awareness through the inclusion of the st jude logo on millions of our pizza boxes and through a link on our consumer web site 

the domino’s pizza partners foundation

franchisee involvement

research and development 

we operate research and product development facilities at our world resource center in ann arbor michigan companysponsored research and development activities which include among other things testing new products for possible menu additions are an important activity to us and our franchisees we do not consider the amounts we spend on research and development to be material 

insurance 

we maintain insurance coverage for general liability owned and nonowned automobile liability workers’ compensation employment practices liability directors’ and officers’ liability fiduciary property including leaseholds and equipment as well as business interruption commercial crime global risks product contamination and other coverages in such form and with such limits as we believe are customary for a business of our size and type

 item 1a risk factors 

risks relating to our business and industry 

the pizza category is highly competitive and such competition could adversely affect our operating results 

we compete in the united states against two national chains as well as many regional and local businesses we could experience increased competition from existing or new companies in the pizza category which could create increasing pressures to grow our business in order to maintain our market share if we are unable to maintain our competitive position we could experience downward pressure on prices lower demand for our products reduced margins the inability to take advantage of new business opportunities and the loss of market share all of which would have an adverse effect on our operating results and could cause our stock price to decline 

we also compete on a broader scale with quick service and other international national regional and local restaurants the overall food service market and the quick service restaurant sector are intensely competitive with respect to food quality price service convenience and concept and are often affected by changes in 

• consumer tastes 

• national regional or local economic conditions 

• disposable purchasing power 

• demographic trends and 

• currency fluctuations to the extent international operations are involved 

we compete within the food service market and the quick service restaurant sector not only for customers but also for management and hourly employees suitable real estate sites and qualified franchisees our domestic distribution segment is also subject to competition from outside suppliers if other suppliers who meet our qualification standards were to offer lower prices or better service to our franchisees for their ingredients and supplies and as a result our franchisees chose not to purchase from our domestic distribution centers our financial condition business and results of operations would be adversely affected 

if we fail to successfully implement our growth strategy which includes opening new domestic and international stores our ability to increase our revenues and operating profits could be adversely affected 

a significant component of our growth strategy is opening new domestic and international stores we and our franchisees face many challenges in opening new stores including among others 

• selection and availability of suitable store locations 

• negotiation of acceptable lease or financing terms 

• securing required domestic or foreign governmental permits and approvals and 

• employment and training of qualified personnel 

the opening of additional franchise stores also depends in part upon the availability of prospective franchisees who meet our criteria our failure to add a significant number of new stores would adversely affect our ability to increase revenues and operating income 

we are currently planning to expand our international operations in markets where we currently operate and in selected new markets this may require considerable management time as well as startup expenses for market development before any significant revenues and earnings are generated operations in new foreign markets may achieve low margins or may be unprofitable and expansion in existing markets may by affected by local economic and market conditions therefore as we expand internationally we may not experience the operating margins we expect our results of operations may be negatively impacted and our common stock price may decline 

we may also pursue strategic acquisitions as part of our business if we are able to identify acquisition candidates such acquisitions may be financed to the extent permitted under our debt agreements with substantial debt or with potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities 

the food service market is affected by consumer preferences and perceptions changes in these preferences and perceptions may lessen the demand for our products which would reduce sales and harm our business 

food service businesses are affected by changes in consumer tastes national regional and local economic conditions and demographic trends for instance if prevailing health or dietary preferences cause consumers to avoid pizza and other products we offer in favor of foods that are perceived as more healthy our business and operating results would be harmed moreover because we are primarily dependent on a single product if consumer demand for pizza should decrease our business would suffer more than if we had a more diversified menu as many other food service businesses do 

  

increases in food labor and other costs could adversely affect our profitability and operating results 

an increase in our operating costs could adversely affect our profitability factors such as inflation increased food costs increased labor and employee benefit costs and increased energy costs may adversely affect our operating costs most of the factors affecting costs are beyond our control and in many cases we may not be able to pass along these increased costs to our customers or franchisees most ingredients used in our pizza particularly cheese are subject to significant price fluctuations as a result of seasonality weather demand and other factors the cheese block price per pound averaged 124 in 2006 and the estimated increase in companyowned store food costs from a hypothetical 025 adverse change in the average cheese block price per pound would have been approximately 39 million in 2006 labor costs are largely a function of the minimum wage for a majority of our store personnel and certain distribution center personnel and generally are a function of the availability of labor food including cheese costs and labor represent approximately 45 to 60 of a typical companyowned store’s cost of sales 

our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our business and limit our ability to plan for or respond to changes in our business 

assuming we complete the recapitalization substantially as contemplated we will hold a substantial amount of indebtedness and will be highly leveraged in addition none of the proceeds from the bridge loan facility or securitized debt other than the securitized variable funding senior notes are expected to be used for working capital as of december 31 2006 our consolidated longterm indebtedness was 7416 million we expect that after we complete the recapitalization assuming we refinance the bridge loan facility with the securitized debt and assuming no draws under the 150 million variable funding senior notes our consolidated longterm indebtedness will be approximately 17 billion we may also incur additional debt following the recapitalization which would not be prohibited under the terms of the securitized debt our substantial indebtedness and the fact that a large portion of our cash flow from operations must be used to make principal and interest payments on our indebtedness could have important consequences to our business and our shareholders for example they could 

• make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our debt agreements 

• increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions 

• require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow for other purposes and 

• limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and the industry in which we operate thereby placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that may have less debt 

in addition the financial and other covenants we agree to with our lenders will limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness make investments pay dividends and engage in other transactions and the leverage may cause potential lenders to be less willing to loan funds to us in the future our failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default that if not cured or waived could result in the acceleration of repayment of all of our indebtedness 

we may be unable to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our significant debt service obligations which would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

our ability to make principal and interest payments on and to refinance our indebtedness will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future this to a certain extent is subject to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control if our business does not generate sufficient cash flow from operations if currently anticipated cost savings and operating improvements are not realized on schedule in the amounts projected or at all or if future borrowings are not available to us under our senior secured credit facility in amounts sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected if we cannot generate sufficient cash flow from operations to make scheduled principal and interest payments on our debt obligations in the future we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity sell assets delay capital expenditures or seek additional equity if we are unable to refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all or to effect any other action relating to our indebtedness on satisfactory terms or at all our business may be harmed 

  

the terms of the domino’s inc senior secured credit facility and senior subordinated notes have restrictive terms and our failure to comply with any of these terms could put us in default which would have an adverse effect on our business and prospects 

unless and until we repay all outstanding borrowings under our senior secured credit facility and successfully complete the debt tender offer as part of the recapitalization we will remain subject to the restrictive terms of these borrowings the senior secured credit facility and the indenture governing the senior subordinated notes in each case where our whollyowned subsidiary domino’s inc is the borrower contain a number of significant covenants these covenants limit domino’s inc’s ability and the ability of domino’s inc’s restricted subsidiaries to among other things 

• incur additional indebtedness and issue restricted subsidiary preferred stock 

• make capital expenditures and other investments 

• merge consolidate or dispose of our assets or the capital stock or assets of any restricted subsidiary 

• pay dividends make distributions or redeem capital stock 

• change our line of business 

• enter into transactions with our affiliates and 

• grant liens on our assets or the assets of our restricted subsidiaries 

the senior secured credit facility also requires us to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy financial condition tests at the end of each fiscal quarter these restrictions could affect our ability to pay dividends or repurchase shares of our common stock our ability to meet these financial ratios and tests can be affected by events beyond our control and we may not satisfy those tests a breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under the senior secured credit facility if the banks accelerate amounts owing under the senior secured credit facility because of a default under the senior secured credit facility and we are unable to pay such amounts the banks have the right to foreclose on substantially all of our assets 

upon the occurrence of specific kinds of change of control events domino’s inc must offer to repurchase all of its outstanding senior subordinated notes it is possible however that we will not have sufficient funds at the time of the change of control to make the required repurchase of the senior subordinated notes or that restrictions in the senior secured credit facility will not allow such repurchase the occurrence of some of the events that would constitute a change of control under the indenture would also constitute a default under the senior secured credit facility moreover the exercise by the holders of the senior subordinated notes of their right to require domino’s inc to repurchase the senior subordinated notes could cause a default under such senior indebtedness even if the change of control itself does not due to the financial effect on us of such repurchase a default under the indenture or the senior secured credit facility may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we expect to fund the equity tender offer repay our existing senior secured credit facility finance the debt tender offer and pay all related fees and expenses by drawing on the bridge loan facility and to refinance the bridge loan facility with new securitized debt if we are unable to repay or refinance the bridge loan facility or the securitized debt it could have a significant negative effect on our financial condition 

we have obtained a commitment subject to customary conditions from a syndicate of banks to provide a bridge loan facility in connection with the recapitalization draws made under the bridge loan facility will be subject to certain conditions the initial draw is expected to be subject to among other conditions i the absence of any event circumstance development change or effect that is or would be materially adverse to our business to our ability to perform our obligations under the bridge loan documentation or to the rights and remedies of the lenders under the bridge loan documentation or a “material adverse effect” ii the absence of any continuing default or event of default and iii the accuracy of all representations and warranties in all material respects subsequent draws for purposes of funding the equity tender offer and the debt tender offer are expected to be conditioned upon i the absence of a material adverse effect ii the absence of any litigation reasonably likely to result in a material adverse effect or prohibit restrict or enjoin the transactions contemplated in the recapitalization iii the absence of a bankruptcy default and iv the accuracy of the representations and warranties relating to the financial statements and financial condition of domino’s inc all other borrowings under the bridge loan facility are expected to be subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions including the absence of a default and the accuracy of representations and warranties 

  

the bridge loan facility is expected to be for a oneyear term but the bridge term loans may be converted into senior term loans maturing on the fifth anniversary of the initial drawing subject to certain terms and conditions we expect to refinance our borrowings under the bridge loan facility with new securitized debt we expect that during the first five years following issuance assuming we do not exercise either of our two oneyear interest only extension options following the fiveyear interest only period the securitized debt will accrue interest at an original spread plus the fiveyear swap rate after which it will be subject to amortization and may be subject to an increased interest rate if it is not repaid or refinanced 

if we are unable to refinance or repay the amounts outstanding under the bridge loan facility prior to the expiration of the initial oneyear term either through borrowings under our expected securitized debt or otherwise our financial position results of operations and business could be adversely affected in addition if we are unable to refinance the bridge loan facility with securitized debt in anticipated amounts we may not be able to pay the expected significant special cash dividend if we are unable to refinance or repay amounts under the bridge loan facility prior to the expiration of the fiveyear term applicable to such debt such failure would be an event of default under the credit agreement that governs the bridge loan facility if we are unable to refinance or repay amounts under the anticipated securitized debt prior to the expiration of the fiveyear interestonly term sevenyear interest only term if we exercise both of our oneyear extension elections our cash flow would be directed to the repayment of the securitized debt and other than a weekly fee sufficient to cover minimal selling general and administrative expenses would not be available for operating our business 

no assurance can be given that any refinancing or additional financing will be possible when needed or that we will be able to negotiate acceptable terms in addition our access to capital is affected by prevailing conditions in the financial and capital markets and other factors beyond our control there can be no assurance that market conditions will be favorable at the times that we require new or additional financing 

our bridge loan facility will have restrictive terms and our failure to comply with any of these terms could put us in default which would have an adverse effect on our business and prospects 

we expect to enter into a bridge loan facility that will require that we comply on a quarterly basis with certain financial covenants including a maximum leverage ratio test and a minimum interest coverage ratio test in addition we expect that the bridge loan facility will include negative covenants subject to exceptions restricting or limiting our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to among other things 

• sell assets 

• alter the business we conduct 

• engage in mergers acquisitions and other business combinations 

• declare dividends or redeem or repurchase capital stock 

• incur assume or permit to exist additional indebtedness or guarantees 

• make loans and investments 

• incur liens 

• prepay redeem or purchase certain subordinated indebtedness 

• enter into agreements limiting subsidiary distributions 

• enter into transactions with affiliates and 

• make capital expenditures 

a breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under the bridge loan facility if the banks were to accelerate amounts owing under the bridge loan facility because of a default and we were unable to pay such amounts the banks would have the right to foreclose on substantially all of our assets 

the indenture governing the securitized debt will restrict the cash flow from the entities subject to the securitization to any of our other entities and upon the occurrence of certain events cash flow would be further restricted 

in the event that a rapid amortization event occurs under the indenture including without limitation upon an event of default under the indenture or the failure to repay the securitized debt at the end of the five year interestonly period or at the end of any extension period the funds available to us will be reduced or eliminated which would in turn reduce our ability to operate or grow our business 

  

we do not have longterm contracts with many of our suppliers and as a result they could seek to significantly increase prices or fail to deliver 

we typically do not have written contracts or formal longterm arrangements with many of our suppliers although in the past we have not experienced significant problems with our suppliers our suppliers may implement significant price increases or may not meet our requirements in a timely fashion if at all the occurrence of any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

shortages or interruptions in the supply or delivery of fresh food products could adversely affect our operating results 

we and our franchisees are dependent on frequent deliveries of fresh food products that meet our specifications shortages or interruptions in the supply of fresh food products caused by unanticipated demand problems in production or distribution inclement weather or other conditions could adversely affect the availability quality and cost of ingredients which would adversely affect our operating results 

any prolonged disruption in the operations of any of our dough manufacturing and distribution centers could harm our business 

we operate 17 regional dough manufacturing and distribution centers and one vegetable processing distribution center in the contiguous united states and dough manufacturing and distribution centers in alaska hawaii and canada our domestic dough manufacturing and distribution centers service all of our companyowned stores and over 98 of our domestic franchise stores as a result any prolonged disruption in the operations of any of these facilities whether due to technical or labor difficulties destruction or damage to the facility real estate issues or other reasons could adversely affect our business and operating results 

we face risks of litigation from customers franchisees employees and others in the ordinary course of business which diverts our financial and management resources any adverse litigation or publicity may negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations 

claims of illness or injury relating to food quality or food handling are common in the food service industry in addition class action lawsuits have been filed and may continue to be filed against various quick service restaurants alleging among other things that quick service restaurants have failed to disclose the health risks associated with highfat foods and that quick service restaurant marketing practices have encouraged obesity in addition to decreasing our sales and profitability and diverting our management resources adverse publicity or a substantial judgment against us could negatively impact our financial condition results of operations and brand reputation hindering our ability to attract and retain franchisees and grow our business 

further we may be subject to employee franchisee and other claims in the future based on among other things discrimination harassment wrongful termination and wage rest break and meal break issues including those relating to overtime compensation we have been subject to these types of claims in the past and we are currently subject to a purported class action claim of this type in california relating to rest break and meal break compensation and if one or more of these claims were to be successful or if there is a significant increase in the number of these claims our business financial condition and operating results could be harmed 

loss of key personnel or our inability to attract and retain new qualified personnel could hurt our business and inhibit our ability to operate and grow successfully 

our success in the highly competitive business of pizza delivery will continue to depend to a significant extent on our leadership team and other key management personnel other than with our chairman and chief executive officer david a brandon we do not have longterm employment agreements with any of our executive officers as a result we may not be able to retain our executive officers and key personnel or attract additional qualified management our success also will continue to depend on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel to operate our stores dough manufacturing and distribution centers and international operations the loss of these employees or our inability to recruit and retain qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 

  

our international operations subject us to additional risk such risks and costs may differ in each country in which we do business and may cause our profitability to decline due to increased costs 

we conduct a portion of our business outside the united states our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected if global markets in which our franchise stores compete are affected by changes in political economic or other factors these factors over which neither we nor our franchisees have control may include 

 

          fluctuations in the value of the us dollar in relation to other currencies may lead to lower revenues and earnings 

exchange rate fluctuations could have an adverse effect on our results of operations approximately 81 86 and 86 of our total revenues were derived from our international segment in 2004 2005 and 2006 respectively a majority of which were denominated in foreign currencies sales made by our stores outside the united states are denominated in the currency of the country in which the store is located and this currency could become less valuable prior to conversion to us dollars as a result of exchange rate fluctuations unfavorable currency fluctuations could lead to increased prices to customers outside the united states or lower profitability to our franchisees outside the united states or could result in lower revenues for us on a us dollar basis from such customers and franchisees 

we may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property which could harm the value of our brand and branded products and adversely affect our business 

we depend in large part on our brand and branded products and believe that they are very important to our business we rely on a combination of trademarks copyrights service marks trade secrets and similar intellectual property rights to protect our brand and branded products the success of our business depends on our continued ability to use our existing trademarks and service marks in order to increase brand awareness and further develop our branded products in both domestic and international markets we have registered certain trademarks and have other trademark registrations pending in the united states and foreign jurisdictions not all of the trademarks that we currently use have been registered in all of the countries in which we do business and they may never be registered in all of these countries we may not be able to adequately protect our trademarks and our use of these trademarks may result in liability for trademark infringement trademark dilution or unfair competition all of the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property in the united states and in foreign countries may not be adequate in addition the laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states further through acquisitions of third parties we may acquire brands and related trademarks that are subject to the same risks as the brands and trademarks we currently own 

we may from time to time be required to institute litigation to enforce our trademarks or other intellectual property rights or to protect our trade secrets such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could negatively affect our sales profitability and prospects regardless of whether we are able to successfully enforce our rights 

  

our earnings and business growth strategy depends on the success of our franchisees and we may be harmed by actions taken by our franchisees that are outside of our control 

a significant portion of our earnings comes from royalties generated by our franchise stores franchisees are independent operators and their employees are not our employees we provide limited training and support to franchisees but the quality of franchise store operations may be diminished by any number of factors beyond our control consequently franchisees may not successfully operate stores in a manner consistent with our standards and requirements or may not hire and train qualified managers and other store personnel if they do not our image and reputation may suffer and our revenues and stock price could decline while we try to ensure that our franchisees maintain the quality of our brand and branded products our franchisees may take actions that adversely affect the value of our intellectual property or reputation as of december 31 2006 we had 1259 domestic franchisees operating 4572 domestic stores five of these franchisees each operate over 50 domestic stores including our largest domestic franchisee which operates 140 stores and the average franchisee operates three to four stores in addition our international master franchisees are generally responsible for the development of significantly more stores than our domestic franchisees as a result our international operations are more closely tied to the success of a smaller number of franchisees than our domestic operations our largest international master franchisee operates 620 stores in five markets which accounts for approximately 19 of our total international store count our domestic and international franchisees may not operate their franchises successfully if one or more of our key franchisees were to become insolvent or otherwise were unable or unwilling to pay us our royalties our business and results of operations would be adversely affected 

we are subject to extensive government regulation and our failure to comply with existing or increased regulations could adversely affect our business and operating results 

we are subject to numerous federal state local and foreign laws and regulations including those relating to 

 

       we may become subject to legislation or regulation seeking to tax andor regulate highfat foods if we fail to comply with existing or future laws and regulations we may be subject to governmental or judicial fines or sanctions in addition our capital expenditures could increase due to remediation measures that may be required if we are found to be noncompliant with any of these laws or regulations 

we are also subject to a federal trade commission rule and to various state and foreign laws that govern the offer and sale of franchises additionally these laws regulate various aspects of the franchise relationship including terminations and the refusal to renew franchises the failure to comply with these laws and regulations in any jurisdiction or to obtain required government approvals could result in a ban or temporary suspension on future franchise sales fines or other penalties or require us to make offers of rescission or restitution any of which could adversely affect our business and operating results 

our current insurance coverage may not be adequate insurance premiums for such coverage may increase and we may not be able to obtain insurance at acceptable rates or at all 

we have retention programs for workers’ compensation general liability and owned and nonowned automobile liabilities we are generally responsible for up to 10 million per occurrence under these retention programs for workers’ compensation and general liability we are also generally responsible for between 500000 and 30 million per occurrence under these retention programs for owned and nonowned automobile liabilities total insurance limits under these retention programs vary depending upon the period covered and range up to 1080 million per occurrence for general liability and owned and nonowned automobile liabilities and up to the applicable statutory limits for workers’ compensation these insurance policies may not be adequate to protect us from liabilities that we incur in our business in addition in the future our insurance premiums may increase and we may not be able to obtain similar levels of insurance on reasonable terms or at all any such inadequacy of or inability to obtain insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations we are not required to and do not specifically set aside funds for our retention programs 

  

our annual and quarterly financial results are subject to significant fluctuations depending on various factors many of which are beyond our control and if we fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors our share price may decline significantly 

our sales and operating results can vary significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year depending on various factors many of which are beyond our control these factors include 

 

      as a result our results of operations may decline quickly and significantly in response to changes in order patterns or rapid decreases in demand for our products we anticipate that fluctuations in operating results will continue in the future 

our current principal stockholders have significant influence over us and they could delay deter or prevent a change of control or other business combination or otherwise cause us to take action with which you may disagree 

investment funds associated with bain capital llc together beneficially own approximately 27 of our outstanding common stock assuming the successful completion of the recapitalization the investment funds associated with bain capital llc together could beneficially own up to onethird of our outstanding common stock and potentially more if there are open market repurchases in which these fund do not participate after completion of the recapitalization in addition two of our directors are representatives of investment funds associated with bain capital llc as a result these investment funds associated with bain capital llc have significant influence over our decision to enter into any corporate transaction and may have the ability to prevent any transaction that requires the approval of stockholders regardless of whether or not other stockholders believe that such transaction is in their own best interests such concentration of voting power could have the effect of delaying deterring or preventing a change of control or other business combination that might otherwise be beneficial to our stockholders 

our common stock price could be subject to significant fluctuations andor may decline 

the market price of our common stock could be subject to significant fluctuations among the factors that could affect our stock price are 

 

          the stock markets in general have recently experienced volatility that has sometimes been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies these broad market fluctuations may cause the trading price of our common stock to decline 

  

after the completion of the equity tender offer our common stock may have a significantly smaller public float which could result in reduced liquidity for our common stock and greater volatility in the market price of our common stock 

as of february 15 2007 approximately 45422429 shares of our common stock were held by nonaffiliated shareholders assuming the equity tender offer is fully subscribed we estimate we will have approximately 32700165 shares held by nonaffiliated shareholders following the recapitalization historically the common stock of a company with a smaller public float may be less liquid than the common stock of a company with broader public ownership and the trading prices for the common stock of a company with a smaller public float may be more volatile than generally may be the case for more widely held common stock among other things a decreased trading volume of our common stock may have a greater impact on the trading price of our common stock than would be the case if our public float were larger we cannot predict the prices at which our common stock will trade in the future future open market purchases if authorized would further reduce our public float

 item 2 properties 

we lease approximately 200000 square feet for our world resource center located in ann arbor michigan under an operating lease with domino’s farms office park llc which is owned and operated by our founder and former majority shareholder the lease as amended expires in december 2013 and has two fiveyear renewal options

 item 3 legal proceedings 

we are a party to lawsuits revenue agent reviews by taxing authorities and administrative proceedings in the ordinary course of business which include workers’ compensation general liability automobile and franchisee claims we are also subject to suits related to employment practices and specifically in california wage and hour claims and two class actions pending in california brought by former employees on june 10 2003 vega v domino’s pizza llc was filed in orange county superior court alleging that we failed to provide meal and rest breaks to our employees no determination with respect to class certification has been made on august 2 2006 roselio v domino’s pizza llc was filed in los angeles county superior court alleging similar claims as set out in the vega lawsuit  we are seeking to coordinate these two actions in orange county superior court 

on august 19 2004 jimenez v domino’s pizza llc was filed by a former general manager in orange county superior court alleging that we misclassified the position of general manager and that the company did not provide mealrest periods and overtime pay as required by state law for hourly employees the case was removed to federal district court for the central district of california on september 17 2004 and the motion for class certification was heard on june 5 2006 on september 26 2006 the court denied the plaintiff’s motion for class certification 

we believe that these matters individually and in the aggregate will not have a significant adverse effect on our financial condition and that our established reserves adequately provide for the resolution of such claims

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

overview 

our fiscal year typically includes 52 weeks comprised of three twelve week quarters and one sixteen week quarter every five or six years our fiscal year includes an extra or 53 rd  week in the fourth quarter of that year fiscal 2004 consisted of 53 weeks while fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2006 consisted of 52 weeks 

we are the number one pizza delivery company in the united states with a 190 share of the pizza delivery market based on reported consumer spending we also have a leading international presence we operate through a network of 571 companyowned stores all of which are in the united states and 7795 franchise stores located in all 50 states and in more than 50 countries in addition we operate 17 regional dough manufacturing and distribution centers in the contiguous united states as well as six dough manufacturing and distribution centers outside the contiguous united states 

our financial results are driven largely by retail sales at our companyowned and franchise stores changes in retail sales are driven by changes in same store sales and store counts we monitor both of these metrics very closely as they directly impact our revenues and profits and strive to consistently increase the related amounts retail sales drive companyowned store revenues royalty payments from franchisees and distribution revenues retail sales are primarily impacted by the strength of the domino’s pizza ® brand the success of our marketing promotions and our ability to execute our store operating model and other business strategies 

we devote significant attention to our brandbuilding efforts which is evident in our system’s estimated 14 billion of domestic advertising spending over the past five years and our frequent designation as a megabrand by advertising age  we plan on continuing to build our brand and retail sales by satisfying customers worldwide with our pizza delivery offerings and by continuing to invest significant amounts in the advertising and marketing of the domino’s pizza ® brand 

we also pay particular attention to the store economics or the investment performance of a store to its owner of both our companyowned and franchise stores we believe that our system’s favorable store economics benefit from the relatively small initial and ongoing investments required to own and operate a domino’s pizza store we believe these favorable investment requirements coupled with a strong brand message supported by significant advertising spending as well as highquality and focused menu offerings drive strong store economics which in turn drive demand for new stores 

in 2006 global retail sales which are total retail sales at companyowned and franchise stores worldwide increased 20 as compared to 2005 this increase in global retail sales was driven by strong international same store sales growth as well as global unit growth offset in part by a decrease in domestic same store sales in 2005 global retail sales increased 78 as compared to 2004 despite having a 53 rd week in 2004 which negatively impacted our 2005 global retail sales growth by approximately two percentage points this increase in global retail sales was driven by both strong domestic and international same store sales growth as well as global unit growth 

our revenues decreased 743 million in 2006 largely due to lower distribution revenues due primarily to lower volumes related to decreases in domestic same store sales and lower food prices including cheese worldwide store counts have increased from 7427 at the beginning of 2004 to 8366 at the end of 2006 this growth in store counts can be attributed to the growing global acceptance of our brand and our pizza delivery concept as well as the economics inherent in our system which attracts new franchisees and encourages existing franchisees to grow their business domestic same store sales increased 18 and 49 in 2004 and 2005 respectively and decreased 41 in 2006 international same store sales increased 59 61 and 40 during the same periods we believe that our mix of new product introductions and strong valueoriented promotional activities have historically produced strong same store sales results the company’s domestic same store sales results in 2006 reflected a weaker economy and the underperformance of our product and promotional offerings during the year internationally same stores sales growth continues to result from the growing acceptance of delivered pizza around the globe and the successful execution of the concept 

income from operations has increased 250 from 1714 million in 2004 to 2142 million in 2006 this growth in income from operations was primarily the result of increases in global retail sales and related profits from distribution center operations as well as decreases in general and administrative expenses net income increased from 623 million in 2004 to 1062 million in 2006 

  

we are highly leveraged primarily as the result of recapitalizations in 1998 and 2003 as of december 31 2006 consolidated longterm debt was 7416 million since 1998 a large portion of our cash flows provided from operations has been used to make principal and interest payments on our indebtedness our senior subordinated notes require no principal payments until maturity in 2011 our senior credit facility requires principal payments of 12 million 48 million 60 million and 4511 million in 2007 2008 2009 and 2010 respectively we have decreased our total leverage ratio or total debt divided by total segment income from 39x at the time of our 2004 initial public offering to 30x at the end of 2006 as a result of both debt reductions and continued improved operating performance overall we believe that our ability to consistently produce significant free cash flows allows us the flexibility not only to service our significant debt but also invest in our business pay dividends to our shareholders and opportunistically repurchase outstanding common stock 

recent development 

on february 7 2007 we announced a recapitalization which comprises i a tender offer to purchase up to 13850000 shares of our common stock which is expected to expire on march 9 2007 the “equity tender offer” ii a tender offer and consent solicitation for any and all of our outstanding 8 1  4  senior subordinated notes due 2011 which is expected to expire on march 9 2007 the “debt tender offer” iii the repayment of all outstanding borrowings and related accrued interest under our current senior secured credit facility and the termination of that facility and iv new borrowings of up to 185 billion in securitized debt of which 150 million would be a revolving credit facility although we are currently negotiating the terms and availability of this securitized debt we anticipate that we will obtain the funds required to finance the repayment of our existing borrowings under our senior secured credit facility the equity tender offer and the debt tender offer as well as to pay all related fees and expenses from a bridge loan facility we expect to enter into with a syndicate of banks financial institutions and other entities that is expected to provide for borrowings of up to 135 billion the “bridge loan facility” we have obtained a commitment subject to customary conditions from a syndicate of banks to provide the bridge loan facility 

in this annual report on form 10k we refer to the foregoing transactions as the “recapitalization” in addition following the recapitalization we expect subject to the approval of our board of directors to pay a significant special cash dividend to our shareholders and our board of directors will consider authorizing future open market repurchases of our common stock any such special dividend payment and open market repurchases are expected to use substantially all of any remaining proceeds of the securitized debt and no proceeds other than under the securitized variable funding senior notes are expected to be used for working capital or other general corporate purposes in the event that a special cash dividend is paid we have approved a separate dividend equivalent rights policy to i allow holders of vested stock options or options that vest in calendar year 2007 including our directors executive officers and certain team members to receive a cash payment in respect of such options equal to the amount of the dividend that would be paid on the shares underlying the options and ii allow holders of unvested stock options to have the option exercise price reduced to the extent permitted by applicable law to reflect the amount of the dividend 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america the preparation of these financial statements requires our management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis our management evaluates its estimates including those related to revenue recognition allowance for uncollectible receivables longlived and intangible assets insurance and legal matters and income taxes we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from those estimates changes in our accounting policies and estimates could materially impact our results of operations and financial condition for any particular period we believe that our most critical accounting policies and estimates are 

revenue recognition  we earn revenues through our network of domestic companyowned and franchise stores dough manufacturing and distribution centers and international operations retail sales from companyowned stores and royalty revenues resulting from the retail sales from franchise stores are recognized as revenues when the items are delivered to or carried out by customers sales of food from our distribution centers are recognized as revenues upon delivery of the food to franchisees while sales of equipment and supplies from our distribution centers are generally recognized as revenues upon shipment of the related products to franchisees 

  

allowance for uncollectible receivables we closely monitor our accounts and notes receivable balances and provide allowances for uncollectible amounts as a result of our reviews these estimates are based on among other factors historical collection experience and a review of our receivables by aging category additionally we may also provide allowances for uncollectible receivables based on specific customer collection issues that we have identified while writeoffs of bad debts have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established management cannot guarantee that future writeoffs will not exceed historical rates specifically if the financial condition of our franchisees were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments additional allowances may be required 

longlived and intangible assets we record longlived assets including property plant and equipment and capitalized software at cost for acquisitions of franchise operations we estimate the fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired based on physical inspection of assets historical experience and other information available to us regarding the acquisition we depreciate and amortize longlived assets using useful lives determined by us based on historical experience and other information available to us we review longlived assets for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that the related amounts might be impaired we perform related impairment tests on a market level basis for companyowned stores at december 31 2006 we determined that our longlived assets were not impaired however if our future operating performance were to deteriorate we may be required to recognize an impairment charge 

we evaluate goodwill for impairment by comparing the fair value of our reporting units to their carrying values a significant portion of our goodwill relates to acquisitions of domestic franchise stores and is included in our domestic stores segment at december 31 2006 the fair value of our business operations with associated goodwill exceeded their recorded carrying value including the related goodwill however if the future performance of our domestic companyowned stores or other reporting units were to deteriorate we may be required to recognize a goodwill impairment charge 

insurance and legal matters we are a party to lawsuits and legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business management closely monitors these legal matters and estimates the probable costs for the resolution of such matters these estimates are primarily determined by consulting with both internal and external parties handling the matters and are based upon an analysis of potential results assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies if our estimates relating to legal matters proved inaccurate for any reason we may be required to increase or decrease the related expense in future periods 

for certain periods prior to december 1998 and for periods after december 2001 we maintain insurance coverage for workers’ compensation general liability and owned and nonowned auto liability under insurance policies requiring payment of a deductible for each occurrence up to between 500000 and 30 million depending on the policy year and line of coverage the related insurance reserves are based on undiscounted independent actuarial estimates which are based on historical information along with assumptions about future events changes in assumptions for such factors as medical costs and legal actions as well as changes in actual experience could cause these estimates to change in the near term which could result in an increase or decrease in the related expense in future periods 

income taxes our net deferred tax assets assume that we will generate sufficient taxable income in specific tax jurisdictions based on estimates and assumptions the amounts relating to taxes recorded on the balance sheet including tax reserves also consider the ultimate resolution of revenue agent reviews based on estimates and assumptions if these estimates and assumptions change in the future we may be required to adjust our valuation allowance or other tax reserves resulting in additional income tax expense or benefit in future periods

 2006 compared to 2005 

tabular amounts in millions except percentages 

revenues revenues include retail sales by companyowned stores royalties from domestic and international franchise stores and sales of food equipment and supplies by our distribution centers to certain domestic and international franchise stores 

consolidated revenues decreased 743 million or 49 in 2006 this decrease in revenues was due primarily to lower volumes in our distribution business related to decreases in domestic franchise same store sales and lower food prices primarily cheese as well as lower companyowned store and international revenues these decreases in revenues are more fully described below 

domestic stores domestic stores revenues are comprised of retail sales from domestic companyowned store operations and royalties from retail sales at domestic franchise stores as summarized in the following table 

 

   

domestic stores revenues decreased 118 million or 21 in 2006 this decrease was due primarily to lower domestic same store sales offset in part by an increase in the average number of domestic stores open during 2006 these results are more fully described below 

domestic companyowned stores revenues from domestic companyowned store operations decreased 76 million or 19 in 2006 this decrease was due primarily to lower same store sales domestic companyowned same store sales decreased 22 in 2006 compared to 2005 there were 581 and 571 domestic companyowned stores in operation as of january 1 2006 and december 31 2006 respectively

domestic distribution revenues from domestic distribution operations decreased 563 million or 69 in 2006 this decrease was due primarily to decreases in cheese prices as well as lower volumes related to decreases in domestic franchise same store sales cheese prices negatively impacted revenues by approximately 356 million in 2006 

international revenues from international operations decreased 62 million or 48 in 2006 this decrease was due primarily to the sale of companyowned operations in france and the netherlands and were offset in part by higher royalty revenues due to increases in same store sales and the average number of international stores open during 2006 on a constant dollar basis same store sales increased 40 in 2006 compared to 2005 on a historical dollar basis same store sales increased 46 in 2006 compared to 2005 reflecting a generally weaker us dollar in those markets in which we compete there were 2987 and 3223 international stores in operation as of january 1 2006 and december 31 2006 respectively 

cost of sales  operating margin consolidated cost of sales is comprised primarily of companyowned store and domestic distribution costs incurred to generate related revenues components of consolidated cost of sales primarily include food labor and occupancy costs 

the consolidated operating margin which we define as revenues less cost of sales decreased 08 million or 02 in 2006 as summarized in the following table 

 

 the 08 million decrease in consolidated operating margin was due primarily to lower margins at our companyowned stores and lower domestic franchise royalty revenues offset in part by higher margins in our international business and improved margins in our distribution operations franchise revenues do not have a cost of sales component and as a result changes in franchise revenues have a disproportionate effect on the consolidated operating margin 

as a percentage of total revenues our consolidated operating margin increased primarily as a result of a market decrease in overall food prices primarily cheese which benefited both domestic companyowned store and domestic distribution operating margins as a percentage of revenues as well as improvements in the operating margins in our international operations these increases were offset in part by lower domestic same store sales which generated lower domestic franchise royalty revenues lower distribution volumes and lower domestic companyowned store revenues changes in the operating margin at our domestic companyowned store operations and our domestic distribution operations are more fully described below 

domestic companyowned stores the domestic companyowned store operating margin decreased 06 million or 08 in 2006 as summarized in the following table 

 

 the 06 million decrease in the domestic companyowned store operating margin is due primarily to lower same store sales and higher occupancy costs including utilities and rent and was offset in part by a market decrease in overall food prices primarily cheese 

  

as a percentage of store revenues food costs decreased 18 percentage points to 262 in 2006 due primarily to a market decrease in food prices primarily cheese and a higher average ticket the cheese block price per pound averaged 124 in 2006 compared to 150 in 2005 

as a percentage of store revenues labor costs increased 05 percentage points to 301 in 2006 due primarily to the negative impact of lower revenues 

as a percentage of store revenues occupancy costs which include rent telephone utilities and other related costs including depreciation and amortization increased 09 percentage points to 120 in 2006 due primarily to higher utilities and rent as well as the negative impact of lower revenues 

as a percentage of store revenues insurance costs decreased 03 percentage points to 31 in 2006 due primarily to improved loss experience

 the 13 million increase in the domestic distribution operating margin was due primarily to lower food and labor costs 

as a percentage of distribution revenues the distribution operating margin increased primarily as a result lower food prices primarily cheese offset in part by lower volumes as a result of lower domestic franchise same store sales decreases in certain food prices including cheese have a positive effect on the distribution operating margin due to the fixed dollar margin earned by domestic distribution on certain food items including cheese had the 2006 cheese prices been in effect during 2005 the domestic distribution operating margin as a percentage of domestic distribution revenues would have been approximately 102 for 2005 resulting in a domestic distribution operating margin increase of 04 percentage points in 2006 

general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses decreased 159 million or 85 in 2006 as a percentage of total revenues general and administrative expenses decreased 04 percentage points to 119 in 2006 these decreases were due primarily to a gain of approximately 28 million recognized on the sale of companyowned operations in france and the netherlands in 2006 a reduction of general and administrative expenses of approximately 54 million resulting from the absence of these operations during the second half of 2006 and the positive impact in 2006 related to the 28 million of charges incurred in the fourth quarter of 2005 related to a goodwill impairment charge and losses on store sales additionally general and administrative expenses were positively impacted by decreases in variable general and administrative expenses including lower administrative labor

domestic stores domestic stores revenues are comprised of retail sales from domestic companyowned store operations and royalties from retail sales at domestic franchise stores as summarized in the following table 

 

 domestic stores revenues increased 254 million or 47 in 2005 this increase was due primarily to a 49 increase in same store sales and an increase in domestic franchise store counts offset in part by the negative impact of the inclusion of the 53 rd week in 2004 these results are more fully described below

cost of sales  operating margin the consolidated operating margin which we define as revenues less cost of sales increased 316 million or 89 in 2005 as summarized in the following table 

 

 the 316 million increase in consolidated operating margin was due primarily to increases in royalties resulting from higher retail sales at both our domestic and international franchise stores and increases in the operating margins from both our domestic companyowned store and domestic distribution operations offset in part by the negative impact of the inclusion of the 53 rd week in 2004 franchise revenues do not have a cost of sales component and as a result increases in franchise revenues have a disproportionate effect on the consolidated operating margin 

as a percentage of total revenues our consolidated operating margin increased primarily as a result of the aforementioned increase in our domestic franchise operating margin and a market decrease in overall food prices primarily cheese which benefited both domestic companyowned store and domestic distribution operating margins as a percentage of revenues changes in the operating margin at our domestic companyowned store operations and our domestic distribution operations are more fully described below

additionally the domestic companyowned store operating margin as a percentage of store revenues was negatively impacted due to the inclusion of the 53 rd week in 2004 

domestic distribution the domestic distribution operating margin increased 67 million or 92 in 2005 as summarized in the following table 

 

 the 67 million increase in the domestic distribution operating margin was due primarily to increases in volumes and efficiencies in the areas of operations and purchasing offsetting these increases in part was the negative impact on the distribution operating margin from the inclusion of the 53 rd week in 2004 

as a percentage of distribution revenues our distribution operating margin increased primarily as a result of lower food prices including cheese the aforementioned increase in volumes and operational and purchasing efficiencies decreases in certain food prices including cheese have a positive effect on the distribution operating margin due to the fixed dollar margin earned by domestic distribution on certain food items including cheese had the 2005 cheese prices been in effect during 2004 the domestic distribution operating margin as a percentage of domestic distribution revenues would have been approximately 94 for 2004 resulting in a domestic distribution operating margin increase of 03 percentage points in 2005

liquidity and capital resources 

as of december 31 2006 we had working capital of 111 million and cash and cash equivalents of 382 million historically we have operated with minimal positive working capital or negative working capital primarily because our receivable collection periods and inventory turn rates are faster than the normal payment terms on our current liabilities we generally collect our receivables within three weeks from the date of the related sale and we generally experience 40 to 50 inventory turns per year in addition our sales are not typically seasonal which further limits our working capital requirements these factors coupled with significant and ongoing cash flows from operations which are primarily used to repay longterm debt pay dividends and invest in longterm assets reduce our working capital amounts our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations and availability of borrowings under our revolving credit facility we have historically funded capital expenditures and debt repayments from cash flows from operations and expect to in the future we did not have any material commitments for capital expenditures as of december 31 2006 

our advertising fund assets decreased 167 million from 356 million at january 1 2006 to 189 million at december 31 2006 this decrease was due primarily to decreases in same store sales and the timing of receipts and disbursements the company will continue to fund future marketing activities from our advertising fund 

as of december 31 2006 we had 7416 million of longterm debt of which 15 million was classified as a current liability during 2006 we borrowed 1000 million in additional term loan borrowings that along with cash from operations was used to repurchase approximately 56 million shares of our common stock for 1450 million during 2006 we repaid 600 million of these borrowings at december 31 2006 we had borrowings of 911 million available under our 1250 million revolving credit facility net of letters of credit issued of 339 million these letters of credit are primarily related to our insurance programs and distribution center leases borrowings under the revolving credit facility are available to fund our working capital requirements capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes 

cash provided by operating activities was 1330 million and 1412 million in 2006 and 2005 respectively the 82 million decrease was due primarily to a 212 million net change in operating assets and liabilities due primarily to the timing of payment of current operating liabilities and a 21 million decrease in net income these decreases were offset in part by a 163 million decrease in gains on the saledisposal of assets due primarily to the sale of an equity investment in an international master franchisee in 2005 

cash used in investing activities was 59 million in 2006 cash provided by investing activities was 01 million in 2005 the 60 million net change was due primarily to a 255 million decrease in proceeds from the sale of equity investments due to the sale of an equity investment in an international master franchisee in 2005 offset in part by a 105 million increase in proceeds from the sale of property plant and equipment due primarily from the sale of companyowned operations in france and the netherlands in 2006 and an 85 million decrease in capital expenditures due primarily to increased spending in 2005 related to the renovation of our world headquarters 

cash used in financing activities was 1558 million and 1146 million in 2006 and 2005 respectively the 412 million increase was due primarily to a 700 million increase in repurchases of common stock a 149 million increase in repayments of longterm debt and capital lease obligations and a 164 million decrease in tax benefit from the exercise of stock options these increases in cash used in financing activities were offset in part by a 600 million increase in proceeds from the issuance of longterm debt 

on june 25 2003 we consummated a recapitalization transaction whereby domino’s inc i issued and sold 4030 million aggregate principal amount at maturity of 8 14  senior subordinated notes due 2011 at a discount resulting in gross proceeds of approximately 4001 million and ii borrowed 6100 million in term loans and secured a 1250 million revolving credit facility from a consortium of banks collectively the “senior secured credit facility” the senior secured credit facility was subsequently amended primarily to obtain more favorable interest rate margins to amend the principal amortization schedule to allow for the repayment of a portion of the senior subordinated notes as part of our ipo in lieu of a required payment under the senior secured credit facility to allow the payment of dividends to our stockholders and to allow for the purchase and retirement of common stock and to allow for additional term loan borrowings of 1000 million in 2006 

  

the senior subordinated notes require semiannual interest payments beginning january 1 2004 before july 1 2007 we may at a price above par redeem all but not part of the senior subordinated notes if a change in control occurs as defined in the indenture governing the notes beginning july 1 2007 we may redeem some or all of the senior subordinated notes at fixed redemption prices ranging from 104125 of par in 2007 to 100 of par in 2009 through maturity in the event of a change in control as defined we will be obligated to repurchase the senior subordinated notes tendered at the option of the holders at a fixed price upon a public stock offering we may use the net proceeds from such offering to repurchase and retire up to 40 of the aggregate principal amount of the senior subordinated notes due 2011 provided that at least 60 of the original principal amount of the senior subordinated notes due 2011 remains outstanding immediately following the repurchase during 2004 we used the net proceeds from our ipo to redeem approximately 1091 million in principal amount of our senior subordinated notes the senior subordinated notes are guaranteed by most of domino’s inc’s domestic subsidiaries and one foreign subsidiary and are subordinated in right of payment to all existing and future senior debt of the company 

the senior secured credit facility provides the following credit facilities a term loan and a revolving credit facility the initial aggregate borrowings available under the senior secured credit facility were 7350 million the senior secured credit facility provided borrowings of 6100 million in term loans the term loan was initially fully borrowed term loans outstanding as of december 31 2006 were 4630 million borrowings under the term loan bear interest payable at least quarterly at either i the higher of a the prime rate 825 at december 31 2006 and b 050 above the federal reserve reported overnight funds rate each plus an applicable margin of 050 or ii libor 5375 at december 31 2006 plus an applicable margin of 150 at december 31 2006 our borrowing rate was 6875 for term loan borrowings as of december 31 2006 all borrowings under the term loan were under a libor contract with an interest period of 90 days 

as of december 31 2006 the senior secured credit facility requires term loan payments of 12 million 48 million 60 million and 4511 million in 2007 2008 2009 and 2010 respectively the timing of our required payments under the senior secured credit facility may change based upon voluntary prepayments and generation of excess cash flow we are required to pay between 25 and 75 of the excess cash flow generated the required percentage is determined once a year and is based on our leverage ratio at the end of the preceding year excess cash flow is calculated as i earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization less ii the sum of debt repayments capital expenditures cash interest expense provision for current taxes and certain other adjustments if any which have historically included our 2003 recapitalization transaction expenses comprised of bond tender fees and financing fees and our 2004 ipo expenses comprised primarily of the payment made to an affiliate of our former majority stockholder in connection with the termination of its management agreement with us total debt is divided by the amount in clause i to calculate the leverage ratio if the leverage ratio is over 40 between 40 and 325 or less than 325 we are obligated to pay 75 50 or 25 of the excess cash flows amounts generated respectively the required percentage for 2006 to be paid in 2007 was 25 however no payment was required in 2007 because there is no excess cash flow as calculated as we voluntarily prepaid a significant amount of term loans during 2006 upon a public stock offering we are required to pay down the term loan in an amount equal to 50 of the net proceeds of such offering 

in connection with our ipo we amended our senior secured credit facility and obtained consent under the facility to permit the use of proceeds described in our offering prospectus filed with the securities and exchange commission the final scheduled principal payment on the outstanding borrowings under the term loan is due in june 2010 

the senior secured credit facility also provides for borrowings of up to 1250 million under the revolving credit facility of which up to 600 million is available for letter of credit advances borrowings under the revolving credit facility excluding letters of credit bear interest payable at least quarterly at either i the higher of a the prime rate and b 050 above the federal reserve reported overnight funds rate each plus an applicable margin of between 125 to 200 or ii libor plus an applicable margin of between 225 to 300 with margins determined based upon our ratio of indebtedness to ebitda as defined we also pay a 050 commitment fee on the unused portion of the revolver the fee for letter of credit amounts outstanding ranges from 2375 to 3125 at december 31 2006 the fee for letter of credit amounts outstanding was 2375 at december 31 2006 there was 911 million in available borrowings under the revolving credit facility with 339 million of letters of credit outstanding the revolving credit facility expires in june 2009 

in 2007 and in connection with the proposed transactions we entered into a fiveyear forwardstarting interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of 125 billion this swap was entered into to hedge the variability of future interest rates in contemplation of the bridge loan and securitized debt in connection with the recapitalization 

  

based upon our current level of operations and anticipated growth we believe that the cash generated from our operations and amounts available under our revolving credit facility will be adequate to meet our anticipated debt service requirements including payments required under the excess cash flow provisions of our senior secured credit facility capital expenditures and working capital needs for the next several years we believe that we will be able to meet these obligations even if we experience no growth in sales or profits our ability to continue to fund these items and continue to reduce debt could be adversely affected by the occurrence of any of the events described in item 1a risk factors there can be no assurance however that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operations or that future borrowings will be available under our revolving credit facility or otherwise to enable us to service our indebtedness including our senior secured credit facility and senior subordinated notes or to make anticipated capital expenditures our future operating performance and our ability to service or refinance the senior subordinated notes and to service extend or refinance the senior secured credit facility will be subject to future economic conditions and to financial business and other factors many of which are beyond our control 

impact of inflation 

we believe that our results of operations are not materially impacted upon moderate changes in the inflation rate inflation and changing prices did not have a material impact on our operations in 2004 2005 or 2006 severe increases in inflation however could affect the global and us economies and could have an adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk 

we are exposed to market risks from interest rate changes on our variable rate debt management actively monitors this exposure we do not engage in speculative transactions nor do we hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes 

we are also exposed to market risks from changes in commodity prices during the normal course of business we purchase cheese and certain other food products that are affected by changes in commodity prices and as a result we are subject to volatility in our food costs we may periodically enter into financial instruments to manage this risk 

we purchase cheese at market prices which fluctuate on a daily basis the cheese block price per pound averaged 150 and 124 in 2005 and 2006 respectively the estimated change in companyowned store food costs from a hypothetical 025 change in the average cheese block price per pound would have been approximately 39 million in 2006 this hypothetical change in food cost could be positively or negatively impacted by average ticket changes and product mix changes 

financial derivatives 

we enter into interest rate swaps collars or similar instruments with the objective of reducing volatility relating to our borrowing costs in addition to fulfilling requirements under our debt agreements 

as of december 31 2006 we were party to two interest rate swap agreements which effectively convert the fixed interest component on a portion of the debt under our senior subordinated notes to variable liborbased rates over the term of the senior subordinated notes we are also party to an interest rate swap agreement which effectively converts the variable libor component of the effective interest rate on a portion of our debt under our senior secured credit facility to a fixed rate over the stated term these agreements are summarized in the following table 

 

 on february 7 2007 we announced a recapitalization plan that if successful would include the repurchase of all of our outstanding senior subordinated notes and the repayment of all borrowings under our senior credit facility at the time of these repayments we intend to settle our positions in the above derivatives 

in 2007 we entered into a fiveyear forwardstarting interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of 125 billion this swap was entered into to hedge the variability of future interest rates in contemplation of the bridge loan and securitized debt in connection with the recapitalization 

interest rate risk 

our variable interest expense is sensitive to changes in the general level of interest rates as of december 31 2006 the weighted average interest rate on our 2630 million of variable interest debt which is net of related outstanding derivative instruments was 75 

we had total interest expense of approximately 550 million in 2006 the estimated increase in interest expense for this period from a hypothetical 200 basis point adverse change in applicable variable interest rates would be approximately 52 million 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

we have exposure to various foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations for revenues generated by our operations outside the united states which can adversely impact our net income and cash flows approximately 81 86 and 86 of our total revenues in 2004 2005 and 2006 respectively were derived from sales to customers and royalties from franchisees outside the contiguous united states this business is conducted in the local currency we do not enter into financial instruments to manage this foreign currency exchange risk

 item 1 business 

overview 

domino’s pizza inc referred to as the “company” “domino’s” or in the first person notations of “we” “us” and “our” is the number one pizza delivery company in the united states based on reported consumer spending and has a leading presence internationally we pioneered the pizza delivery business and have built the domino’s pizza ® brand into one of the most widelyrecognized consumer brands in the world together with our franchisees we have supported the domino’s pizza ® brand with an estimated 13 billion in domestic advertising spending over the past five years we operate through a network of 8079 companyowned and franchise stores located in all 50 states and in more than 50 countries in addition we operate 17 regional dough manufacturing and distribution centers in the contiguous united states and eight dough manufacturing and distribution centers outside the contiguous united states the foundation of our systemwide success and leading market position is our strong relationship with our franchisees comprised of approximately 2000 owneroperators dedicated to the success of our company and the domino’s pizza ® brand 

over our 45year history we have developed a simple business model focused on our core strength of delivering quality pizza in a timely manner this business model includes a deliveryoriented store design with low capital requirements a focused menu of pizza and complementary side items committed owneroperator franchisees and a verticallyintegrated distribution system our earnings are driven largely from retail sales at our franchise stores which generate royalty payments and distribution revenues to us we also generate earnings through retail sales at our companyowned stores 

we operate our business in three segments domestic stores domestic distribution and international 

• domestic stores the domestic stores segment which is comprised of 4511 franchise stores and 581 companyowned stores generated revenues of 5629 million and income from operations of 1489 million during 2005 

• domestic distribution our domestic distribution segment which manufactures dough and distributes food and supplies to all of our domestic companyowned stores and over 98 of our domestic franchise stores generated revenues of 8191 million and income from operations of 530 million during 2005 

• international our international segment oversees 2980 franchise stores and operates 7 companyowned stores outside the contiguous united states it also manufactures dough and distributes food and supplies in a limited number of these markets our international segment generated revenues of 1296 million and income from operations of 369 million during 2005 

on a consolidated basis we generated revenues of more than 15 billion and income from operations after deducting 397 million of unallocated corporate and other expenses of 1991 million in 2005 net income was 1083 million in 2005 we have been able to increase our income from operations more than 55 over the past five years through strong domestic and international same store sales growth the addition of over 1100 stores worldwide over that time and strong performance by our distribution business over this same time period we increased our net income in each year except 2003 during which we incurred significant recapitalizationrelated expenses this growth was achieved with limited capital expenditures by us since a significant portion of our earnings are derived from retail sales by our franchisees 

our history 

we have been delivering quality affordable pizza to our customers since 1960 when brothers thomas and james monaghan borrowed 900 and purchased a small pizza store in ypsilanti michigan since that time our store count and geographic reach have grown substantially we opened our first franchise store in 1967 our first international store in 1983 and by 1998 we had expanded to over 6200 stores including more than 1700 international stores on six continents during 2005 we opened our 8000 th store worldwide 

in 1998 an investor group led by investment funds affiliated with bain capital llc completed a recapitalization through which the investor group acquired a 93 controlling economic interest in our company from thomas monaghan and his family at the time of the recapitalization mr monaghan retired and in march 1999 david a brandon was named our chairman and chief executive officer in 2004 domino’s pizza inc completed its initial public offering the “ipo” and now trades on the new york stock exchange under the ticker symbol “dpz” 

  

industry overview 

in this document we rely on and refer to information regarding the us quick service restaurant or qsr sector the us qsr pizza category and its components and competitors including us from the crest report prepared by the npd group as well as market research reports analyst reports and other publiclyavailable information although we believe this information to be reliable we have not independently verified it domestic sales information relating to the qsr sector us qsr pizza category and us pizza delivery and carryout represent reported consumer spending obtained by the npd group’s crest report from consumer surveys this information relates to both our companyowned and franchise stores unless otherwise indicated all us industry data included in this document is based on reported consumer spending obtained by the npd group’s crest report from consumer surveys 

the us qsr pizza category is large growing and highly fragmented with sales of 334 billion in the twelve months ended november 2005 the us qsr pizza category is the second largest category within the 2064 billion us qsr sector the us qsr pizza category is primarily comprised of delivery dinein and carryout 

we operate primarily within us pizza delivery its 118 billion of sales accounted for 35 of total us qsr pizza category sales in the twelve months ended november 2005 we and our top two competitors account for approximately 46 of us pizza delivery based on reported consumer spending with the remaining 54 attributable to regional chains and individual establishments 

we also compete in carryout which together with pizza delivery are the largest components of the us qsr pizza category us carryout pizza had 133 billion of sales in the twelve months ended november 2005 and while our primary focus is on pizza delivery we are also favorably positioned to compete in carryout given our strong brand convenient store locations and quality affordable menu offerings 

total sales in the us pizza delivery and carryout components grew by 23 during the twelve months ended november 2005 we believe that this growth is the result of wellestablished demographic and lifestyle trends driving increased consumer emphasis on convenience 

in contrast to the united states international pizza delivery is relatively underdeveloped with only domino’s and one other competitor having a significant multinational presence we believe that demand for international pizza delivery is large and growing driven by international consumers’ increasing emphasis on convenience 

our competitive strengths 

we believe that our competitive strengths include the following 

• strong and proven growth and earnings model over our 45year history we have developed a focused growth and earnings model this model is anchored by strong storelevel economics which provide an entrepreneurial incentive for our franchisees and generate demand for new stores our franchise system in turn has produced strong and consistent earnings for us through royalty payments and distribution revenues with minimal associated capital expenditures by us 

• strong storelevel economics  we have developed a costefficient store model characterized by a delivery and carryout oriented store design with low capital requirements and a focused menu of quality affordable pizza and complementary side items at the store level we believe that the simplicity and efficiency of our operations give us significant advantages over our competitors who in many cases also focus on dinein 

our domestic stores and most of our international stores do not offer dinein areas and thus do not require expensive restaurant facilities and staffing in addition our focused menu of pizza and complementary side items simplifies and streamlines our production and delivery processes and maximizes economies of scale on purchases of our principal ingredients as a result of our focused business model and menu our stores are small averaging approximately 1000 to 1300 square feet and inexpensive to build furnish and maintain as compared to many other qsr franchise opportunities the combination of this efficient store model and strong store sales volume has resulted in strong storelevel financial returns and makes domino’s pizza an attractive business opportunity for existing and prospective franchisees 

  

• strong and welldiversified franchise system  we have developed a large global diversified and committed franchise network that is a critical component of our systemwide success and our leading position in pizza delivery as of january 1 2006 our franchise store network consisted of 7491 stores 60 of which were located in the contiguous united states in the united states only five franchisees operate more than 50 stores including our largest domestic franchisee which operates 136 stores our domestic franchisees on average operate between three and four stores we require our domestic franchisees to forego active outside business endeavors aligning their interests with ours and making the success of each domino’s pizza franchise of critical importance to our franchisees 

in addition we share 50 of the pretax profits generated by our regional dough manufacturing and distribution centers with those domestic franchisees who agree to purchase all of their food from our distribution system these arrangements strengthen our ties with our franchisees by enhancing their profitability while providing us with a continuing source of revenues and earnings this arrangement also provides incentives for franchisees to work closely with us to reduce costs we believe our strong mutuallybeneficial franchisee relationships are evidenced by the over 98 voluntary participation in our domestic distribution system our over 99 domestic franchise contract renewal rate and our over 99 collection rate on domestic franchise royalty and domestic distribution receivables 

internationally we have also been able to grow our franchise network by attracting franchisees with business experience and local market knowledge we generally use our master franchise model which provides our international franchisees with exclusive rights to operate stores or subfranchise our wellrecognized domino’s pizza ® brand name in specific agreedupon market areas from yearend 2000 through 2005 we grew our international franchise network 38 from 2157 stores to 2980 stores our largest master franchisee operates 555 stores which accounts for approximately 19 of our total international store count 

• strong cash flow and earnings stream  a substantial percentage of our earnings are generated by our committed owneroperator franchisees through royalty payments and revenues to our verticallyintegrated distribution system royalty payments yield strong profitability to us because there are minimal corresponding companylevel expenses and capital requirements associated with their collection 

we believe that our store economics have led to a strong welldiversified franchise system this established franchise system has produced strong cash flow and earnings for us enabling us to invest in the domino’s pizza ® brand and our stores pay a significant dividend repurchase shares of our common stock delever our balance sheet and deliver attractive returns to our stockholders 

• 1 pizza delivery company in the united states with a leading international presence  we are the number one pizza delivery company in the united states with a 194 share based on reported consumer spending with 5092 stores located in the contiguous united states our domestic store delivery areas cover a majority of us households our share position and scale allow us to leverage our purchasing power distribution strength and advertising investment across our store base we also believe that our scale and market coverage allow us to effectively serve our customers’ demands for convenience and timely delivery 

outside the united states we have significant share positions in the key markets in which we compete including among other countries mexico where we are the largest qsr company in terms of store count in any qsr category the united kingdom australia south korea canada japan taiwan and india our top ten international markets based on store count accounted for approximately 82 of our international retail sales in 2005 we believe we have a leading presence in these markets 

• strong brand awareness we believe our domino’s pizza ® brand is one of the most widelyrecognized consumer brands in the world we believe consumers associate our brand with the timely delivery of quality affordable pizza and complementary side items over the past five years our domestic franchise and companyowned stores have invested an estimated 13 billion on national local and cooperative advertising in the united states our domino’s pizza ® brand has been routinely named a megabrand by advertising age  we continue to reinforce our brand with extensive advertising through television radio and print we also enhance the strength of our brand through marketing affiliations with brands such as cocacola ® and nascar ®  

according to industry research reports approximately 90 of pizza consumers in the us are aware of the domino’s pizza ® brand we believe that our brand is particularly strong among pizza consumers for whom dinner is a fairly spontaneous event in these situations we believe that service and product quality are the consumers’ priorities we believe that wellestablished demographic and lifestyle trends will drive continuing emphasis on convenience and will therefore continue to play into our brand’s strength 

  

• our internal dough manufacturing and distribution system in addition to generating significant revenues and earnings we believe that our verticallyintegrated dough manufacturing and distribution system enhances the quality and consistency of our products enhances our relationships with franchisees leverages economies of scale to offer lower costs to our stores and allows our store managers to better focus on store operations and customer service by relieving them of the responsibility of mixing dough in the stores 

in 2005 we made approximately 656000 fullservice food deliveries to our domestic stores or between two and three deliveries per store per week with a delivery accuracy rate of approximately 99 all of our domestic companyowned and over 98 of our domestic franchise stores purchase all of their food and supplies from us this is accomplished through our network of 17 regional dough manufacturing and distribution centers each of which is generally located within a oneday delivery radius of the stores it serves and a leased fleet of over 200 tractors and trailers additionally we supply our domestic and international franchisees with equipment and supplies through our equipment and supply distribution center which we operate as part of our domestic distribution segment our equipment and supply distribution center sells and delivers a full range of products including ovens and uniforms on a daily basis we also supply certain of our domestic stores with ingredients that are processed at our vegetable processing distribution center which we operate as part of our domestic distribution segment 

because we source the food for substantially all of our domestic stores our domestic distribution segment enables us to leverage and monitor our strong supplier relationships to achieve the cost benefits of scale and to ensure compliance with our rigorous quality standards in addition the “onestop shop” nature of this system combined with our delivery accuracy allows our store managers to eliminate a significant component of the typical “backofstore” activity that many of our competitors’ store managers must undertake 

our business strategy 

we intend to achieve further growth and strengthen our competitive position through the continued implementation of our business strategy which includes the following key elements 

• continue to execute on our mission statement our mission statement is “exceptional people on a mission to be the best pizza delivery company in the world” we implement this mission statement by focusing on four strategic initiatives 

• peoplefirst  attract and retain highquality company employees who we refer to as team members with the goals of reducing turnover and maintaining continuity in the workforce we continually strive to achieve this objective through a combination of performancebased compensation for our nonhourly team members learning and development programs and team member ownership opportunities to promote our entrepreneurial spirit 

• build the brand  strengthen and build upon our strong brand name to further solidify our position as the brand of first choice in pizza delivery we continually strive to achieve this objective through product and process innovation consumer value news advertising and promotional campaigns and a strong brand message 

• maintain high standards  elevate and maintain quality throughout the entire domino’s system with the goals of making quality and consistency a competitive advantage controlling costs and supporting our stores we believe that our comprehensive store audits and verticallyintegrated distribution system help us to consistently achieve high quality of operations across our system in a costefficient manner 

• flawless execution  perfect operations with the goals of making quality products attaining consistency in execution maintaining the best operating model making our team members a competitive advantage operating stores with smart hustle and aligning us with our franchisees 

• grow our leading position in an attractive industry us pizza delivery and carryout are the largest components of the us qsr pizza category and collectively grew 23 during the twelve months ended november 2005 these pizza category components are also highly fragmented pizza delivery through which a majority of our retail sales are generated had sales of 118 billion in the twelve months ended november 2005 as the leader in us pizza delivery we believe that our convenient store locations simple operating model widelyrecognized brand and efficient distribution system are competitive advantages that position us to capitalize on future growth 

carryout had 133 billion of sales in the twelve months ended november 2005 while our primary focus is on pizza delivery we are also favorably positioned as a leader in carryout given our strong brand convenient store locations and quality affordable menu offerings 

  

• leverage our strong brand awareness we believe that the strength of our domino’s pizza ® brand makes us one of the first choices of consumers seeking a convenient quality and affordable meal we intend to continue to promote our brand name and enhance our reputation as the leader in pizza delivery for example we intend to continue to promote our successful advertising campaign “get the door it’s domino’s ® ” through national local and cooperative media in 2005 each of our domestic stores contributed 4 of their retail sales to our advertising fund for national advertising in addition to contributions for marketlevel advertising additionally for 2006 our domestic stores within active cooperatives elected to allocate an additional 1 of their advertising contributions to support national advertising initiatives 

we intend to leverage our strong brand by continuing to introduce innovative consumertested and profitable new pizza varieties such as domino’s steak fanatic pizza™ complementary side items such as buffalo wings cheesy bread domino’s buffalo chicken kickers ® and cinna stix ®  and value promotions such as the domino’s 555 deal as well as through marketing affiliations with brands such as cocacola ® and nascar ®  we believe these opportunities when coupled with our scale and share leadership will allow us to continue to grow our position in us pizza delivery 

• expand and optimize our domestic store base we plan to continue expanding our base of domestic stores to take advantage of the attractive growth opportunities in us pizza delivery we believe that our scale allows us to expand our store base with limited marketing distribution and other incremental infrastructure costs additionally our franchiseoriented business model allows us to expand our store base with limited capital expenditures and working capital requirements while we plan to expand our traditional domestic store base primarily through opening new franchise stores we will also continually evaluate our mix of companyowned and franchise stores and strategically acquire franchise stores and refranchise companyowned stores 

• continue to grow our international business we believe that pizza has global appeal and that there is strong and growing international demand for delivered pizza we have successfully built a broad international platform almost exclusively through our master franchise model as evidenced by our 2987 international stores in more than 50 countries we believe that we continue to have significant longterm growth opportunities in international markets where we have established a leading presence in our current top ten international markets we believe that our store base is less than half of the total longterm potential store base in those markets generally we believe we will achieve longterm growth internationally as a result of the favorable storelevel economics of our business model the growing international demand for delivered pizza and the strong global recognition of the domino’s pizza ® brand our international stores have produced positive quarterly same store sales growth for 48 consecutive quarters 

store operations 

we believe that our focused and proven store model provides a significant competitive advantage relative to many of our competitors who focus on multiple components of the pizza category particularly dinein we have been focused on pizza delivery for 45 years because our domestic stores and most of our international stores do not offer dinein areas they typically do not require expensive real estate are relatively small and are relatively inexpensive to build and equip our stores also benefit from lower maintenance costs as store assets have long lives and updates are not frequently required our simple and efficient operational processes which we have refined through continuous improvement include 

• strategic store locations to facilitate delivery service 

• productionoriented store designs 

• product and process innovations 

• a focused menu 

• efficient order taking production and delivery 

• domino’s pulse ™ pointofsale system and 

• a comprehensive store audit program 

strategic store locations to facilitate delivery service 

we locate our stores strategically to facilitate timely delivery service to our customers the majority of our domestic stores are located in populated areas in or adjacent to large or midsize cities or on or near college campuses we use geographic information software which incorporates variables such as traffic volumes competitor locations household demographics and visibility to evaluate and identify potential store locations and new markets 

  

productionoriented store designs 

our typical store is relatively small occupying approximately 1000 to 1300 square feet and is designed with a focus on efficient and timely production of consistent quality pizza for delivery the store layout has been refined over time to provide an efficient flow from order taking to delivery our stores are primarily production facilities and accordingly do not typically have a dinein area 

product and process innovations 

our 45 years of experience and innovative culture have resulted in numerous new product and process developments that increase both quality and efficiency these include our efficient verticallyintegrated distribution system a sturdier corrugated pizza box and a mesh tray that helps cook pizza crust more evenly the domino’s heatwave ® hot bag which was introduced in 1998 keeps our pizzas hot during delivery we also continue to introduce new pizzas on a limited time only basis such as domino’s steak fanatic pizza ™ that we launched in 2005 additionally we have added a number of complementary side items to our menu such as buffalo wings domino’s buffalo chicken kickers ®  bread sticks cheesy bread and cinna stix ®  

focused menu 

we maintain a focused menu that is designed to present an attractive quality offering to customers while minimizing order errors and expediting the order taking and food preparation processes our basic menu has three choices pizza type pizza size and pizza toppings most of our stores carry two sizes of traditional handtossed ultimate deep dish and crunchy thin crust pizza our typical store also offers buffalo wings domino’s buffalo chicken kickers ®  bread sticks cheesy bread cinna stix ® and cocacola ® soft drink products we also occasionally offer other products on a promotional basis we believe that our focused menu creates a strong identity among consumers improves operating efficiency and maintains food quality and consistency 

efficient order taking production and delivery 

each store executes an operational process that includes order taking pizza preparation cooking via automated conveyordriven ovens boxing and delivery the entire order taking and pizza production process is designed for completion in approximately 1215 minutes these operational processes are supplemented by an extensive employee training program designed to ensure worldclass quality and customer service it is our priority to ensure that every domino’s store operates in an efficient consistent manner while maintaining our high standards of food quality and team member safety 

domino’s pulse ™ pointofsale system 

our computerized management information systems are designed to improve operating efficiencies provide corporate management with timely access to financial and marketing data and reduce store and corporate administrative time and expense we have installed domino’s pulse™ our proprietary pointofsale system in every companyowned store in the united states some enhanced features of domino’s pulse™ over our previous pointofsale system include 

• touch screen ordering which improves accuracy and facilitates more efficient order taking 

• a delivery driver routing system which improves delivery efficiency 

• improved administrative and reporting capabilities which enable store managers to better focus on store operations and customer satisfaction and 

• a customer relationship management tool which enables us to recognize customers and track ordering preferences 

we are requiring our domestic franchisees to install domino’s pulse ™ by june 2008 

comprehensive store audit program 

we utilize a comprehensive store audit program to ensure that our stores are meeting both our stringent standards as well as the expectations of our customers the audit program focuses primarily on the quality of the pizza a store is producing the outthedoor time and the condition of the store as viewed by the customer we believe that this store audit program is an integral part of our strategy to maintain high standards in our stores 

  

segment overview 

we operate in three business segments 

• domestic stores our domestic stores segment consists of our domestic franchise operations which oversee our network of 4511 franchise stores located in the contiguous united states and our domestic companyowned store operations which operate our network of 581 companyowned stores located in the contiguous united states 

• domestic distribution our domestic distribution segment operates 17 regional dough manufacturing and food distribution centers one distribution center providing equipment and supplies to certain of our domestic and international stores and one vegetable processing distribution center and 

• international our international segment oversees our network of 2980 international franchise stores in more than 50 countries operates 5 companyowned stores in the netherlands and 2 companyowned stores in france our international segment also distributes food to a limited number of markets from eight dough manufacturing and distribution centers in alaska hawaii canada four the netherlands and france 

domestic stores 

during 2005 our domestic stores segment accounted for 5629 million or 37 of our consolidated revenues our domestic franchises are operated by entrepreneurs who own and operate an average of three to four stores only five of our domestic franchisees operate more than 50 stores including our largest domestic franchisee which operates 136 stores our principal sources of revenues from domestic store operations are companyowned store sales and royalty payments based on retail sales by our franchisees our domestic network of companyowned stores also plays an important strategic role in our predominantly franchised operating structure in addition to generating revenues and earnings we use our domestic companyowned stores as a test site for new products and promotions as well as store operational improvements and as a forum for training new store managers and prospective franchisees we also believe that our domestic companyowned stores add to the economies of scale available for advertising marketing and other costs that are primarily borne by our franchisees while we continue to be a primarily franchised business we continually evaluate our mix of domestic companyowned and franchise stores in an effort to optimize our profitability 

our domestic companyowned store operations are divided into eleven geographic areas located throughout the contiguous united states while our domestic franchise operations are divided into two regional offices located in california and georgia our team members within these areas provide direct supervision over our domestic companyowned stores provide training store operational audits and marketing services and provide financial analysis and store development services to our franchisees we maintain a close relationship with our franchise stores through regional franchise teams an array of computerbased training materials that help franchise stores comply with our standards and franchise advisory groups that facilitate communications between us and our franchisees 

domestic distribution 

during 2005 our domestic distribution segment accounted for 8191 million or 54 of our consolidated revenues our domestic distribution segment is comprised of dough manufacturing and distribution centers that manufacture fresh dough on a daily basis and purchase receive store and deliver quality pizzarelated food products and complementary side items to all of our companyowned stores and over 98 of our domestic franchise stores each regional dough manufacturing and distribution center serves approximately 290 stores generally located within a oneday delivery radius we regularly supply more than 5000 stores with various supplies and ingredients of which nine product groups account for nearly 90 of the volume our domestic distribution segment made approximately 656000 fullservice deliveries in 2005 or between two and three deliveries per store per week and we produced nearly 400 million pounds of dough during 2005 

we believe that our franchisees voluntarily choose to obtain food supplies and equipment from us because we provide the most efficient convenient and costeffective alternative while also providing both quality and consistency in addition our domestic distribution segment offers a profitsharing arrangement to stores that purchase all of their food from our domestic dough manufacturing and distribution centers this profitsharing arrangement provides domestic companyowned stores and participating franchisees with 50 of their regional distribution center’s pretax profits profits are shared with the franchisees based upon each franchisee’s purchases from our distribution centers we believe these arrangements strengthen our ties with these franchisees 

  

the information systems used by our domestic dough manufacturing and distribution centers are an integral part of the quality service we provide our stores we use routing strategies and software to optimize our daily delivery schedules which maximizes ontime deliveries through our strategic dough manufacturing and distribution center locations and proven routing systems we achieved ontime delivery rates of approximately 99 during 2005 our distribution center drivers unload food and supplies and stock store shelves typically during nonpeak store hours which minimizes disruptions in store operations

during 2005 our international segment accounted for 1296 million or 9 of our consolidated revenues we have 529 franchise stores in mexico representing the largest presence of any qsr company in mexico 383 franchise stores in the united kingdom 365 franchise stores in australia 267 franchise stores in south korea 252 franchise stores in canada and over 100 franchise stores in each of japan taiwan and india the principal sources of revenues from our international operations are royalty payments generated by retail sales from franchise stores sales of food and supplies to franchisees in certain markets and companyowned store retail sales 

we have grown by more than 800 international stores over the past five years while our stores are designed for delivery and carryout which are less capitalintensive than dinein we empower our managers and franchisees to adapt the standard operating model within certain parameters to satisfy the local eating habits and consumer preferences of various regions outside the contiguous united states currently most of our international stores are operated under master franchise agreements and we plan to continue entering into master franchise agreements with qualified franchisees to expand our international operations in selected countries we believe that our international franchise stores appeal to potential franchisees because of our wellrecognized brand name the limited capital expenditures required to open and operate our stores and our system’s favorable store economics the following table shows our store count as of january 1 2006 in our top ten international markets which account for 78 of our international stores 

 

 our franchise program 

as of january 1 2006 our 4511 domestic franchise stores were owned and operated by our 1279 domestic franchisees the success of our franchise formula which enables franchisees to benefit from our brand name with a relatively low initial capital investment has attracted a large number of motivated entrepreneurs as franchisees as of january 1 2006 the average domestic franchisee operated approximately three to four stores and had been in our franchise system for nearly eleven years at the same time only five of our domestic franchisees operated more than 50 stores including our largest domestic franchisee which operates 136 stores 

domestic franchisees 

we apply rigorous standards to prospective franchisees we generally require prospective domestic franchisees to manage a store for at least one year before being granted a franchise this enables us to observe the operational and financial performance of a potential franchisee prior to entering into a longterm contract we also restrict the ability of domestic franchisees to become involved in other businesses which focuses our franchisees’ attention on operating their stores as a result the vast majority of our franchisees come from within the domino’s pizza system we believe these standards are unique to the franchise industry and result in qualified and focused franchisees operating their stores 

  

franchise agreements 

we enter into franchise agreements with domestic franchisees under which the franchisee is granted the right to operate a store in a particular location for a term of ten years with options to renew for an additional term of ten years we currently have a franchise contract renewal rate of over 99 under the current standard franchise agreement we assign an exclusive area of primary responsibility to each franchise store during the term of the franchise agreement the franchisee is required to pay a 55 royalty fee on sales subject in limited instances to lower rates based on area development agreements sales initiatives and new store incentives we have the contractual right subject to state law to terminate a franchise agreement for a variety of reasons including but not limited to a franchisee’s failure to make required payments when due or failure to adhere to specified company policies and standards 

franchise store development 

we provide domestic franchisees with assistance in selecting store sites and conforming the space to the physical specifications required for a domino’s pizza store each domestic franchisee selects the location and design for each store subject to our approval based on accessibility and visibility of the site and demographic factors including population density and anticipated traffic levels we provide design plans and sell fixtures and equipment for most of our franchise stores 

franchise training and support 

training store managers and employees is a critical component of our success we require all domestic franchisees to complete initial and ongoing training programs provided by us in addition under the standard domestic franchise agreement domestic franchisees are required to implement training programs for their store employees we assist our domestic and international franchisees by making training materials available to them for their use in training store managers and employees including computerbased training materials comprehensive operations manuals and franchise development classes we also maintain communications with our franchisees online and through various newsletters 

franchise operations 

we enforce stringent standards over franchise operations to protect the domino’s pizza ® brand name all franchisees are required to operate their stores in compliance with written policies standards and specifications which include matters such as menu items ingredients materials supplies services furnishings decor and signs each franchisee has full discretion to determine the prices to be charged to customers we also provide ongoing support to our franchisees including training marketing assistance and consultation to franchisees who experience financial or operational difficulties we have established several advisory boards through which franchisees contribute to developing systemwide initiatives 

international franchisees 

the vast majority of our markets outside of the contiguous united states are operated by master franchisees with franchise and distribution rights for entire regions or countries in select regions or countries we franchise directly to individual store operators our master franchise agreements generally grant the franchisee exclusive rights to develop or subfranchise stores and the right to operate distribution centers in a particular geographic area for a term of ten to 20 years with options to renew for additional terms the agreements typically contain growth clauses requiring franchisees to open a minimum number of stores within a specified period prospective master franchisees are required to possess or have access to local market knowledge required to establish and develop domino’s pizza stores the local market knowledge focuses on the ability to identify and access targeted real estate sites along with expertise in local customs culture consumer behavior and laws we also seek candidates that have access to sufficient capital to meet their growth and development plans the master franchisee is generally required to pay an initial onetime franchise fee based on the size of the market covered by the master franchise agreement as well as an additional franchise fee upon the opening of each new store in addition the master franchisee is required to pay a continuing royalty fee as a percentage of retail sales which varies among international markets 

  

marketing operations 

we require domestic stores to contribute 4 of their retail sales to fund national marketing and advertising campaigns also for 2006 our domestic stores within active cooperatives elected to allocate an additional 1 of their advertising contributions to support national advertising initiatives in addition to the required national advertising contributions in those markets where we have cooperative advertising programs our domestic stores also generally contribute for market level media campaigns these national and marketlevel funds are administered by domino’s national advertising fund inc or dnaf our notforprofit advertising subsidiary the funds remitted to dnaf are used primarily to purchase television advertising but also support market research field communications commercial production talent payments and other activities supporting the domino’s pizza ® brand dnaf also provides costeffective print materials to our domestic stores for use in local marketing that reinforce our national branding strategy in addition to the national and market level advertising contributions domestic stores spend additional amounts on local store marketing including targeted database mailings saturation print mailings and community involvement through school and civic organizations 

by communicating a common brand message at the national local market and store levels we create and reinforce a powerful consistent marketing message to consumers this is evidenced by our successful marketing campaign with the slogan “get the door it’s domino’s ® ” over the past five years we estimate that domestic stores have invested approximately 13 billion on national local and cooperative advertising 

internationally marketing efforts are primarily the responsibility of the franchisee in each local market we assist international franchisees with their marketing efforts through marketing workshops and knowledge sharing of best practices 

suppliers 

we have maintained active relationships of 15 years or more with more than half of our major suppliers our suppliers are required to meet strict quality standards to ensure food safety we review and evaluate our suppliers’ quality assurance programs through among other actions onsite visits to ensure compliance with our standards we believe that the length and quality of our relationships with suppliers provides us with priority service and quality products at competitive prices 

we believe that two factors have been critical to maintaining longlasting relationships and keeping our purchasing costs low first we are one of the largest domestic volume purchasers of pizzarelated products such as flour cheese sauce and pizza boxes which allows us to maximize leverage with our suppliers second we use a combination of singlesource and multisource procurement strategies each supply category is evaluated along a number of criteria including value of purchasing leverage consistency of quality and reliability of supply to determine the appropriate number of suppliers 

we currently purchase our mozzarella pizza cheese from a single supplier pursuant to a requirements contract that provides for pricing based on volume our cheese cost is based on the market price of cheese plus a supplier margin the supplier margin can be reduced if certain volume purchase levels are reached once a volume purchase level is reached the supplier margin is reduced and can only be further reduced in the future based upon attainment of higher volume purchase levels the supplier agreement is terminable by us upon 90 days prior written notice our chicken is also currently purchased from a single supplier the majority of our meat toppings come from another single supplier under a contract that began in july 2005 and will expire in december 2007 the crunchy thin crust dough is currently sourced by another single supplier pursuant to requirements contracts that expire in 2009 we have the right to terminate these requirements contracts for quality failures and for uncured breaches 

we believe that alternative suppliers for all of these ingredients are available and all of our pizza boxes sauces and other ingredients are sourced from various suppliers while we would likely incur additional costs if we are required to replace any of our suppliers we do not believe that such additional costs would have a material adverse effect on our business we also entered into a multiyear agreement with cocacola effective january 1 2003 for the contiguous united states the contract provides for cocacola to be our exclusive beverage supplier and expires on the later of december 31 2009 or such time as a minimum number of cases of cocacola ® products are purchased by us we continually evaluate each supply category to determine the optimal sourcing strategy 

we have not experienced any significant shortages of supplies or any delays in receiving our food or beverage inventories restaurant supplies or products prices charged to us by our suppliers are subject to fluctuation and we have historically been able to pass increased costs and savings on to our stores we do not engage in commodity hedging 

  

competition 

us and international pizza delivery and carryout are highly competitive domestically we compete against regional and local companies as well as national chains including pizza hut ® and papa john’s ®  internationally we compete against pizza hut ® and regional and local companies we generally compete on the basis of product quality location delivery time service and price we also compete on a broader scale with quick service and other international national regional and local restaurants in addition the overall food service industry and the qsr sector in particular are intensely competitive with respect to product quality price service convenience and concept the industry is often affected by changes in consumer tastes economic conditions demographic trends and consumers’ disposable income we compete within the food service industry and the qsr sector not only for customers but also for personnel suitable real estate sites and qualified franchisees 

government regulation 

we are subject to various federal state and local laws affecting the operation of our business as are our franchisees including various health sanitation fire and safety standards each store is subject to licensing and regulation by a number of governmental authorities which include zoning health safety sanitation building and fire agencies in the jurisdiction in which the store is located in connection with the reimaging of our stores we may be required to expend funds to meet certain federal state and local regulations including regulations requiring that remodeled or altered stores be accessible to persons with disabilities difficulties in obtaining or the failure to obtain required licenses or approvals could delay or prevent the opening of a new store in a particular area or cause an existing store to cease operations our distribution facilities are licensed and subject to similar regulations by federal state and local health and fire codes 

we are also subject to the fair labor standards act and various other federal and state laws governing such matters as minimum wage requirements overtime and other working conditions and citizenship requirements a significant number of our food service personnel are paid at rates related to the applicable minimum wage and past increases in the minimum wage have increased our labor costs as would future increases 

we are subject to the rules and regulations of the federal trade commission and various state laws regulating the offer and sale of franchises the federal trade commission and various state laws require that we furnish a franchise offering circular containing certain information to prospective franchisees and a number of states require registration of the franchise offering circular with state authorities we are operating under exemptions from registration in several states based on the net worth of our operating subsidiary domino’s pizza llc and experience substantive state laws that regulate the franchisorfranchisee relationship presently exist in a substantial number of states and bills have been introduced in congress from time to time that would provide for federal regulation of the franchisorfranchisee relationship the state laws often limit among other things the duration and scope of noncompetition provisions the ability of a franchisor to terminate or refuse to renew a franchise and the ability of a franchisor to designate sources of supply we believe that our uniform franchise offering circular together with any applicable state versions or supplements and franchising procedures comply in all material respects with both the federal trade commission guidelines and all applicable state laws regulating franchising in those states in which we have offered franchises 

internationally our franchise stores are subject to national and local laws and regulations that often are similar to those affecting our domestic stores including laws and regulations concerning franchises labor health sanitation and safety our international stores are also often subject to tariffs and regulations on imported commodities and equipment and laws regulating foreign investment we believe that our international disclosure statements franchise offering documents and franchising procedures comply in all material respects with the laws of the foreign countries in which we have offered franchises 

trademarks 

we have many registered trademarks and service marks and believe that the domino’s ® mark and domino’s pizza ® names and logos in particular have significant value and are important to our business our policy is to pursue registration of our trademarks and to vigorously oppose the infringement of any of our trademarks we license the use of our registered marks to franchisees through franchise agreements 

environmental matters 

we are not aware of any federal state or local environmental laws or regulations that will materially affect our earnings or competitive position or result in material capital expenditures however we cannot predict the effect of possible future environmental legislation or regulations during 2005 there were no material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities and no such material expenditures are anticipated in 2006 

  

employees 

as of january 1 2006 we had approximately 13500 employees who we refer to as team members in our companyowned stores distribution centers world resource center our corporate headquarters and regional offices as franchisees are independent business owners they and their employees are not included in our employee count we consider our relationship with our employees and franchisees to be good we estimate the total number of people who work in the domino’s pizza system including our employees franchisees and the employees of franchisees was approximately 160000 as of january 1 2006 

none of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement other than statutorily mandated programs in european countries where we operate 

safety 

our commitment to safety is embodied in our hiring training and review process before an applicant is considered for hire as a delivery driver in the united states motor vehicle records are reviewed to ensure a minimum safe driving record of one or two years in addition we require regular checks of driving records and proof of insurance for delivery drivers throughout their employment with us each domestic domino’s driver including drivers employed by franchisees must complete our safe delivery training program we have also implemented several safe driving incentive programs 

our safety and security department oversees security matters for our stores regional security and safety directors oversee security measures at store locations and assist local authorities in investigations of incidents involving our stores or personnel 

community activities 

we believe in supporting the communities we serve this is evidenced by our strong support of the domino’s pizza partners foundation the foundation is a separate notforprofit organization that was established in 1986 to assist domino’s pizza team members in times of tragedy and special need over the past three years we and our employees and franchisees contributed over 44 million to the foundation’s efforts and since its inception the foundation has supplied millions of dollars to team members in need 

from 2001 through march 2004 we had a national partnership with the makeawish foundation through this alliance we dedicated ourselves to deliver wishes to children with life threatening illnesses and assist the foundation with its benevolent volunteer efforts through heightened awareness and direct contributions under this commitment we satisfied the wishes of more than 25 children 

in july 2004 we announced a threeyear national charitable commitment to st jude children’s research hospital st jude was selected by our team members and franchisees through a global election process through a variety of internal and consumerbased activities including the 2005 thanks and giving program where we and our customers contributed over 12 million domino’s pizza has contributed 36 million either directly to st jude or to support programs designed to build awareness for the great work st jude does on behalf of children everywhere

research and development 

we operate research and product development facilities at our world resource center in ann arbor michigan companysponsored research and development activities which include among other things testing new products for possible menu additions are an important activity to us and our franchisees we do not consider the amounts we spend on research and development to be material

 item 1a risk factors 

risks relating to our business and industry 

the pizza category is highly competitive and such competition could adversely affect our operating results 

we compete in the united states against two national chains as well as many regional and local businesses we could experience increased competition from existing or new companies in the pizza category which could create increasing pressures to grow our business in order to maintain our market share if we are unable to maintain our competitive position we could experience downward pressure on prices lower demand for our products reduced margins the inability to take advantage of new business opportunities and the loss of market share all of which would have an adverse effect on our operating results and could cause our stock price to decline 

we also compete on a broader scale with quick service and other international national regional and local restaurants the overall food service market and the quick service restaurant sector are intensely competitive with respect to food quality price service convenience and concept and are often affected by changes in 

• consumer tastes 

• national regional or local economic conditions 

• disposable purchasing power 

• demographic trends and 

• currency fluctuations to the extent international operations are involved 

we compete within the food service market and the quick service restaurant sector not only for customers but also for management and hourly employees suitable real estate sites and qualified franchisees our domestic distribution segment is also subject to competition from outside suppliers if other suppliers who meet our qualification standards were to offer lower prices or better service to our franchisees for their ingredients and supplies and as a result our franchisees chose not to purchase from our domestic distribution centers our financial condition business and results of operations would be adversely affected 

if we fail to successfully implement our growth strategy which includes opening new domestic and international stores our ability to increase our revenues and operating profits could be adversely affected 

a significant component of our growth strategy is opening new domestic and international stores we and our franchisees face many challenges in opening new stores including among others 

• selection and availability of suitable store locations 

• negotiation of acceptable lease or financing terms 

• securing required domestic or foreign governmental permits and approvals and 

• employment and training of qualified personnel 

the opening of additional franchise stores also depends in part upon the availability of prospective franchisees who meet our criteria our failure to add a significant number of new stores would adversely affect our ability to increase revenues and operating income 

we are currently planning to expand our international operations in markets where we currently operate and in selected new markets this may require considerable management time as well as startup expenses for market development before any significant revenues and earnings are generated operations in new foreign markets may achieve low margins or may be unprofitable and expansion in existing markets may by affected by local economic and market conditions therefore as we expand internationally we may not experience the operating margins we expect our results of operations may be negatively impacted and our common stock price may decline 

we may also pursue strategic acquisitions as part of our business if we are able to identify acquisition candidates such acquisitions may be financed to the extent permitted under our debt agreements with substantial debt or with potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities 

the food service market is affected by consumer preferences and perceptions changes in these preferences and perceptions may lessen the demand for our products which would reduce sales and harm our business 

food service businesses are affected by changes in consumer tastes national regional and local economic conditions and demographic trends for instance if prevailing health or dietary preferences cause consumers to avoid pizza and other products we offer in favor of foods that are perceived as more healthy our business and operating results would be harmed moreover because we are primarily dependent on a single product if consumer demand for pizza should decrease our business would suffer more than if we had a more diversified menu as many other food service businesses do 

  

increases in food labor and other costs could adversely affect our profitability and operating results 

an increase in our operating costs could adversely affect our profitability factors such as inflation increased food costs increased labor and employee benefit costs and increased energy costs may adversely affect our operating costs most of the factors affecting costs are beyond our control and in many cases we may not be able to pass along these increased costs to our customers or franchisees most ingredients used in our pizza particularly cheese are subject to significant price fluctuations as a result of seasonality weather demand and other factors the cheese block price per pound averaged 150 in 2005 and the estimated increase in companyowned store food costs from a hypothetical 025 adverse change in the average cheese block price per pound would have been approximately 40 million in 2005 labor costs are largely a function of the minimum wage for a majority of our store and distribution center personnel and generally are a function of the availability of labor food including cheese costs and labor represent approximately 45 to 60 of a typical companyowned store’s cost of sales 

our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our business and limit our ability to plan for or respond to changes in our business 

in connection with our 1998 and 2003 recapitalizations we incurred a significant amount of indebtedness and we are currently highly leveraged as of january 1 2006 our consolidated longterm indebtedness was 7377 million our substantial indebtedness and the fact that a large portion of our cash flow from operations must be used to make principal and interest payments on our indebtedness could have important consequences to you for example they could 

• make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our debt agreements 

• increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions 

• require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow for other purposes 

• limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and the industry in which we operate thereby placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that may have less debt 

• limit by the financial and other restrictive covenants in our debt agreements our ability to borrow additional funds and 

• have a material adverse effect on us if we fail to comply with the covenants in our debt agreements because such failure could result in an event of default which if not cured or waived could result in a substantial amount of our indebtedness becoming immediately due and payable 

in addition our senior secured credit facility and the indenture governing domino’s inc’s senior subordinated notes permit us to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future including up to an additional 1250 million under our revolving credit facility as of january 1 2006 we had 1250 million available to us for additional borrowing under the revolving credit facility portion of our senior secured credit facility excluding outstanding letters of credit of 305 million if new indebtedness is added to our and our subsidiaries’ current debt levels the risks described above would intensify 

we may be unable to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our significant debt service obligations which would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

our ability to make principal and interest payments on and to refinance our indebtedness will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future this to a certain extent is subject to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control if our business does not generate sufficient cash flow from operations if currently anticipated cost savings and operating improvements are not realized on schedule in the amounts projected or at all or if future borrowings are not available to us under our senior secured credit facility in amounts sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected if we cannot generate sufficient cash flow from operations to make scheduled principal and interest payments on our debt obligations in the future we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity sell assets delay capital expenditures or seek additional equity if we are unable to refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all or to effect any other action relating to our indebtedness on satisfactory terms or at all our business may be harmed 

we may be unable to generate sufficient cash flow to pay quarterly dividends on our common stock 

our ability to pay a quarterly dividend on our common stock will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future this to a certain extent is subject to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control if our business does not generate sufficient cash flow from operations or if currently anticipated cost savings and operating improvements are not realized on schedule in the amounts projected or at all or if we are not in compliance with the terms of our debt agreements we may be unable to pay a quarterly dividend on our common stock 

  

the terms of the domino’s inc senior secured credit facility and senior subordinated notes have restrictive terms and our failure to comply with any of these terms could put us in default which would have an adverse effect on our business and prospects 

the senior secured credit facility and the indenture governing the senior subordinated notes in each case where our whollyowned subsidiary domino’s inc is the borrower contain a number of significant covenants these covenants limit domino’s inc’s ability and the ability of domino’s inc’s restricted subsidiaries to among other things 

• incur additional indebtedness and issue restricted subsidiary preferred stock 

• make capital expenditures and other investments 

• merge consolidate or dispose of our assets or the capital stock or assets of any restricted subsidiary 

• pay dividends make distributions or redeem capital stock 

• change our line of business 

• enter into transactions with our affiliates and 

• grant liens on our assets or the assets of our restricted subsidiaries 

the senior secured credit facility also requires us to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy financial condition tests at the end of each fiscal quarter these restrictions could affect our ability to pay dividends or repurchase shares of our common stock our ability to meet these financial ratios and tests can be affected by events beyond our control and we may not satisfy those tests a breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under the senior secured credit facility if the banks accelerate amounts owing under the senior secured credit facility because of a default under the senior secured credit facility and we are unable to pay such amounts the banks have the right to foreclose on substantially all of our assets 

upon the occurrence of specific kinds of change of control events domino’s inc must offer to repurchase all of its outstanding senior subordinated notes it is possible however that we will not have sufficient funds at the time of the change of control to make the required repurchase of the senior subordinated notes or that restrictions in the senior secured credit facility will not allow such repurchase the occurrence of some of the events that would constitute a change of control under the indenture would also constitute a default under the senior secured credit facility moreover the exercise by the holders of the senior subordinated notes of their right to require domino’s inc to repurchase the senior subordinated notes could cause a default under such senior indebtedness even if the change of control itself does not due to the financial effect on us of such repurchase a default under the indenture or the senior secured credit facility may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we do not have longterm contracts with many of our suppliers and as a result they could seek to significantly increase prices or fail to deliver 

we typically do not have written contracts or longterm arrangements with our suppliers although in the past we have not experienced significant problems with our suppliers our suppliers may implement significant price increases or may not meet our requirements in a timely fashion if at all the occurrence of any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

shortages or interruptions in the supply or delivery of fresh food products could adversely affect our operating results 

we and our franchisees are dependent on frequent deliveries of fresh food products that meet our specifications shortages or interruptions in the supply of fresh food products caused by unanticipated demand problems in production or distribution inclement weather or other conditions could adversely affect the availability quality and cost of ingredients which would adversely affect our operating results 

any prolonged disruption in the operations of any of our dough manufacturing and distribution centers could harm our business 

we operate 17 regional dough manufacturing and distribution centers and one vegetable processing distribution center in the contiguous united states and dough manufacturing and distribution centers in alaska hawaii canada the netherlands and france our domestic dough manufacturing and distribution centers service all of our companyowned stores and approximately 98 of our domestic franchise stores as a result any prolonged disruption in the operations of any of these facilities whether due to technical or labor difficulties destruction or damage to the facility real estate issues or other reasons could adversely affect our business and operating results 

  

we face risks of litigation from customers franchisees employees and others in the ordinary course of business which diverts our financial and management resources any adverse litigation or publicity may negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations 

claims of illness or injury relating to food quality or food handling are common in the food service industry in addition class action lawsuits have been filed and may continue to be filed against various quick service restaurants alleging among other things that quick service restaurants have failed to disclose the health risks associated with highfat foods and that quick service restaurant marketing practices have encouraged obesity in addition to decreasing our sales and profitability and diverting our management resources adverse publicity or a substantial judgment against us could negatively impact our financial condition results of operations and brand reputation hindering our ability to attract and retain franchisees and grow our business 

further we may be subject to employee franchisee and other claims in the future based on among other things discrimination harassment wrongful termination and wage rest break and meal break issues including those relating to overtime compensation we have been subject to these types of claims in the past and we are currently subject to a purported class action claim of this type in california relating to rest break and meal break compensation and if one or more of these claims were to be successful or if there is a significant increase in the number of these claims our business financial condition and operating results could be harmed 

loss of key personnel or our inability to attract and retain new qualified personnel could hurt our business and inhibit our ability to operate and grow successfully 

our success in the highly competitive business of pizza delivery will continue to depend to a significant extent on our leadership team and other key management personnel other than with our chairman and chief executive officer david a brandon we do not have longterm employment agreements with any of our executive officers as a result we may not be able to retain our executive officers and key personnel or attract additional qualified management our success also will continue to depend on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel to operate our stores dough manufacturing and distribution centers and international operations the loss of these employees or our inability to recruit and retain qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 

our international operations subject us to additional risks such risks and costs may differ in each country in which we do business and may cause our profitability to decline due to increased costs 

we conduct a portion of our business outside the united states our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected if global markets in which our companyowned and franchise stores compete are affected by changes in political economic or other factors these factors over which neither we nor our franchisees have control may include 

• recessionary or expansive trends in international markets 

• changing labor conditions and difficulties in staffing and managing our foreign operations 

• increases in the taxes we pay and other changes in applicable tax laws 

• legal and regulatory changes and the burdens and costs of our compliance with a variety of foreign laws 

• changes in inflation rates 

• changes in exchange rates and the imposition of restrictions on currency conversion or the transfer of funds 

• difficulty in collecting our royalties and longer payment cycles 

• expropriation of private enterprises 

• political and economic instability and

fluctuations in the value of the us dollar in relation to other currencies may lead to lower revenues and earnings 

exchange rate fluctuations could have an adverse effect on our results of operations approximately 72 81 and 86 of total revenues were derived from our international segment in 2003 2004 and 2005 respectively a majority of which were denominated in foreign currencies sales made by our stores outside the united states are denominated in the currency of the country in which the store is located and this currency could become less valuable prior to conversion to us dollars as a result of exchange rate fluctuations unfavorable currency fluctuations could lead to increased prices to customers outside the united states or lower profitability to our franchisees outside the united states or could result in lower revenues for us on a us dollar basis from such customers and franchisees 

  

we may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property which could harm the value of our brand and branded products and adversely affect our business 

we depend in large part on our brand and branded products and believe that they are very important to our business we rely on a combination of trademarks copyrights service marks trade secrets and similar intellectual property rights to protect our brand and branded products the success of our business depends on our continued ability to use our existing trademarks and service marks in order to increase brand awareness and further develop our branded products in both domestic and international markets we have registered certain trademarks and have other trademark registrations pending in the united states and foreign jurisdictions not all of the trademarks that we currently use have been registered in all of the countries in which we do business and they may never be registered in all of these countries we may not be able to adequately protect our trademarks and our use of these trademarks may result in liability for trademark infringement trademark dilution or unfair competition all of the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property in the united states and in foreign countries may not be adequate in addition the laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states further through acquisitions of third parties we may acquire brands and related trademarks that are subject to the same risks as the brands and trademarks we currently own 

we may from time to time be required to institute litigation to enforce our trademarks or other intellectual property rights or to protect our trade secrets such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could negatively affect our sales profitability and prospects regardless of whether we are able to successfully enforce our rights 

our earnings and business growth strategy depends on the success of our franchisees and we may be harmed by actions taken by our franchisees that are outside of our control 

a significant portion of our earnings comes from royalties generated by our franchise stores franchisees are independent operators and their employees are not our employees we provide limited training and support to franchisees but the quality of franchise store operations may be diminished by any number of factors beyond our control consequently franchisees may not successfully operate stores in a manner consistent with our standards and requirements or may not hire and train qualified managers and other store personnel if they do not our image and reputation may suffer and our revenues and stock price could decline while we try to ensure that our franchisees maintain the quality of our brand and branded products our franchisees may take actions that adversely affect the value of our intellectual property or reputation as of january 1 2006 we had 1279 domestic franchisees operating 4511 domestic stores five of these franchisees each operate over 50 domestic stores including our largest domestic franchisee which operates 136 stores and the average franchisee operates three to four stores in addition our international master franchisees are generally responsible for the development of significantly more stores than our domestic franchisees as a result our international operations are more closely tied to the success of a smaller number of franchisees than our domestic operations our largest international master franchisee operates 555 stores which accounts for approximately 19 of our total international store count our domestic and international franchisees may not operate their franchises successfully if one or more of our key franchisees were to become insolvent or otherwise were unable or unwilling to pay us our royalties our business and results of operations would be adversely affected

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

overview 

our fiscal year typically includes 52 weeks comprised of three twelve week quarters and one sixteen week quarter every five or six years our fiscal year includes an extra or 53 rd  week in the fourth quarter of that year fiscal 2004 consisted of 53 weeks while fiscal 2003 and fiscal 2005 consisted of 52 weeks 

we are the number one pizza delivery company in the united states with a 194 share of the pizza delivery market based on reported consumer spending we also have a leading international presence we operate through a network of 588 companyowned stores substantially all of which are in the united states and 7491 franchise stores located in all 50 states and in more than 50 countries in addition we operate 17 regional dough manufacturing and distribution centers in the contiguous united states as well as eight dough manufacturing and distribution centers outside the contiguous united states 

our financial results are driven largely by retail sales at our companyowned and franchise stores changes in retail sales are driven by changes in same store sales and store counts we monitor both of these metrics very closely as they directly impact our revenues and profits and strive to consistently increase the related amounts retail sales drive companyowned store revenues royalty payments from franchisees and distribution revenues retail sales are primarily impacted by the strength of the domino’s pizza ® brand the success of our marketing promotions and our ability to execute our store operating model and other business strategies 

we devote significant attention to our brandbuilding efforts which is evident in our system’s estimated 13 billion of domestic advertising spending over the past five years and our frequent designation as a megabrand by advertising age  we plan on continuing to build our brand and retail sales by satisfying customers worldwide with our pizza delivery offerings and by continuing to invest significant amounts in the advertising and marketing of the domino’s pizza ® brand 

we also pay particular attention to the store economics or the investment performance of a store to its owner of both our companyowned and franchise stores we believe that our system’s favorable store economics benefit from the relatively small initial and ongoing investments required to own and operate a domino’s pizza store we believe these favorable investment requirements coupled with a strong brand message supported by significant advertising spending as well as highquality and focused menu offerings drive strong store economics which in turn drive demand for new stores 

in 2005 global retail sales which are total retail sales at companyowned and franchise stores worldwide increased 78 as compared to 2004 despite having a 53 rd week in 2004 which negatively impacted our 2005 global retail sales growth by approximately two percentage points in 2004 global retail sales increased 105 as compared to 2003 these global retail sales increases have been driven by both strong global same store sales growth and unit growth 

our revenues have increased over the past three years as a result of higher store counts increases in same store sales and increases in distribution sales worldwide store counts have increased from 7230 at the beginning of 2003 to 8079 at the end of 2005 this growth in store counts can be attributed to the growing global acceptance of our brand and our pizza delivery concept as well as the economics inherent in our system which attracts new franchisees and encourages existing franchisees to grow their business domestic same store sales increased 13 18 and 49 in 2003 2004 and 2005 respectively international same store sales increased 40 59 and 61 during the same periods we believe that our mix of new product introductions such as domino’s steak fanatic pizza and domino’s philly cheese steak pizza and strong valueoriented promotional activities such as domino’s 555 deal continue to produce strong same store sales results internationally same stores sales growth continues to result from the overall acceptance of delivered pizza around the globe and the successful execution of the concept 

income from operations has increased from 1595 million in 2003 to 1991 million in 2005 this growth in income from operations was primarily the result of increases in store counts and same store sales and related profits from distribution center operations additionally the 2003 income from operations amount included 157 million of general and administrative expenses incurred in connection with our recapitalization in 2003 net income increased from 390 million in 2003 to 1083 million in 2005 the 2003 net income amount included 517 million of pretax expenses incurred in connection with our recapitalization in 2003 

  

we are highly leveraged as the result of recapitalizations in 1998 and 2003 as of january 1 2006 consolidated longterm debt was 7377 million since 1998 a large portion of our cash flows provided from operations has been used to make principal and interest payments on our indebtedness our senior subordinated notes require no principal payments until maturity in 2011 our senior credit facility requires principal payments of 32 million 43 million 54 million and 4100 million in 2007 2008 2009 and 2010 respectively we have decreased our total leverage ratio or total debt divided by total segment income from 39x at the time of our 2004 ipo to 36x at the end of 2004 to 31x at the end of 2005 as a result of both debt reductions and continued improved operating performance overall we believe that our ability to consistently produce significant free cash flows allows us the flexibility not only to service our significant debt but also invest in our business pay dividends to our shareholders and opportunistically repurchase outstanding common stock 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america the preparation of these financial statements requires our management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis our management evaluates its estimates including those related to revenue recognition allowance for uncollectible receivables longlived and intangible assets insurance and legal matters and income taxes we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from those estimates changes in our accounting policies and estimates could materially impact our results of operations and financial condition for any particular period we believe that our most critical accounting policies and estimates are 

revenue recognition  we earn revenues through our network of domestic companyowned and franchise stores dough manufacturing and distribution centers and international operations retail sales from companyowned stores and royalty revenues resulting from the retail sales from franchise stores are recognized as revenues when the items are delivered to or carried out by customers sales of food from our distribution centers are recognized as revenues upon delivery of the food to franchisees while sales of equipment and supplies from our distribution centers are generally recognized as revenues upon shipment of the related products to franchisees 

allowance for uncollectible receivables we closely monitor our accounts and notes receivable balances and provide allowances for uncollectible amounts as a result of our reviews these estimates are based on among other factors historical collection experience and a review of our receivables by aging category additionally we may also provide allowances for uncollectible receivables based on specific customer collection issues that we have identified while writeoffs of bad debts have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established management cannot guarantee that future writeoffs will not exceed historical rates specifically if the financial condition of our franchisees were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments additional allowances may be required 

longlived and intangible assets we record longlived assets including property plant and equipment and capitalized software at cost for acquisitions of franchise operations we estimate the fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired based on physical inspection of assets historical experience and other information available to us regarding the acquisition we depreciate and amortize longlived assets using useful lives determined by us based on historical experience and other information available to us we review longlived assets for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that the related amounts might be impaired we perform related impairment tests on a market level basis for companyowned stores at january 1 2006 we determined that our longlived assets were not impaired however if our future operating performance were to deteriorate we may be required to recognize an impairment charge 

we evaluate goodwill for impairment by comparing the fair value of our reporting units to their carrying values a significant portion of our goodwill relates to acquisitions of domestic franchise stores and is included in our domestic stores segment at january 1 2006 the fair value of our business operations with associated goodwill exceeded their recorded carrying value including the related goodwill however if the future performance of our domestic companyowned stores or other reporting units were to deteriorate we may be required to recognize a goodwill impairment charge 

insurance and legal matters we are a party to lawsuits and legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business management closely monitors these legal matters and estimates the probable costs for the resolution of such matters these estimates are primarily determined by consulting with both internal and external parties handling the matters and are based upon an analysis of potential results assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies if our estimates relating to legal matters proved inaccurate for any reason we may be required to increase or decrease the related expense in future periods 

  

for certain periods prior to december 1998 and for periods after december 2001 we maintain insurance coverage for workers’ compensation general liability and owned and nonowned auto liability under insurance policies requiring payment of a deductible for each occurrence up to between 500000 and 30 million depending on the policy year and line of coverage the related insurance reserves are based on undiscounted independent actuarial estimates which are based on historical information along with assumptions about future events changes in assumptions for such factors as medical costs and legal actions as well as changes in actual experience could cause these estimates to change in the near term which could result in an increase or decrease in the related expense in future periods 

income taxes our net deferred tax assets assume that we will generate sufficient taxable income in specific tax jurisdictions based on estimates and assumptions the amounts relating to taxes recorded on the balance sheet including tax reserves also consider the ultimate resolution of revenue agent reviews based on estimates and assumptions if these estimates and assumptions change in the future we may be required to adjust our valuation allowance or other tax reserves resulting in additional income tax expense or benefit in future periods

the 316 million increase in consolidated operating margin was due primarily to increases in royalties resulting from higher retail sales at both our domestic and international franchise stores and increases in the operating margins from both our domestic companyowned store and domestic distribution operations offset in part by the negative impact of the inclusion of the 53 rd week in 2004 franchise revenues do not have a cost of sales component and as a result increases in franchise revenues have a disproportionate effect on the consolidated operating margin 

as a percentage of total revenues our consolidated operating margin increased primarily as a result of the aforementioned increase in our domestic franchise operating margin and a market decrease in overall food prices primarily cheese which benefited both domestic companyowned store and domestic distribution operating margins as a percentage of revenues changes in the operating margin at our domestic companyowned store operations and our domestic distribution operations are more fully described below

as a percentage of distribution revenues our distribution operating margin increased primarily as a result of lower food prices including cheese the aforementioned increase in volumes and operational and purchasing efficiencies decreases in certain food prices including cheese have a positive effect on the distribution operating margin due to the fixed dollar margin earned by domestic distribution on certain food items including cheese had the 2005 cheese prices been in effect during 2004 the domestic distribution operating margin as a percentage of domestic distribution revenues would have been approximately 94 for 2004 resulting in a domestic distribution operating margin increase of 03 percentage points in 2005

domestic franchise revenues from domestic franchise operations increased 105 million or 73 to 1550 million in 2004 from 1445 million in 2003 this increase was due primarily to an increase in same store sales and an increase in the average number of domestic franchise stores open during 2004 additionally domestic franchise revenues were positively impacted by approximately 30 million due to the inclusion of the 53 rd week in 2004 same store sales for domestic franchise stores increased 21 in 2004 compared to 2003 there were 4327 and 4428 domestic franchise stores in operation as of december 28 2003 and january 2 2005 respectively 

  

domestic distribution revenues from domestic distribution operations increased 749 million or 105 to 7920 million in 2004 from 7171 million in 2003 this increase was due primarily to an increase in volumes relating to increases in domestic franchise retail sales and a market increase in overall food prices primarily cheese cheese prices favorably impacted revenues by approximately 444 million in 2004 additionally domestic distribution revenues were positively impacted by approximately 167 million due to the inclusion of the 53 rd week in 2004 

international revenues from international operations increased 206 million or 214 to 1170 million in 2004 from 964 million in 2003 this increase was due primarily to an increase in same store sales an increase in the average number of international stores open during 2004 and a related increase in revenues from our international distribution operations additionally international revenues were positively impacted by approximately 25 million due to the inclusion of the 53 rd week in 2004 on a constant dollar basis same store sales increased 59 in 2004 compared to 2003 on a historical dollar basis same store sales increased 115 in 2004 compared to 2003 reflecting a generally weaker us dollar in those markets in which we compete there were 2523 and 2749 international stores in operation as of december 28 2003 and january 2 2005 respectively 

cost of sales  operating margin the consolidated operating margin which we define as revenues less cost of sales increased 181 million or 54 to 3537 million in 2004 from 3356 million in 2003 as summarized in the following table 

 

 the 181 million increase in consolidated operating margin was due primarily to increases in royalties resulting from higher retail sales at both our domestic and international franchise stores offset in part by decreases in the operating margin from both our domestic companyowned store and domestic distribution operations franchise revenues do not have a cost of sales component and as a result increases in franchise revenues have a disproportionate effect on the consolidated operating margin 

as a percentage of total revenues our consolidated operating margin decreased primarily as a result of increased costs at our domestic companyowned stores offset in part by the aforementioned increases in domestic franchise and international operating margins changes in the operating margin at our domestic companyowned store operations and our domestic distribution operations are more fully described below 

domestic companyowned stores the domestic companyowned store operating margin decreased 45 million or 62 to 689 million in 2004 from 734 million in 2003 as summarized in the following table 

 

 the 45 million decrease in the domestic companyowned store operating margin is primarily due to a 24 million adjustment related to a correction in accounting for leases as well as increases in food and occupancy costs additionally the domestic companyowned store operating margin was positively impacted by approximately 24 million due to the inclusion of the 53 rd week in 2004 

as a percentage of store revenues food costs increased 12 percentage points to 285 in 2004 from 273 in 2003 due primarily to a market increase in food prices principally cheese the cheese block price per pound averaged 164 in 2004 compared to 131 in 2003 as a percentage of store revenues occupancy costs which include rent telephone utilities and other related costs including depreciation and amortization increased 07 percentage points to 119 in 2004 from 112 in 2003 the 07 percentage point increase in occupancy costs was due to an increase in rent expense as a result of the company’s correction in accounting for leases as a percentage of store revenues labor costs decreased 02 percentage points to 299 in 2004 from 301 in 2003 additionally the domestic companyowned store operating margin as a percentage of store revenues was positively impacted by approximately 03 percentage points due to the inclusion of the 53 rd week in 2004 

domestic distribution the domestic distribution operating margin decreased 03 million or 05 to 731 million in 2004 from 734 million in 2003 as summarized in the following table 

 

   

the 03 million decrease in the domestic distribution operating margin was due primarily to increases in labor delivery costs and insurance as well as a 08 million adjustment related to a correction in accounting for leases these decreases were offset in part by increases in volumes and efficiencies in the areas of operations and purchasing additionally the domestic distribution operating margin was positively impacted by approximately 14 million due to the inclusion of the 53 rd week in 2004 

as a percentage of distribution revenues our distribution operating margin decreased primarily as a result of rising food prices including cheese offset in part by the aforementioned increase in volumes and operational and purchasing efficiencies increases in certain food prices including cheese have a negative effect on the distribution operating margin due to the fixed dollar margin earned by domestic distribution on certain food items including cheese had the 2004 cheese prices been in effect during 2003 the domestic distribution operating margin as a percentage of domestic distribution revenues would have been approximately 96 for 2003 resulting in a domestic distribution operating margin decrease of 04 percentage points in 2004 additionally the domestic distribution operating margin as a percentage of distribution revenues was not significantly impacted by the inclusion of the 53 rd week in 2004 

general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses increased 62 million or 35 to 1823 million in 2004 from 1761 million in 2003 as a percentage of total revenues general and administrative expenses decreased 06 percentage points to 126 in 2004 from 132 in 2003 general and administrative expenses were negatively impacted by a 100 million management agreement termination fee paid to an affiliate in connection with the company’s ipo as well as a 38 million yearoveryear decrease in gains on the saledisposal of assets in addition the company recognized a credit of 17 million in 2003 relating to the collection of a previously fully reserved note receivable general and administrative expenses were also negatively impacted by higher office rents and approximately 26 million of additional general and administrative expenses primarily labor and advertising due to the inclusion of the 53 rd week in 2004 offsetting these increases in general and administrative expenses was approximately 157 million of expenses incurred in connection with the company’s june 2003 recapitalization 

interest expense interest expense decreased 136 million or 182 to 611 million in 2004 from 747 million in 2003 this decrease was due primarily to lower effective borrowing rates which more than offset an increase in average outstanding borrowings the average outstanding debt balance excluding capital lease obligations increased 949 million to 8804 million in 2004 from 7855 million in 2003 our effective borrowing rate decreased 09 percentage points to 58 in 2004 from 67 in 2003 additionally interest expense was positively impacted by approximately 156 million of financing costs that were writtenoff in connection with the company’s recapitalization in 2003 offset in part by the writeoff of approximately 37 million of financing costs and bond discount in connection with the retirement of 1091 million of senior subordinated notes made in connection with the company’s initial public offering total deferred financing fee and bond discount expense including the aforementioned amounts was 208 million and 78 million in 2003 and 2004 respectively

liquidity and capital resources 

as of january 1 2006 we had working capital of 40 million and cash and cash equivalents of 669 million historically we have operated with minimal positive working capital or negative working capital primarily because our receivable collection periods and inventory turn rates are faster than the normal payment terms on our current liabilities we generally collect our receivables within three weeks from the date of the related sale and we generally experience 40 to 50 inventory turns per year in addition our sales are not typically seasonal which further limits our working capital requirements these factors coupled with significant and ongoing cash flows from operations which are primarily used to repay longterm debt pay dividends and invest in longterm assets reduce our working capital amounts our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations and availability of borrowings under our revolving credit facility we have historically funded capital expenditures and debt repayments from cash flows from operations and expect to in the future we did not have any material commitments for capital expenditures as of january 1 2006 

as of january 1 2006 we had 7377 million of longterm debt of which 353 million was classified as a current liability during 2005 we borrowed 400 million on our revolving credit facility that along with cash from operations was used to repurchase approximately 44 million shares of our common stock from a former affiliate the entire 400 million was repaid in 2005 at january 1 2006 there were no outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility letters of credit issued under our 1250 million revolving credit facility were 305 million these letters of credit are primarily related to our insurance programs and distribution center leases borrowings under the revolving credit facility are available to fund our working capital requirements capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes 

cash provided by operating activities was 1412 million and 1122 million in 2005 and 2004 respectively the 290 million increase was due primarily to a 460 million increase in net income a 122 million net change in operating assets and liabilities and a 37 million increase in noncash compensation expenses the 122 million net change in operating assets and liabilities was due primarily to the timing of accounts receivable and accounts payable transactions the 37 million increase in noncash compensation expenses was due primarily to the adoption of sfas 123r these increases were offset in part by a 202 million change in gains losses on the saledisposal of assets an 85 million decrease in provision for deferred income taxes and a 48 million decrease in amortization of deferred financing costs and debt discount the 202 million change in gains losses on the saledisposal of assets was due primarily to the sale of an equity investment in an international master franchisee in 2005 the 48 million decrease in amortization of deferred financing costs and debt discount was due primarily to charges incurred in connection with our ipo in 2004 

cash provided by investing activities was 01 million in 2005 cash used in investing activities was 363 million in 2004 the 364 million net change was due primarily to a 239 million increase in proceeds from the sale of equity investments and an 111 million decrease in capital expenditures the increase in proceeds from the sale of equity investments was due to the sale of an equity investment in a master franchisee in 2005 the decrease in capital expenditures was due primarily to the timing of the renovation of our corporate headquarters which was completed in early 2005 

cash used in financing activities was 1146 million and 826 million in 2005 and 2004 respectively the 320 million increase was due primarily a 1187 million decrease in net proceeds from the issuance of common stock a 732 million increase in purchases of common stock and a 224 million increase in dividend payments offset in part by a 1004 million decrease in repayments of longterm debt 400 million of proceeds resulting from shortterm borrowings a 169 million decrease in distributions to our founder and former majority stockholder and his wife in conjunction with our initial public offering in 2004 and a 202 million increase in tax benefit from the exercise of stock options 

on june 25 2003 we consummated a recapitalization transaction whereby domino’s inc i issued and sold 4030 million aggregate principal amount at maturity of 8 1  4  senior subordinated notes due 2011 at a discount resulting in gross proceeds of approximately 4001 million and ii borrowed 6100 million in term loans and secured a 1250 million revolving credit facility from a consortium of banks collectively the “senior secured credit facility” the senior secured credit facility was subsequently amended primarily to obtain more favorable interest rate margins to amend the principal amortization schedule to allow for the repayment of a portion of the senior subordinated notes as part of our ipo in lieu of a required payment under the senior secured credit facility to allow the payment of dividends to our stockholders and to allow for the purchase and retirement of common stock 

  

the senior subordinated notes require semiannual interest payments beginning january 1 2004 before july 1 2007 we may at a price above par redeem all but not part of the senior subordinated notes if a change in control occurs as defined in the indenture governing the notes beginning july 1 2007 we may redeem some or all of the senior subordinated notes at fixed redemption prices ranging from 104125 of par in 2007 to 100 of par in 2009 through maturity in the event of a change in control as defined we will be obligated to repurchase the senior subordinated notes tendered at the option of the holders at a fixed price upon a public stock offering we may use the net proceeds from such offering to repurchase and retire up to 40 of the aggregate principal amount of the senior subordinated notes due 2011 provided that at least 60 of the original principal amount of the senior subordinated notes due 2011 remains outstanding immediately following the repurchase during 2004 we used the net proceeds from our ipo to redeem approximately 1091 million in principal amount of our senior subordinated notes the senior subordinated notes are guaranteed by most of domino’s inc’s domestic subsidiaries and one foreign subsidiary and are subordinated in right of payment to all existing and future senior debt of the company 

the senior secured credit facility provides the following credit facilities a term loan and a revolving credit facility the aggregate borrowings available under the senior secured credit facility are 7350 million the senior secured credit facility provides borrowings of 6100 million in term loans the term loan was initially fully borrowed term loans outstanding as of january 1 2006 were 4580 million borrowings under the term loan bear interest payable at least quarterly at either i the higher of a the prime rate 725 at january 1 2006 and b 050 above the federal reserve reported overnight funds rate each plus an applicable margin of 050 or ii libor 456 at january 1 2006 plus an applicable margin of 150 at january 1 2006 our borrowing rate was 606 for term loan borrowings as of january 1 2006 all borrowings under the term loan were under a libor contract with an interest period of 90 days 

early in 2006 we made a voluntary term loan payment of 350 million after this payment the senior secured credit facility requires no term loan principal payments in 2006 and term loan payments of 32 million 43 million 54 million and 4100 million in 2007 2008 2009 and 2010 respectively the timing of our required payments under the senior secured credit facility may change based upon voluntary prepayments and generation of excess cash flow we are required to pay between 25 and 75 of the excess cash flow generated the required percentage is determined once a year and is based on our leverage ratio at the end of the preceding year excess cash flow is calculated as i earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization less ii the sum of debt repayments capital expenditures cash interest expense provision for current taxes and certain other adjustments if any which have historically included our 2003 recapitalization transaction expenses comprised of bond tender fees and financing fees and our 2004 ipo expenses comprised primarily of the payment made to an affiliate of our former majority stockholder in connection with the termination of its management agreement with us total debt is divided by the amount in clause i to calculate the leverage ratio if the leverage ratio is over 40 between 40 and 325 or less than 325 we are obligated to pay 75 50 or 25 of the excess cash flows amounts generated respectively the required percentage for 2005 to be paid in 2006 was 25 however no payment is required in 2006 because there is no excess cash flow as calculated as we voluntarily prepaid a significant amount of term loans during the year upon a public stock offering we are required to pay down the term loan in an amount equal to 50 of the net proceeds of such offering 

in connection with our ipo we amended our senior secured credit facility and obtained consent under the facility to permit the use of proceeds described in our offering prospectus filed with the securities and exchange commission the final scheduled principal payment on the outstanding borrowings under the term loan is due in june 2010 

the senior secured credit facility also provides for borrowings of up to 1250 million under the revolving credit facility of which up to 600 million is available for letter of credit advances borrowings under the revolving credit facility excluding letters of credit bear interest payable at least quarterly at either i the higher of a the prime rate and b 050 above the federal reserve reported overnight funds rate each plus an applicable margin of between 125 to 200 or ii libor plus an applicable margin of between 225 to 300 with margins determined based upon our ratio of indebtedness to ebitda as defined we also pay a 050 commitment fee on the unused portion of the revolver the fee for letter of credit amounts outstanding ranges from 2375 to 3125 at january 1 2006 the fee for letter of credit amounts outstanding was 2625 at january 1 2006 there was 945 million in available borrowings under the revolving credit facility with 305 million of letters of credit outstanding the revolving credit facility expires in june 2009 

  

based upon our current level of operations and anticipated growth we believe that the cash generated from our operations and amounts available under our revolving credit facility will be adequate to meet our anticipated debt service requirements including payments required under the excess cash flow provisions of our senior secured credit facility capital expenditures and working capital needs for the next several years we believe that we will be able to meet these obligations even if we experience no growth in sales or profits our ability to continue to fund these items and continue to reduce debt could be adversely affected by the occurrence of any of the events described in item 1a risk factors there can be no assurance however that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operations or that future borrowings will be available under our revolving credit facility or otherwise to enable us to service our indebtedness including our senior secured credit facility and senior subordinated notes or to make anticipated capital expenditures our future operating performance and our ability to service or refinance the senior subordinated notes and to service extend or refinance the senior secured credit facility will be subject to future economic conditions and to financial business and other factors many of which are beyond our control

we are also exposed to market risks from changes in commodity prices during the normal course of business we purchase cheese and certain other food products that are affected by changes in commodity prices and as a result we are subject to volatility in our food costs we do not enter into financial instruments to hedge commodity prices we purchase cheese at market prices which fluctuate on a daily basis the cheese block price per pound averaged 164 and 150 in 2004 and 2005 respectively the estimated change in companyowned store food costs from a hypothetical 025 change in the average cheese block price per pound would have been approximately 40 million in 2005 this hypothetical change in food cost could be positively or negatively impacted by average ticket changes and product mix changes 

financial derivatives 

we enter into interest rate swaps collars or similar instruments with the objective of reducing volatility relating to our borrowing costs in addition to fulfilling requirements under our debt agreements

 interest rate risk 

our variable interest expense is sensitive to changes in the general level of interest rates as of january 1 2006 the weighted average interest rate on our 2080 million of variable interest debt which is net of related outstanding derivative instruments was 69 

we had total interest expense of approximately 488 million in 2005 the estimated increase in interest expense for this period from a hypothetical 200 basis point adverse change in applicable variable interest rates would be approximately 42 million

overview 

  

domino’s pizza inc referred to as the “company” “domino’s” or in the first person notations of “we” “us” and “our” is the number one pizza delivery company in the united states based on reported consumer spending and has a leading presence internationally we pioneered the pizza delivery business and have built the domino’s pizza ® brand into one of the most widelyrecognized consumer brands in the world together with our franchisees we have supported the domino’s pizza ® brand with an estimated 13 billion in domestic advertising spending over the past five years we operate through a network of more than 7750 companyowned and franchise stores located in all 50 states and in more than 50 countries in addition we operate 18 regional dough manufacturing and distribution centers in the contiguous united states and eight dough manufacturing and distribution centers outside the contiguous united states the foundation of our systemwide success and leading market position is our strong relationship with our franchisees comprised of approximately 2000 owneroperators dedicated to the success of our company and the domino’s pizza ® brand 

  

over our 44year history we have developed a simple business model focused on our core strength of delivering quality pizza in a timely manner this business model includes a deliveryoriented store design with low capital requirements a focused menu of pizza and complementary side items committed owneroperator franchisees and a verticallyintegrated distribution system our earnings are driven largely from retail sales at our franchise stores which generate royalty payments and distribution revenues to us we also generate earnings through retail sales at our companyowned stores 

  

we operate our business in three segments domestic stores domestic distribution and international 

  

• domestic stores the domestic stores segment which is comprised of 4428 franchise stores and 580 companyowned stores generated revenues of 5375 million and income from operations of 1315 million during 2004 

  

• domestic distribution our domestic distribution segment which manufactures dough and distributes food equipment and supplies to all of our domestic companyowned stores and over 98 of our domestic franchise stores generated revenues of 7920 million and income from operations of 461 million during 2004 

  

• international our international segment oversees 2728 franchise stores and operates 21 companyowned stores outside the contiguous united states it also manufactures dough and distributes food and supplies in a limited number of these markets our international segment generated revenues of 1170 million and income from operations of 341 million during 2004 

  

on a consolidated basis we generated revenues of over 14 billion and income from operations after deducting 403 million of unallocated corporate and other expenses of 1714 million in 2004 net income was 623 million in 2004 we have been able to increase our income from operations through strong domestic and international same store sales growth over the past five years the addition of nearly 1200 stores worldwide over that time and strong performance by our distribution business over this same time period we increased our net income in each year except 2003 during which we incurred significant recapitalizationrelated expenses this growth was achieved with limited capital expenditures by us since a significant portion of our earnings are derived from retail sales by our franchisees 

  

our history 

  

we have been delivering quality affordable pizza to our customers since 1960 when brothers thomas and james monaghan borrowed 900 and purchased a small pizza store in ypsilanti michigan since that time our store count and geographic reach have grown substantially we opened our first franchise store in 1967 our first international store in 1983 and by 1998 we had expanded to over 6200 stores including more than 1700 international stores on six continents 

  

in 1998 an investor group led by investment funds affiliated with bain capital llc completed a recapitalization through which the investor group acquired a 93 controlling economic interest in our company from thomas monaghan and his family at the time of the recapitalization mr monaghan retired and in march 1999 david a brandon was named our chairman and chief executive officer in 2004 domino’s pizza inc completed its initial public offering the “ipo” and now trades on the new york stock exchange under the ticker symbol “dpz” 

  

industry overview 

  

in this document we rely on and refer to information regarding the us quick service restaurant or qsr sector the us qsr pizza category and its components and competitors including us from the crest report prepared by npd foodworld ®  a division of the npd group or crest as well as market research reports analyst reports and other publiclyavailable information although we believe this information to be reliable we have not independently verified it domestic sales information relating to the qsr sector us qsr pizza category and us pizza delivery and carryout represent reported consumer spending obtained by crest from customer surveys this information relates to both our companyowned and franchise stores unless otherwise indicated all us industry data included in this document is based on reported consumer spending obtained by crest from customer surveys 

  

the us qsr pizza category is large growing and highly fragmented with sales of 330 billion in the twelve months ended november 2004 the us qsr pizza category is the second largest category within the 1870 billion us qsr sector the us qsr pizza category is comprised of delivery dinein carryout and drivethrough we operate primarily within us pizza delivery its 119 billion of sales accounted for 36 of total us qsr pizza category sales in the twelve months ended november 2004 

  

total us pizza delivery sales grew by 16 during that period we believe that this growth is the result of wellestablished demographic and lifestyle trends driving increased consumer emphasis on convenience we and our top two competitors account for approximately 47 of us pizza delivery based on reported consumer spending with the remaining 53 attributable to regional chains and individual establishments 

  

we also compete in carryout which together with pizza delivery are the largest components of the us qsr pizza category us carryout pizza had 122 billion of sales in the twelve months ended november 2004 and while our primary focus is on pizza delivery we are also favorably positioned to compete in carryout given our strong brand convenient store locations and quality affordable menu offerings 

  

in contrast to the united states international pizza delivery is relatively underdeveloped with only domino’s and one other competitor having a significant multinational presence we believe that demand for international pizza delivery is large and growing driven by international consumers’ increasing emphasis on convenience 

  

our competitive strengths 

  

we believe that our competitive strengths include the following 

  

• strong and proven growth and earnings model over our 44year history we have developed a focused growth and earnings model this model is anchored by strong storelevel economics which provide an entrepreneurial incentive for our franchisees and generate demand for new stores our franchise system in turn has produced strong and consistent earnings for us through royalty payments and distribution revenues with minimal associated capital expenditures by us 

  

• strong storelevel economics  we have developed a costefficient store model characterized by a delivery and carryout oriented store design with low capital requirements and a focused menu of quality affordable pizza and complementary side items at the store level we believe that the simplicity and efficiency of our operations give us significant advantages over our competitors who in many cases also focus on dinein 

  

our domestic stores and most of our international stores do not offer dinein areas and thus do not require expensive restaurant facilities and staffing in addition our focused menu of pizza and complementary side items simplifies and streamlines our production and delivery processes and maximizes economies of scale on purchases of our principal ingredients as a result of our focused business model and menu our stores are small averaging approximately 1000 to 1300 square feet and inexpensive to build furnish and maintain as compared to many other qsr franchise opportunities the combination of this efficient store model and strong store sales volume has resulted in strong storelevel financial returns and makes domino’s an attractive business opportunity for existing and prospective franchisees 

  

• strong and welldiversified franchise system  we have developed a large global diversified and committed franchise network that is a critical component of our systemwide success and our leading position in pizza delivery as of january 2 2005 our franchise store network consisted of 7156 stores 62 of which were located in the contiguous united states in the united states only four franchisees operate more than 50 stores including our largest domestic franchisee who operates 153 stores the average franchisee operates approximately three stores we require our domestic franchisees to forego active outside business endeavors aligning their interests with ours and making the success of each domino’s franchise of critical importance to our franchisees 

  

in addition we share 50 of the pretax profits generated by our regional dough manufacturing and distribution centers with those domestic franchisees who agree to purchase all of their food from our distribution system these arrangements strengthen our ties with our franchisees by enhancing their profitability while providing us with a continuing source of revenues and earnings this arrangement also provides incentives for franchisees to work closely with us to reduce costs we believe our strong mutuallybeneficial franchisee relationships are evidenced by the over 98 voluntary participation in our domestic distribution system our over 99 domestic franchise contract renewal rate and our over 99 collection rate on domestic franchise royalty and domestic distribution receivables 

  

internationally we have also been able to grow our franchise network by attracting franchisees with business experience and local market knowledge we generally use our master franchise model which provides our international franchisees with exclusive rights to operate stores or subfranchise our wellrecognized brand name in their specific agreedupon market areas from yearend 2000 through 2004 we grew our international franchise network 26 from 2157 stores to 2728 stores our largest master franchisee operates 526 stores which accounts for approximately 19 of our total international store count 

  

• strong cash flow and earnings stream  a substantial percentage of our earnings are generated by our committed owneroperator franchisees through royalty payments and revenues to our verticallyintegrated distribution system royalty payments yield strong profitability to us because there are minimal corresponding companylevel expenses and capital requirements associated with their collection 

  

we believe that our store economics have led to a strong welldiversified franchise system this established franchise system has produced strong cash flow and earnings for us enabling us to invest in the domino’s pizza ® brand and our stores delever our balance sheet and deliver attractive returns to our stockholders 

  

• 1 pizza delivery company in the united states with a leading international presence we are the number one pizza delivery company in the united states with a 195 share based on reported consumer spending with 5008 stores located in the contiguous united states our domestic store delivery areas cover a majority of us households our share position and scale allow us to leverage our purchasing power distribution strength and advertising investment across our store base we also believe that our scale and market coverage allow us to effectively serve our customers’ demands for convenience and timely delivery 

  

outside the united states we have significant share positions in the key markets in which we compete including among other countries mexico where we are the largest qsr company in terms of store count in any qsr category the united kingdom australia canada south korea japan and taiwan our top ten international markets based on store count accounted for approximately 85 of our international retail sales in 2004 we believe we have a leading presence in these markets 

  

• strong brand awareness we believe our domino’s pizza ® brand is one of the most widelyrecognized consumer brands in the world we believe consumers associate our brand with the timely delivery of quality affordable pizza and complementary side items over the past five years our domestic franchise and companyowned stores have invested an estimated 13 billion on national local and cooperative advertising in the united states our domino’s pizza ® brand has been routinely named a megabrand by advertising age  we continue to reinforce our brand with extensive advertising through television radio and print we also enhance the strength of our brand through marketing affiliations with brands such as cocacola ® and nascar ®  

  

according to industry research reports approximately 91 of pizza consumers in the us are aware of the domino’s pizza ® brand we believe that our brand is particularly strong among pizza consumers for whom dinner is a fairly spontaneous event which industry research indicates to be the case in nearly 50 of pizza dining occasions in these situations we believe that service and product quality are the consumers’ priorities we believe that wellestablished demographic and lifestyle trends will drive continuing emphasis on convenience and will therefore continue to play into our brand’s strength 

  

• our internal dough manufacturing and distribution system in addition to generating significant revenues and earnings we believe that our verticallyintegrated dough manufacturing and distribution system enhances the quality and consistency of our products enhances our relationships with franchisees leverages economies of scale to offer lower costs to our stores and allows our store managers to better focus on store operations and customer service by relieving them of the responsibility of mixing dough in the stores 

  

in 2004 we made over 660000 fullservice food deliveries to our domestic stores or an average of nearly three deliveries per store per week with a delivery accuracy rate of approximately 99 all of our domestic companyowned and over 98 of our domestic franchise stores purchase all of their food and supplies from us this is accomplished through our network of 18 regional dough manufacturing and distribution centers each of which is generally located within a oneday delivery radius of the stores it serves and a leased fleet of over 200 tractors and trailers we supply our domestic and international franchisees with equipment and supplies through our equipment and supply distribution center which we operate as part of our domestic distribution segment our equipment and supply distribution center ships a full range of products including ovens and uniforms on a daily basis 

  

because we source the food for substantially all of our domestic stores our domestic distribution segment enables us to leverage and monitor our strong supplier relationships to achieve the cost benefits of scale and to ensure compliance with our rigorous quality standards in addition the “onestop shop” nature of this system combined with our delivery accuracy allows our store managers to eliminate a significant component of the typical “backofstore” activity that many of our competitors’ store managers must undertake 

  

our business strategy 

  

we intend to achieve further growth and strengthen our competitive position through the continued implementation of our business strategy which includes the following key elements 

  

• continue to execute on our mission statement our mission statement is “exceptional people on a mission to be the best pizza delivery company in the world” we implement this mission statement by focusing on four strategic initiatives 

  

• peoplefirst  attract and retain highquality company employees who we refer to as team members with the goals of reducing turnover and maintaining continuity in the workforce we continually strive to achieve this objective through a combination of performancebased compensation for our nonhourly team members learning and development programs and team member ownership opportunities to promote our entrepreneurial spirit 

  

• build the brand  strengthen and build upon our strong brand name to further solidify our position as the brand of first choice in pizza delivery we continually strive to achieve this objective through product and process innovation advertising and promotional campaigns and a strong brand message 

  

• maintain high standards  elevate and maintain quality throughout the entire domino’s system with the goals of making quality and consistency a competitive advantage controlling costs and supporting our stores we believe that our comprehensive store audits and verticallyintegrated distribution system help us to consistently achieve high quality of operations across our system in a costefficient manner 

  

• flawless execution  perfect operations with the goals of making quality products attaining consistency in execution maintaining the best operating model making our team members a competitive advantage operating stores with smart hustle and aligning us with our franchisees 

  

• grow our leading position in an attractive industry us pizza delivery and carryout are the largest components of the us qsr pizza category they are also highly fragmented pizza delivery through which approximately 75 of our retail sales are generated had sales of 119 billion in the twelve months ended november 2004 and grew by 16 during that period as the leader in us pizza delivery we believe that our convenient store locations simple operating model widelyrecognized brand and efficient distribution system are competitive advantages that position us to capitalize on future growth 

  

carryout through which approximately 25 of our retail sales are generated had 122 billion of sales in the twelve months ended november 2004 while our primary focus is on pizza delivery we are also favorably positioned as a leader in carryout given our strong brand convenient store locations and quality affordable menu offerings 

  

• leverage our strong brand awareness we believe that the strength of our domino’s pizza ® brand makes us one of the first choices of consumers seeking a convenient quality and affordable meal we intend to continue to promote our brand name and enhance our reputation as the leader in pizza delivery for example we intend to continue to promote our successful advertising campaign “get the door it’s domino’s ® ” through national local and cooperative media as part of our strategy to strengthen our brand each of our domestic stores contributed 3 of their retail sales to our advertising fund for national advertising in addition to contributions for marketlevel advertising additionally beginning in 2005 each of such domestic stores increased its contributions to our advertising fund for national advertising from 3 to 4 of retail sales 

  

we intend to leverage our strong brand by continuing to introduce innovative consumertested and profitable new pizza varieties such as domino’s philly cheese steak pizza and domino’s doublemelt pizza ™  and complementary side items such as buffalo wings cheesy bread domino’s buffalo chicken kickers ® and cinna stix ®  as well as through marketing affiliations with brands such as cocacola ® and nascar ®  we believe these opportunities when coupled with our scale and share leadership will allow us to continue to grow our position in us pizza delivery 

  

• expand and optimize our domestic store base we plan to continue expanding our base of domestic stores to take advantage of the attractive growth opportunities in us pizza delivery we believe that our scale allows us to expand our store base with limited marketing distribution and other incremental infrastructure costs additionally our franchiseoriented business model allows us to expand our store base with limited capital expenditures and working capital requirements while we plan to expand our traditional domestic store base primarily through opening new franchise stores we will also continually evaluate our mix of companyowned and franchise stores and strategically acquire franchise stores and refranchise companyowned stores 

  

• continue to grow our international business we believe that pizza has global appeal and that there is strong and growing international demand for delivered pizza we have successfully built a broad international platform almost exclusively through our master franchise model as evidenced by our nearly 2750 international stores in more than 50 countries our international stores have produced positive quarterly same store sales growth for 44 consecutive quarters we believe that we continue to have significant longterm growth opportunities in international markets where we have established a leading presence in our current top ten international markets we believe that our store base is less than half of the total longterm potential store base in those markets generally we believe we will achieve longterm growth internationally as a result of the storelevel economics of our business model the growing international demand for delivered pizza and the strong global recognition of the domino’s pizza ® brand 

  

store operations 

  

we believe that our focused and proven store model provides a significant competitive advantage relative to many of our competitors who focus on multiple components of the pizza category particularly dinein we have been focused on pizza delivery for 44 years because our domestic stores and most of our international stores do not offer dinein areas they typically do not require expensive real estate are relatively small and are relatively inexpensive to build and equip our stores also benefit from lower maintenance costs as store assets have long lives and updates are not frequently required our simple and efficient operational processes which we have refined through continuous improvement include 

  

• strategic store locations to facilitate delivery service 

• productionoriented store designs 

• product and process innovations 

• a focused menu 

• efficient order taking production and delivery 

• domino’s pulse ™ pointofsale system and 

• a comprehensive store audit program 

  

strategic store locations to facilitate delivery service 

  

we locate our stores strategically to facilitate timely delivery service to our customers the majority of our domestic stores are located in populated areas in or adjacent to large or midsize cities or on or near college campuses we use geographic information software which incorporates variables such as traffic volumes competitor locations household demographics and visibility to evaluate and identify potential store locations and new markets 

  

productionoriented store designs 

  

our typical store is relatively small occupying approximately 1000 to 1300 square feet and is designed with a focus on efficient and timely production of consistent quality pizza for delivery the store layout has been refined over time to provide an efficient flow from order taking to delivery our stores are primarily production facilities and accordingly do not typically have a dinein area 

  

product and process innovations 

  

our 44 years of experience and innovative culture have resulted in numerous new product and process developments that increase both quality and efficiency these include our efficient verticallyintegrated distribution system a sturdier corrugated pizza box and a mesh tray that helps cook pizza crust more evenly the domino’s heatwave ® hot bag which was introduced in 1998 keeps our pizzas hot during delivery we have also introduced new pizzas such as domino’s philly cheese steak pizza and domino’s doublemelt pizza ™ as well as added a number of complementary side items such as buffalo wings domino’s buffalo chicken kickers ®  bread sticks cheesy bread and cinna stix ®  

  

focused menu 

  

we maintain a focused menu that is designed to present an attractive quality offering to customers while minimizing errors in and expediting the order taking and food preparation processes our basic menu has three choices pizza type pizza size and pizza toppings most of our stores carry two sizes of traditional handtossed ultimate deep dish and crunchy thin crust pizza our typical store also offers buffalo wings domino’s buffalo chicken kickers ®  bread sticks cheesy bread cinna stix ® and cocacola ® soft drink products we also occasionally offer other products on a promotional basis we believe that our focused menu creates a strong identity among consumers improves operating efficiency and maintains food quality and consistency 

  

efficient order taking production and delivery 

  

each store executes an operational process that includes order taking pizza preparation cooking via automated conveyordriven ovens boxing and delivery the entire order taking and pizza production process is designed for completion in approximately 1215 minutes these operational processes are supplemented by an extensive employee training program designed to ensure worldclass quality and customer service it is our priority to ensure that every domino’s store operates in an efficient consistent manner while maintaining our high standards of food quality and team member safety 

  

domino’s pulse ™ pointofsale system 

  

our computerized management information systems are designed to improve operating efficiencies provide corporate management with timely access to financial and marketing data and reduce store and corporate administrative time and expense we have installed domino’s pulse ™  our proprietary pointofsale system in every companyowned store in the united states some enhanced features of domino’s pulse ™ over our previous pointofsale system include 

  

• touch screen ordering which improves accuracy and facilitates more efficient order taking 

• a delivery driver routing system which improves delivery efficiency 

• improved administrative and reporting capabilities which enable store managers to better focus on store operations and customer satisfaction and 

• a customer relationship management tool which enables us to recognize customers and track ordering preferences 

  

we are requiring our domestic franchisees to install domino’s pulse ™ by february 2007 

  

comprehensive store audit program 

  

we utilize a comprehensive store audit program to ensure that our stores are meeting both our stringent standards as well as the expectations of our customers the audit program focuses primarily on the quality of the pizza a store is producing the outthedoor time and the condition of the store as viewed by the customer we believe that this store audit program is an integral part of our strategy to maintain high standards in our stores 

  

segment overview 

  

we operate in three business segments 

  

• domestic stores our domestic stores segment consists of our domestic franchise operations which oversee our domestic network of 4428 franchise stores and our domestic companyowned store operations which operate our domestic network of 580 companyowned stores 

  

• domestic distribution our domestic distribution segment operates 18 regional dough manufacturing and food distribution centers and one distribution center providing equipment and supplies to certain of our domestic and international stores and 

  

• international our international segment oversees our network of 2728 international franchise stores in more than 50 countries operates 19 companyowned stores in the netherlands and 2 companyowned stores in france our international segment also distributes food to a limited number of markets from eight dough manufacturing and distribution centers in alaska hawaii canada four the netherlands and france 

  

domestic stores 

  

during 2004 our domestic stores segment accounted for 5375 million or 37 of our consolidated revenues our domestic franchises are operated by entrepreneurs who own and operate an average of three stores only four of our domestic franchisees operate more than 50 stores including our largest domestic franchisee who operates 153 stores our principal sources of revenues from domestic store operations are companyowned store sales and royalty payments based on retail sales by our franchisees our domestic network of companyowned stores also plays an important strategic role in our predominantly franchised operating structure in addition to generating revenues and earnings we use our domestic companyowned stores as a test site for new products and promotions as well as store operational improvements and as a forum for training new store managers and prospective franchisees we also believe that our domestic companyowned stores add to the economies of scale available for advertising marketing and other costs that are primarily borne by our franchisees 

  

our domestic store operations are divided into three geographic zones and are managed through offices located in georgia california and maryland the offices provide direct supervision over our domestic companyowned stores and also provide limited training store operational audits and marketing services these offices also provide financial analysis and store development services to our franchisees we maintain a close relationship with our franchise stores through regional franchise teams an array of computerbased training materials that help franchise stores comply with our standards and franchise advisory groups that facilitate communications between us and our franchisees 

  

we continually evaluate our mix of domestic companyowned and franchise stores in an effort to optimize our profitability during 2001 we sold 95 of our domestic companyowned stores to franchisees because we believed that these stores would be more profitable to us if run by franchisees in contrast during 2002 we acquired 83 franchise stores in arizona where we believe there are significant longterm earnings growth opportunities and where we believe that we can utilize our operational expertise to improve the operation of these stores resulting in higher profitability 

  

domestic distribution 

  

during 2004 our domestic distribution segment accounted for 7920 million or 55 of our consolidated revenues our domestic distribution segment is comprised of dough manufacturing and distribution centers that manufacture fresh dough on a daily basis and purchase receive store and deliver quality pizzarelated food products complementary side items and equipment to all of our companyowned stores and over 98 of our domestic franchise stores each regional dough manufacturing and distribution center serves an average of 273 stores generally located within a oneday delivery radius we regularly supply more than 4900 stores with various supplies and ingredients of which nine product groups account for nearly 90 of the volume our domestic distribution segment made approximately 660000 fullservice deliveries in 2004 or nearly three deliveries per store per week and we produced over 355 million pounds of dough during 2004 

  

we believe that franchisees choose to obtain food supplies and equipment from us because we provide the most efficient convenient and costeffective alternative while also providing both quality and consistency in addition our domestic distribution segment offers a profitsharing arrangement to stores that purchase all of their food from our domestic dough manufacturing and distribution centers this profitsharing arrangement provides domestic companyowned stores and participating franchisees with 50 of their regional distribution center’s pretax profits profits are shared with the franchisees based upon each franchisee’s purchases from our distribution centers we believe these arrangements strengthen our ties with these franchisees 

  

the information systems used by our domestic dough manufacturing and distribution centers are an integral part of the quality service we provide our stores we use routing strategies and software to optimize our daily delivery schedules which maximizes ontime deliveries through our strategic dough manufacturing and distribution center locations and proven routing systems we achieved ontime delivery rates of approximately 99 during 2004 our distribution center drivers unload food and supplies and stock store shelves typically during nonpeak store hours which minimizes disruptions in store operations

we have grown by more than 800 international stores over the past five years while our stores are designed for delivery and carryout which are less capitalintensive than dinein we empower our managers and franchisees to adapt the standard operating model within certain parameters to satisfy the local eating habits and consumer preferences of various regions outside the united states currently most of our international stores are operated under master franchise agreements and we plan to continue entering into master franchise agreements with qualified franchisees to expand our international operations in selected countries we believe that our international franchise stores appeal to potential franchisees because of our wellrecognized brand name the limited capital expenditures required to open and operate our stores and our system’s store economics the following table shows our store count as of january 2 2005 in our top ten international markets which account for 78 of our international stores 

  

   

our franchise program 

  

as of january 2 2005 our 4428 domestic franchise stores were owned and operated by our 1300 domestic franchisees the success of our franchise formula which enables franchisees to benefit from our brand name with a relatively low initial capital investment has attracted a large number of motivated entrepreneurs as franchisees as of january 2 2005 the average domestic franchisee operated approximately three stores and had been in our franchise system for nearly nine years at the same time only four of our domestic franchisees operated more than 50 stores including our largest domestic franchisee who operates 153 stores 

  

domestic franchisees 

  

we apply rigorous standards to prospective franchisees we generally require prospective domestic franchisees to manage a store for at least one year before being granted a franchise this enables us to observe the operational and financial performance of a potential franchisee prior to entering into a longterm contract we also restrict the ability of domestic franchisees to become involved in other businesses which focuses our franchisees’ attention on operating their stores as a result the vast majority of our franchisees come from within the domino’s pizza system we believe these standards are unique to the franchise industry and result in qualified and focused franchisees operating their stores 

  

franchise agreements 

  

we enter into franchise agreements with domestic franchisees under which the franchisee is granted the right to operate a store in a particular location for a term of ten years with an option to renew for an additional ten years we currently have a franchise contract renewal rate of over 99 under the current standard franchise agreement we assign an exclusive area of primary responsibility to each franchise store during the term of the franchise agreement the franchisee is required to pay a 55 royalty fee on sales subject in limited instances to lower rates based on area development agreements sales initiatives and new store incentives we have the contractual right subject to state law to terminate a franchise agreement for a variety of reasons including but not limited to a franchisee’s failure to make required payments when due or failure to adhere to specified company policies and standards 

  

franchise store development 

  

we provide domestic franchisees with assistance in selecting store sites and conforming the space to the physical specifications required for our stores each domestic franchisee selects the location and design for each store subject to our approval based on accessibility and visibility of the site and demographic factors including population density and anticipated traffic levels we provide design plans and sell fixtures and equipment for most of our franchise stores 

  

franchise training and support 

  

training store managers and employees is a critical component of our success we require all domestic franchisees to complete initial and ongoing training programs provided by us in addition under the standard domestic franchise agreement domestic franchisees are required to implement training programs for their store employees we assist our domestic and international franchisees by making training materials available to them for their use in training store managers and employees including computerbased training materials comprehensive operations manuals and franchise development classes we also maintain communications with our franchisees online and through various newsletters 

  

franchise operations 

  

we enforce stringent standards over franchise operations to protect our brand name all franchisees are required to operate their stores in compliance with written policies standards and specifications which include matters such as menu items ingredients materials supplies services furnishings decor and signs each franchisee has full discretion to determine the prices to be charged to customers we also provide ongoing support to our franchisees including training marketing assistance and consultation to franchisees who experience financial or operational difficulties we have established several advisory boards through which franchisees contribute to developing systemwide initiatives 

  

international franchisees 

  

the vast majority of our franchisees outside of the contiguous united states are master franchisees with franchise and distribution rights for entire regions or countries in select regions or countries we franchise directly to individual store operators our master franchise agreements generally grant the franchisee exclusive rights to develop or subfranchise stores and the right to operate distribution centers in a particular geographic area for a term of ten to 20 years with an option to renew for an additional tenyear term the agreements typically contain growth clauses requiring franchisees to open a minimum number of stores within a specified period prospective master franchisees are required to possess or have access to local market knowledge required to establish and develop domino’s pizza stores the local market knowledge focuses on the ability to identify and access targeted real estate sites along with expertise in local customs culture consumer behavior and laws we also seek candidates that have access to sufficient capital to meet their growth and development plans the master franchisee is generally required to pay an initial onetime franchise fee based on the size of the market covered by the master franchise agreement as well as an additional franchise fee upon the opening of each new store in addition the master franchisee is required to pay a continuing royalty fee as a percentage of retail sales which varies among international markets 

  

domino’s image campaign 

  

we have implemented a reimaging campaign aimed at increasing retail sales and market share through improved brand visibility this campaign involves relocating selected stores upgrading store interiors adding new store signs to draw attention to the stores and providing more contemporary uniforms for employees if a store is already in a desirable location the store signs and carryout areas are updated as needed as of january 2 2005 approximately 93 of our domestic stores had been reimaged or relocated as part of this campaign including significantly all of our domestic companyowned stores we plan to continue to reimage and relocate our domestic stores until each store meets our new image standards 

  

marketing operations 

  

we require domestic stores to contribute 3 of their retail sales to fund national marketing and advertising campaigns beginning in 2005 we require domestic stores to contribute 4 of their retail sales to fund national marketing and advertising campaigns in addition to the required national advertising contributions in those markets where we have cooperative advertising programs we generally require stores to contribute a minimum of 1 to 2 of their retail sales to market level media campaigns these funds are administered by domino’s national advertising fund inc or dnaf our notforprofit advertising subsidiary the funds remitted to dnaf are used primarily to purchase television advertising but also support market research field communications commercial production talent payments and other activities supporting the domino’s pizza ® brand dnaf also provides costeffective print materials to franchisees for use in local marketing that reinforce our national branding strategy in addition to the national and market level advertising contributions domestic stores spend additional amounts on local store marketing including targeted database mailings saturation print mailings and community involvement through school and civic organizations 

  

by communicating a common brand message at the national local market and store levels we create and reinforce a powerful consistent marketing message to consumers this is evidenced by our successful marketing campaign with the slogan “get the door it’s domino’s ® ” over the past five years we estimate that domestic stores have invested approximately 13 billion on national local and cooperative advertising 

  

internationally marketing efforts are primarily the responsibility of the franchisee in each local market we assist international franchisees with their marketing efforts through marketing workshops and knowledge sharing of best practices 

  

suppliers 

  

we have maintained active relationships of 15 years or more with more than half of our major suppliers our suppliers are required to meet strict quality standards to ensure food safety we review and evaluate our suppliers’ quality assurance programs through among other actions onsite visits to ensure compliance with our standards we believe that the length and quality of our relationships with suppliers provides us with priority service and quality products at competitive prices 

  

we believe that two factors have been critical to maintaining longlasting relationships and keeping our purchasing costs low first we are one of the largest domestic volume purchasers of pizzarelated products such as flour cheese sauce and pizza boxes which allows us to maximize leverage with our suppliers second we use a combination of singlesource and multisource procurement strategies each supply category is evaluated along a number of criteria including value of purchasing leverage consistency of quality and reliability of supply to determine the appropriate number of suppliers 

  

we currently purchase our cheese from a single supplier pursuant to a requirements contract that provides for pricing based on volume our cheese cost is based on the market price of cheese plus a supplier margin the supplier margin can be reduced if certain volume purchase levels are reached once a volume purchase level is reached the supplier margin is reduced and can only be further reduced in the future based upon attainment of higher volume purchase levels the supplier agreement is terminable by us upon 90 days prior written notice our chicken meat toppings and crunchy thin crust dough products are currently sourced by another single supplier pursuant to requirements contracts that expire in 2009 we have the right to terminate these requirements contracts for quality failures and for uncured breaches 

  

we believe that alternative suppliers for all of these ingredients are available and all of our other dough ingredients boxes and sauces are sourced from multiple suppliers while we would likely incur additional costs if we are required to replace any of our suppliers we do not believe that such additional costs would have a material adverse effect on our business we have also entered into a multiyear agreement with cocacola effective january 1 2003 for the contiguous united states the contract provides for cocacola to be our exclusive beverage supplier and expires on the later of december 31 2009 or such time as a minimum number of cases of cocacola ® products are purchased by us we continually evaluate each supply category to determine the optimal sourcing strategy 

  

we have not experienced any significant shortages of supplies or any delays in receiving our food or beverage inventories restaurant supplies or products prices charged to us by our suppliers are subject to fluctuation and we have historically been able to pass increased costs and savings on to our stores we do not engage in commodity hedging 

  

competition 

  

us and international pizza delivery and carryout are highly competitive domestically we compete against regional and local companies as well as national chains including pizza hut ® and papa john’s ®  internationally we compete against pizza hut ® and regional and local companies we generally compete on the basis of product quality location delivery time service and price we also compete on a broader scale with quick service and other international national regional and local restaurants in addition the overall food service industry and the qsr sector in particular are intensely competitive with respect to product quality price service convenience and concept the industry is often affected by changes in consumer tastes economic conditions demographic trends and consumers’ disposable income we compete within the food service industry and the qsr sector not only for customers but also for personnel suitable real estate sites and qualified franchisees 

  

government regulation 

  

we are subject to various federal state and local laws affecting the operation of our business as are our franchisees including various health sanitation fire and safety standards each store is subject to licensing and regulation by a number of governmental authorities which include zoning health safety sanitation building and fire agencies in the jurisdiction in which the store is located in connection with the reimaging of our stores we may be required to expend funds to meet certain federal state and local regulations including regulations requiring that remodeled or altered stores be accessible to persons with disabilities difficulties in obtaining or the failure to obtain required licenses or approvals could delay or prevent the opening of a new store in a particular area or cause an existing store to cease operations our distribution facilities are licensed and subject to similar regulations by federal state and local health and fire codes 

  

we are also subject to the fair labor standards act and various other laws governing such matters as minimum wage requirements overtime and other working conditions and citizenship requirements a significant number of our food service personnel are paid at rates related to the federal minimum wage and past increases in the minimum wage have increased our labor costs as would future increases 

  

we are subject to the rules and regulations of the federal trade commission and various state laws regulating the offer and sale of franchises the federal trade commission and various state laws require that we furnish a franchise offering circular containing certain information to prospective franchisees and a number of states require registration of the franchise offering circular with state authorities we are operating under exemptions from registration in several states based on the net worth of our operating subsidiary domino’s pizza llc and experience substantive state laws that regulate the franchisorfranchisee relationship presently exist in a substantial number of states and bills have been introduced in congress from time to time that would provide for federal regulation of the franchisorfranchisee relationship the state laws often limit among other things the duration and scope of noncompetition provisions the ability of a franchisor to terminate or refuse to renew a franchise and the ability of a franchisor to designate sources of supply we believe that our uniform franchise offering circular together with any applicable state versions or supplements and franchising procedures comply in all material respects with both the federal trade commission guidelines and all applicable state laws regulating franchising in those states in which we have offered franchises 

  

internationally our franchise stores are subject to national and local laws and regulations that often are similar to those affecting our domestic stores including laws and regulations concerning franchises labor health sanitation and safety our international franchise stores are also often subject to tariffs and regulations on imported commodities and equipment and laws regulating foreign investment we believe that our international disclosure statements franchise offering documents and franchising procedures comply in all material respects with the laws of the foreign countries in which we have offered franchises 

  

trademarks 

  

we have many registered trademarks and service marks and believe that the domino’s ® mark and domino’s pizza ® names and logos in particular have significant value and are important to our business our policy is to pursue registration of our trademarks and to vigorously oppose the infringement of any of our trademarks we license the use of our registered marks to franchisees through franchise agreements 

  

environmental matters 

  

we are not aware of any federal state or local environmental laws or regulations that will materially affect our earnings or competitive position or result in material capital expenditures however we cannot predict the effect of possible future environmental legislation or regulations during 2004 there were no material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities and no such material expenditures are anticipated in 2005 

  

employees 

  

as of january 2 2005 we had approximately 13500 employees who we refer to as team members in our companyowned stores dough manufacturing and distribution centers world resource center our corporate headquarters and zone offices as franchisees are independent business owners they and their employees are not included in our employee count we consider our relationship with our employees and franchisees to be good we estimate the total number of people who work in the domino’s pizza system including our employees franchisees and the employees of franchisees was approximately 145000 as of january 2 2005 

  

none of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement other than statutorily mandated programs in european countries where we operate 

  

driver safety 

  

our commitment to safety is embodied in our hiring training and review process before an applicant is considered for hire as a delivery driver motor vehicle records are reviewed to ensure a minimum twoyear safe driving record in addition we require regular checks of driving records and proof of insurance for delivery drivers throughout their employment with us each domino’s driver including drivers employed by franchisees must complete our safe delivery training program we have also implemented several companywide safe driving incentive programs 

  

our safety and security department oversees security matters for our stores regional security and safety directors oversee security measures at store locations and assist local authorities in investigations of incidents involving our stores or personnel 

  

community activities 

  

we believe in supporting the communities we serve this is evidenced by our strong support of the domino’s pizza partners foundation the foundation is a separate notforprofit organization that was established in 1986 to assist domino’s pizza team members in times of tragedy and special need over the past two years we and our employees and franchisees contributed over 26 million to the foundation’s efforts and since its inception the foundation has supplied millions of dollars to team members in need

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

  

overview 

  

our fiscal year typically includes 52 weeks comprised of three twelve week quarters and one sixteen week quarter every five or six years our fiscal year includes an extra or 53 rd  week fiscal 2004 consisted of 53 weeks while fiscal 2002 and fiscal 2003 consisted of 52 weeks 

  

we are the number one pizza delivery company in the united states with a 195 share based on reported consumer spending we also have a leading international presence we operate through a network of 601 companyowned stores substantially all of which are in the united states and 7156 franchise stores located in all 50 states and in more than 50 countries in addition we operate 18 regional dough manufacturing and distribution centers in the contiguous united states as well as eight dough manufacturing and distribution centers outside the contiguous united states 

  

in 2004 domino’s pizza inc completed its initial public offering as part of the ipo we issued and sold 9375000 shares of common stock resulting in net proceeds to us of approximately 1196 million we used a significant amount of these net proceeds to pay down debt also in the ipo existing shareholders sold an aggregate of 14846929 shares of common stock we did not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares by the selling shareholders 

  

our financial results are driven largely by changes in retail sales at our companyowned and franchise stores changes in retail sales are driven by changes in same store sales and store counts we monitor both of these metrics very closely as they directly impact our revenues and profits and strive to consistently increase the related amounts retail sales drive companyowned store revenues royalty payments from franchisees and distribution revenues retail sales are primarily impacted by the strength of the domino’s pizza ® brand the success of our marketing promotions and our ability to execute our store operating model and other business strategies in 2004 global retail sales increased 105 as compared to the prior year boosted by the 53 rd week in 2004 which accounted for approximately 2 percentage points of the increase 

  

we earn a significant portion of our income from our franchisees through royalty payments and distribution earnings as well as earnings from our companyowned stores we believe that the investment performance of our stores to their owners which we refer to as store economics benefits from the relatively small investment required to own and operate a domino’s pizza store we believe these favorable investment requirements coupled with a strong brand message supported by significant advertising spending as well as highquality and focused menu offerings drive store economics which in turn drive same store sales growth and demand for new stores we pay particular attention to the store economics of both our companyowned and franchise stores 

  

we are highly leveraged as the result of recapitalizations in 1998 and 2003 since 1998 a large portion of our cash flows provided from operations has been used to make principal and interest payments on our indebtedness we subsequently amended our senior secured credit facility to provide for reduced principal payments in the earlier years of the credit facility exclusive of excess cash flow sweep provisions as more fully described in the “liquidity and capital resources” section included in this “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” section our senior subordinated notes require no principal payments until maturity in 2011 as of january 2 2005 consolidated longterm debt was 7807 million we have decreased our total leverage ratio total debt divided by total segment income from 47x to 36x over the past year as a result of strong operating cash flows and proceeds from the ipo 

  

we devote significant attention to our brandbuilding efforts which is evident in our system’s estimated 13 billion of domestic advertising spending over the past five years and our frequent designation as a megabrand by advertising age  we plan on continuing to build our brand by satisfying customers worldwide with our pizza delivery offerings and by continuing to invest significant amounts in the advertising and marketing of the domino’s pizza ® brand 

  

our revenues have increased over the past three years as a result of higher store counts increases in same store sales and increases in distribution sales worldwide store counts have increased from 7072 at the beginning of 2002 to 7757 at the end of 2004 this growth in store counts can be attributed to the growing global acceptance of our brand and our pizza delivery concept as well as the economics inherent in our system which attracts new franchisees and encourages existing franchisees to grow their business domestic same store sales increased 26 13 and 18 in 2002 2003 and 2004 respectively international same store sales increased 41 40 and 59 respectively the consistent domestic same store sales increases have been a result of several new products domino’s philly cheese steak pizza and domino’s doublemelt ™  as well as strong promotional activities internationally same stores sales growth continues to result from the overall acceptance of delivered pizza around the globe 

  

income from operations has increased from 1578 million in 2002 to 1714 million in 2004 this growth in income from operations was primarily the result of increases in store counts and same store sales related profits from distribution center operations and the positive effect of lowering our general and administrative costs as a percentage of consolidated revenues due to management’s continued focus on controlling overhead costs 

  

net income increased from 605 million in 2002 to 623 million in 2004 the 2004 net income amount included 227 million of pretax expenses incurred in connection with our ipo 

  

critical accounting policies and estimates 

  

the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america the preparation of these financial statements requires our management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis our management evaluates its estimates including those related to revenue recognition allowance for uncollectible receivables longlived and intangible assets insurance and legal matters and income taxes we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from those estimates changes in our estimates could materially impact our results of operations and financial condition for any particular period we believe that our most critical accounting policies are 

  

revenue recognition  we earn revenues through our network of domestic companyowned and franchise stores dough manufacturing and distribution centers and international operations retail sales from companyowned stores and royalty revenues resulting from the retail sales from franchise stores are recognized as revenues when the items are delivered to or carried out by customers sales of food from our distribution centers are recognized as revenues upon delivery of the food to franchisees while sales of equipment and supplies from our distribution centers are generally recognized as revenues upon shipment of the related products to franchisees 

  

allowance for uncollectible receivables we closely monitor our accounts and notes receivable balances and provide allowances for uncollectible amounts as a result of our reviews these estimates are based on among other factors historical collection experience and a review of our receivables by aging category additionally we may also provide allowances for uncollectible receivables based on specific customer collection issues that we have identified while writeoffs of bad debts have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established management cannot guarantee that future writeoffs will not exceed historical rates specifically if the financial condition of our franchisees were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments additional allowances may be required 

  

longlived and intangible assets we record longlived assets including property plant and equipment and capitalized software at cost for acquisitions of franchise operations we estimate the fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired based on physical inspection of assets historical experience and other information available to us regarding the acquisition we depreciate and amortize longlived assets using useful lives determined by us based on historical experience and other information available to us we review longlived assets for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that the related amounts might be impaired we perform related impairment tests on a market level basis for companyowned stores at january 2 2005 we determined that our longlived assets were not impaired however if our future operating performance were to deteriorate we may be required to recognize an impairment charge 

  

we evaluate goodwill for impairment by comparing the fair value of our reporting units to their carrying values a significant portion of our goodwill relates to acquisitions of domestic franchise stores and is included in our domestic stores segment at january 2 2005 the fair value of our companyowned stores exceeded its recorded carrying value including the related goodwill however if the future performance of our domestic companyowned stores were to deteriorate we may be required to recognize a goodwill impairment charge 

  

insurance and legal matters we are a party to lawsuits and legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business management closely monitors these legal matters and estimates the probable costs for the resolution of such matters these estimates are primarily determined by consulting with both internal and external parties handling the matters and are based upon an analysis of potential results assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies if our estimates relating to legal matters proved inaccurate for any reason we may be required to increase or decrease the related expense in future periods 

  

for certain periods prior to december 1998 and for periods after december 2001 we maintain insurance coverage for workers’ compensation general liability and owned and nonowned auto liability under insurance policies requiring payment of a deductible for each occurrence up to between 500000 and 30 million depending on the policy year and line of coverage the related insurance reserves are determined using actuarial estimates which are based on historical information along with assumptions about future events changes in assumptions for such factors as medical costs and legal actions as well as changes in actual experience could cause these estimates to change in the near term which could result in an increase or decrease in the related expense in future periods 

  

income taxes our net deferred tax assets assume that we will generate sufficient taxable income in specific tax jurisdictions based on estimates and assumptions the amounts relating to taxes recorded on the balance sheet including tax reserves also consider the ultimate resolution of revenue agent reviews based on estimates and assumptions if these estimates and assumptions change in the future we may be required to adjust our valuation allowance or other tax reserves resulting in additional income tax expense or benefit in future periods

liquidity and capital resources 

  

as of january 2 2005 we had negative working capital of 02 million and cash and cash equivalents of 404 million historically we have operated with minimal positive working capital or negative working capital primarily because our receivable collection periods and inventory turn rates are faster than the normal payment terms on our current liabilities we generally collect our receivables within three weeks from the date of the related sale and we generally experience 40 to 50 inventory turns per year in addition our sales are not typically seasonal which further limits our working capital requirements these factors coupled with significant and ongoing cash flows from operations which are primarily used to repay longterm debt pay dividends and invest in longterm assets reduce our working capital amounts our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations and availability of borrowings under our revolving credit facility we have historically funded capital expenditures and debt repayments from cash flows from operations and expect to in the future we did not have any material commitments for capital expenditures as of january 2 2005 

  

as of january 2 2005 we had 7807 million of longterm debt of which 253 million was classified as a current liability during 2004 there were no borrowings under our revolving credit facility letters of credit issued under our 1250 million revolving credit facility were 255 million these letters of credit are primarily related to our insurance programs and distribution center leases borrowings under the revolving credit facility are available to fund our working capital requirements capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes 

  

cash provided by operating activities was 1135 million and 1032 million in 2004 and 2003 respectively the 103 million increase was due primarily to a 233 million increase in net income and a 38 million decrease in gains on the saledisposal of assets these increases were offset in part by a 129 million decrease in amortization of deferred financing costs and debt discount and a 54 million net change in operating assets and liabilities 

  

cash used in investing activities was 363 million and 196 million in 2004 and 2003 respectively the 167 million increase was due primarily to a 106 million increase in capital expenditures and a 79 million decrease in repayments of notes receivable net the increase in capital expenditures related to the renovation of our corporate headquarters 

  

cash used in financing activities was 839 million and 629 million in 2004 and 2003 respectively the 210 million increase was due primarily to net cash used in our ipo in 2004 exceeding the net cash used in our recapitalization in 2003 in connection with our ipo in 2004 we received net proceeds from the issuance of common stock of approximately 1196 million we used these net proceeds and cash from operations to repurchase approximately 1091 million of senior subordinated notes and repay approximately 169 million of notes payable to our founder and former majority stockholder and a member of his family additionally during 2004 we repaid approximately 716 million of additional debt obligations and paid 45 million in dividends to our shareholders in connection with our recapitalization in 2003 we received proceeds from the issuance of longterm debt of approximately 10 billion we used these proceeds to repay approximately 3623 million outstanding under our then existing credit facility repurchase approximately 2067 million of senior subordinated notes retire our preferred stock for approximately 2006 million pay 1883 million in dividends to our shareholders and pay approximately 200 million of financing fees during 2003 we also repaid approximately 935 million of additional debt obligations

the senior subordinated notes require semiannual interest payments beginning january 1 2004 before july 1 2007 we may at a price above par redeem all but not part of the senior subordinated notes if a change in control occurs as defined in the indenture governing the notes beginning july 1 2007 we may redeem some or all of the senior subordinated notes at fixed redemption prices ranging from 104125 of par in 2007 to 100 of par in 2009 through maturity in the event of a change in control as defined we will be obligated to repurchase the senior subordinated notes tendered at the option of the holders at a fixed price upon a public stock offering we may use the net proceeds from such offering to repurchase and retire up to 40 of the aggregate principal amount of the senior subordinated notes due 2011 provided that at least 60 of the original principal amount of the senior subordinated notes due 2011 remains outstanding immediately following the repurchase during 2004 we used the net proceeds from our ipo to redeem approximately 1091 million in principal amount of our senior subordinated notes the senior subordinated notes are guaranteed by most of domino’s inc’s domestic subsidiaries and one foreign subsidiary and are subordinated in right of payment to all existing and future senior debt of the company

in connection with our ipo we amended our senior secured credit facility and obtained consent under the facility to permit the use of proceeds described in our offering prospectus filed with the securities and exchange commission the final scheduled principal payment on the outstanding borrowings under the term loan is due in june 2010

based upon our current level of operations and anticipated growth we believe that the cash generated from our operations and amounts available under our revolving credit facility will be adequate to meet our anticipated debt service requirements including payments required under the excess cash flow provisions of our senior secured credit facility capital expenditures and working capital needs for the next several years we believe that we will be able to meet these obligations even if we experience no growth in sales or profits our ability to continue to fund these items and continue to reduce debt could be adversely affected by the occurrence of any of the events described in exhibit 991 “risk factors” there can be no assurance however that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operations or that future borrowings will be available under our revolving credit facility or otherwise to enable us to service our indebtedness including our senior secured credit facility and senior subordinated notes or to make anticipated capital expenditures our future operating performance and our ability to service or refinance the senior subordinated notes and to service extend or refinance the senior secured credit facility will be subject to future economic conditions and to financial business and other factors many of which are beyond our control 

  

impact of inflation 

  

we believe that our results of operations are not materially impacted upon moderate changes in the inflation rate inflation and changing prices did not have a material impact on our operations in 2002 2003 or 2004 severe increases in inflation however could affect the global and us economies and could have an adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations

we are also exposed to market risks from changes in commodity prices during the normal course of business we purchase cheese and certain other food products that are affected by changes in commodity prices and as a result we are subject to volatility in our food costs we do not enter into financial instruments to hedge commodity prices we purchase cheese at market prices which fluctuate on a daily basis the cheese block price per pound averaged 131 and 164 in 2003 and 2004 respectively the estimated change in companyowned store food costs from a hypothetical 025 change in the average cheese block price per pound would have been approximately 38 million in 2004 this hypothetical change in food cost could be positively or negatively impacted by average ticket changes and product mix changes 

  

financial derivatives 

  

we enter into interest rate swaps collars or similar instruments with the objective of reducing volatility relating to our borrowing costs in addition to fulfilling requirements under our debt agreements

we had total interest expense of approximately 611 million in 2004 the estimated increase in interest expense for this period from a hypothetical 200 basis point adverse change in applicable variable interest rates would be approximately 71 million 

  

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

  

we have exposure to various foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations for revenues generated by our operations outside the united states which can adversely impact our net income and cash flows approximately 7 and 8 of our revenues in 2003 and 2004 respectively were derived from sales to customers and royalties from franchisees outside the contiguous united states this business is conducted in the local currency we do not enter into financial instruments to manage this foreign currency exchange risk
