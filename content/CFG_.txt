competition 

the financial services industry is highly competitive our branch footprint is in the new england midatlantic and midwest regions though certain lines of business serve national markets within these markets we face competition from community banks superregional and national financial institutions credit unions savings and loan associations mortgage banking firms consumer finance companies securities brokerage firms insurance companies money market funds hedge funds and private equity firms some of our larger competitors may make available to their customers a broader array of products pricing and structure alternatives while some smaller competitors may have more liberal lending policies and processes competition among providers of financial products and services continues to increase with consumers having the opportunity to select from a growing variety of traditional and nontraditional alternatives the ability of nonbanking financial institutions including fintech companies to provide services previously limited to commercial banks has also intensified competition 

in consumer banking the industry has become increasingly dependent on and oriented toward technologydriven delivery systems permitting transactions to be conducted through telephone online and mobile channels in addition technology has lowered barriers to entry and made it possible for nonbank institutions to attract funds and provide lending and other financial products and services the emergence of digitalonly banking models has increased and we expect this trend to continue given their lower cost structure these models are often on average able to offer higher rates on deposit products than retail banking institutions with a traditional branch footprint the primary factors driving competition for loans and deposits are interest rates fees charged tailored value propositions to different customer segments customer service levels convenience including branch locations and hours of operation and the range of products and services offered 

in commercial banking there is intense competition for quality loan originations from traditional banking institutions particularly large regional banks as well as commercial finance companies leasing companies other nonbank lenders institutional investors including collateralized loan obligation managers hedge funds and private equity firms some larger competitors including certain national banks that compete in our market area may offer a broader array of products and due to their asset size may sometimes be in a position to hold more exposure on their balance sheet we compete on a number of factors including providing innovative corporate finance solutions quality of customer service and execution range of products offered price and reputation 

human capital management 

we believe that our longterm success depends on our ability to attract develop and retain a highperforming workforce our ultimate goal is to create an environment where colleagues can thrive and maximize their potential as of december 31 2021 citizens and its subsidiaries had 17463 fulltime equivalent employees primarily across new england and the midatlantic our board and the compensation and human resources committee provide oversight of our human capital strategy and programs with senior management providing regular updates on human capital matters to facilitate that oversight 

health and wellbeing 

we are committed to supporting the health and wellbeing of our colleagues and their loved ones we offer a competitive and comprehensive benefits program which was complemented with several additional elements during 2020 to support colleagues’ physical financial and mental wellness during the pandemic those programs included additional paid time off to address personal circumstances and for covid19 quarantine and recovery mental health and parental resources and modifications to select compensation programs to take into consideration decreased production at the onset of the crisis we continuously evaluate our programs and in 2021 implemented additional mental and emotional health resources as well as emergency backup child and adult care in order to help alleviate the stress associated with unexpected circumstances in addition in early 2022 we paid our branch colleagues a 500 bonus to recognize their continued dedication to serving our customers 

our commitment to colleague health and wellbeing has also driven our return to office strategy while our branch staff have been serving customers inperson throughout the covid19 pandemic we have implemented a gradual return to office strategy for nonbranch colleagues which incorporates flexibility for colleagues based on their unique needs we also continue to implement heightened protocols in our branches and other work locations

fair and equitable compensation 

we strive to compensate our colleagues fairly based on market data experience and performance and we compare our compensation to other companies in our peer group as well as others in the financial services industry 

part of our commitment to building and fostering a diverse inclusive highperforming culture includes ensuring our compensation and benefits are fair and competitive for all colleagues we engage an independent thirdparty expert consulting firm to conduct an annual pay equity analysis to ensure equal pay is received for equal work throughout our organization accounting for factors that appropriately explain differences in pay such as performance time in role and experience additional information about this analysis can be found on our website and in our corporate responsibility report 

colleague growth and development

employee engagement 

as part of our continuous efforts to make citizens a great place to build a career we use mckinsey  company’s organizational health index “ohi” survey to understand colleagues’ viewpoints about the company on a wide range of factors in 2021 we maintained our strong overall ohi score despite the competitive talent market and had our highest response rate to date we use the results of this survey to refine our focus address any gaps and strengthen our efforts to improve our organizational effectiveness and colleague experience the ohi survey includes several questions focused on dei and the responses to these questions by various diverse 



colleague segments are reviewed in order to understand where action may be necessary to further inclusion efforts 

environmental social and governance 

investors have begun to consider how corporations are addressing environmental social and governance matters “esg” commonly known as “esg matters” when making investment decisions specifically certain investors are beginning to incorporate the business risks of climate change and the adequacy of companies’ responses to climate change and other esg matters as part of their investment strategy 

we adopted targets to reduce our scope 1 and 2 green house gas emissions 30 percent by 2025 and 50 by 2035 based on our 2016 baseline these reductions align with the recommendations of the paris agreement which aims to limit average global temperature increase to well below 2 degrees celsius compared to preindustrial levels as of december 31 2021 we were invested in approximately 429 million in renewable energy projects we launched a green deposits program allowing corporate clients to direct their cash reserves toward companies and projects that are expected to create a positive environmental impact as of december 31 2021 there was 107 million on deposit in this program 

we continued our progress on our 10 million social equity commitment and our 500 million commitment to providing access to capital in minority communities as of december 31 2021 we contributed 250000 to social equity organizations and 250000 to local lisc centers for digital inclusion programs and partnered with goalsetter on one stock one future campaign to help bridge the wealth gap affecting communities of color by introducing investments and financial education as critical components to building generational wealth additionally we are on track to provide 146 billion in financing to help lowtomoderate income borrowers gain access to capital

regulation and supervision 

our operations are subject to extensive regulation supervision and examination under federal and state laws and regulations these laws and regulations cover all aspects of our business including lending practices deposit insurance customer privacy and cybersecurity capital adequacy and planning liquidity safety and soundness consumer protection and disclosure permissible activities and investments and certain transactions with affiliates these laws and regulations are intended primarily for the protection of depositors the deposit insurance fund and the banking system as a whole and not for the protection of shareholders or other investors the discussion below outlines the material elements of selected laws and regulations applicable to us and our subsidiaries changes in applicable law or regulation and in their interpretation and application by regulatory agencies and other governmental authorities cannot be predicted but may have a material effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

we are subject to examinations by federal banking regulators as well as the sec finra and various state insurance and securities regulators in some cases regulatory agencies may take supervisory actions that may not be publicly disclosed and such actions may restrict or limit our activities or activities of our subsidiaries as part of our regular examination process regulators may advise us to operate under various restrictions as a prudential matter we have periodically received requests for information from regulatory authorities at the federal and state level including from banking securities and insurance regulators state attorneys general federal agencies or law enforcement authorities and other regulatory authorities concerning our business practices such requests are considered incidental to the normal conduct of business for a further discussion of how regulatory actions may impact our business see item 1a “risk factors” for additional information regarding regulatory matters see note 25 in item 8 



overview 

we are a bank holding company under the bank holding company act we have elected to be treated as a financial holding company under amendments to the bank holding company act as effected by glba as such we are subject to the supervision examination and reporting requirements of the bank holding company act and the regulations of the frb including through the federal reserve bank of boston under the system of “functional regulation” established under the bank holding company act the frb serves as the primary regulator of our consolidated organization the occ and the sec serve as the primary regulators of cbna and our brokerdealer and investment advisory subsidiaries respectively and directly regulate the activities of those subsidiaries with the frb exercising a supervisory role 

the federal banking regulators have authority to approve or disapprove mergers acquisitions consolidations the establishment of branches and similar corporate actions these banking regulators also have the power to prevent the continuance or development of unsafe or unsound banking practices or other violations of law federal law governs the activities in which cbna engages including the investments it makes and the aggregate amount of available credit that it may grant to one borrower various consumer and compliance laws and regulations also affect its operations the actions the frb takes to implement monetary policy also affect cbna 

in addition cbna is subject to regulation supervision and examination by the cfpb with respect to consumer protection laws and regulations the cfpb has broad authority to regulate the offering and provision of consumer financial products by depository institutions such as cbna with more than 10 billion in total assets the cfpb may promulgate rules under a variety of consumer financial protection statutes including the truth in lending act the electronic funds transfer act and the real estate settlement procedures act 

tailoring of prudential requirements 

in october 2019 the frb and the other federal banking regulators finalized rules that tailor the application of the enhanced prudential standards to bank holding companies and depository institutions to implement the economic growth regulatory relief and consumer protection act of 2018 amendments to the doddfrank act “tailoring rules” under the tailoring rules we are subject to “category iv standards” which apply to banking organizations with at least 100 billion in total consolidated assets that do not meet any of the thresholds specified for categories i through iii 

we discuss other elements of the tailoring rules where relevant below the liquidity requirements are described below under “—liquidity requirements” and the stress testing requirements are described below under “—capital planning and stress testing requirements” 

  bank and financial holding company regulation 

as a financial holding company we may engage in a broader range of activities than a bank holding company that is not also a financial holding company these activities include securities underwriting and dealing insurance underwriting and brokerage merchant banking and other activities that are determined by the frb in coordination with the treasury department to be “financial in nature or incidental thereto” or that the frb determines unilaterally to be “complementary” to financial activities in addition a financial holding company may commence new permissible financial activities or acquire nonbank financial companies engaged in such activities in either case with afterthefact notice to the frb 

to maintain our status as a financial holding company we and cbna our depository institution subsidiary must each remain “well capitalized” and “well managed” as described below under “federal deposit insurance act” if we or cbna fails to meet these regulatory standards the frb could place limitations on our ability to conduct the broader financial activities permissible for financial holding companies or impose limitations or conditions on the conduct or activities of us or our affiliates if the deficiencies persisted the frb could order us to divest any subsidiary bank or to cease engaging in any activities permissible for financial holding companies that are not permissible for bank holding companies or we could elect to conform our nonbanking activities to those permissible for a bank holding company that is not also a financial holding company in addition the cra requires us banks to help serve the needs of their communities if cbna were to receive a cra rating of less than “satisfactory” we and cbna would be prohibited from engaging in certain activities see “community reinvestment act” below 

federal and state laws impose notice and approval requirements for mergers and acquisitions of other depository institutions or bank holding companies as noted above frb approval is generally not required for us to acquire a company engaged in activities that are financial in nature or incidental to activities that are 



financial in nature as determined by the frb prior regulatory approval is required however before we may acquire or control more than 5 of any class of voting shares or substantially all of the assets of a bank holding company including a financial holding company or a bank in considering applications for approval of acquisitions the banking regulators may take several factors into account including the competitive effects of the transaction in the relevant geographic markets the financial and managerial resources and future prospects of companies involved in the transaction the effect of the transaction on the financial stability of the us banking or financial system the companies’ compliance with antimoney laundering laws and regulations the convenience and needs to the communities to be served and the records of performance under the cra of the insured depository institutions involved in the transaction 

capital 

the us basel iii rules apply to us these rules establish riskbased and leverage capital requirements the riskbased requirements are based on a banking organization’s riskweighted assets also known as rwa which reflect the organization’s on and offbalance sheet exposures subject to risk weights the leverage requirements are based on a banking organization’s average consolidated onbalance sheet assets for more detail on our regulatory capital see the “capital and regulatory matters” section of item 7 

we calculate rwa using the standardized approach and have made the onetime election to optout of aoci as a result we are not required to recognize in regulatory capital the impacts of net unrealized gains and losses included within aoci for debt securities that are available for sale or held to maturity accumulated net gains and losses on cash flow hedges and certain defined benefit pension plan assets 

on january 1 2020 we adopted the cecl accounting standard in reaction to the covid19 pandemic on september 30 2020 the frb and the other federal banking regulators adopted a final rule relative to regulatory capital treatment of acl under cecl this rule allowed electing banking organizations to delay the estimated impact of cecl on regulatory capital for a twoyear period ending january 1 2022 followed by a threeyear transition period ending january 1 2025 to phasein the reversal of the aggregate amount of the capital benefit provided during the initial twoyear delay 

under the us basel iii rules the minimum capital ratios are 

• 45 cet1 capital to riskweighted assets 

• 60 tier 1 capital that is cet1 capital plus additional tier 1 capital to riskweighted assets 

• 80 total capital that is tier 1 capital plus tier 2 capital to riskweighted assets and 

• 40 tier 1 capital to total average consolidated assets as defined under us basel iii standardized approach known as the “leverage ratio” 

in march 2020 the frb finalized rules that replaced the fixed ccb of 25 with a dynamic institutionspecific scb which is imposed on top of each of the three minimum riskweighted capital ratios listed above banking institutions that fail to meet the effective minimum ratios with the scb taken into account will be subject to constraints on capital distributions including dividends and share repurchases and certain discretionary executive compensation the severity of the constraints depends on the amount of the shortfall and the institution’s “eligible retained income” defined as the greater of four quarter trailing net income net of distributions and tax effects not reflected in net income or the average four quarter trailing net income the scb framework became effective for us on october 1 2020 with our scb of 34 for the period october 1 2020 through september 30 2021 based on the results of the 2020 doddfrank act stress test 

effective april 5 2021 the frb adopted a final rule to make conforming changes to its capital plan rule and stress capital buffer and capital planning requirements to be consistent with the tailoring rules framework under the final rule for category iv firms like us the scb will be recalibrated with each biennial supervisory stress test and updated annually to reflect our planned common stock dividends in addition category iv firms may elect to participate in the supervisory stress test and receive an updated scb requirement in a year in which they are not subject to the supervisory stress test we did not elect to participate in the 2021 supervisory stress test and on august 5 2021 the frb announced that our scb will remain unchanged at 34 from october 1 2021 through september 30 2022 for more details see “—capital planning and stress testing requirements” below and the “capital and regulatory matters” section of item 7 

we are also subject to the frbs riskbased capital requirements for market risk see the “market risk” section of item 7 



  liquidity requirements 

the federal banking regulators have adopted the basel iiibased us liquidity coverage ratio rule which is a quantitative liquidity metric designed to ensure that a covered bank or bank holding company maintains an adequate level of unencumbered highquality liquid assets to cover expected net cash outflows over a 30day time horizon under an acute liquidity stress scenario as noted above under the tailoring rules category iv firms with less than 50 billion in weighted shortterm wholesale funding including us are no longer subject to any liquidity coverage ratio requirement 

the basel iii framework also includes a second liquidity standard the nsfr which is designed to promote more medium and longterm funding of the assets and activities of banks over a oneyear time horizon on october 20 2020 the federal banking regulators issued a final rule to implement the nsfr for large us banking organizations under the final rule category iv firms with less than 50 billion in weighted shortterm wholesale funding including us are not subject to the nsfr requirement 

finally per the liquidity rules included in the frb’s enhanced prudential standards adopted pursuant to section 165 of the doddfrank act referred to above under “—tailoring of prudential requirements” we are also required to maintain a buffer of highly liquid assets based on projected funding needs for 30 days under the tailoring rules the liquidity buffer requirements continue to apply to category iv firms such as us and remain subject to liquidity risk management requirements however these requirements are now tailored such that we required to 

i calculate collateral positions monthly as opposed to weekly 

ii establish a more limited set of liquidity risk limits than was previously required and 

iii monitor fewer elements of intraday liquidity risk exposures than were previously monitored 

we are also now subject to liquidity stress testing quarterly rather than monthly and are required to report liquidity data on a monthly basis 

  capital planning and stress testing requirements 

under the tailoring rules category iv firms such as us are subject to biennial supervisory stress testing and are exempt from companyrun stress testing and related disclosure requirements category iv firms are also no longer required to submit resolution plans the frb continues to supervise category iv firms on an ongoing basis including evaluation of the capital adequacy and capital planning processes during offcycle years we remain subject to the requirement to develop maintain and submit an annual capital plan for review and approval by our board of directors or one of its committees as well as fr y14 reporting requirements 

regulations relating to capital planning regulatory reporting and stress testing and capital buffer requirements applicable to firms like us are presently subject to rule making and potential further guidance and interpretation by the applicable federal regulators we will continue to evaluate the impact of these and any other prudential regulatory changes including their potential resultant changes in our regulatory and compliance costs and expenses 

for more detail on our capital planning and stress testing requirements see the “capital and regulatory matters” section of item 7 

standards for safety and soundness 

the fdia requires the frb occ and fdic to prescribe operational and managerial standards for all insured depository institutions including cbna the agencies have adopted regulations and interagency guidelines that set forth the safety and soundness standards used to identify and address problems at insured depository institutions before capital becomes impaired if an agency determines that a bank fails to satisfy any standard it may require the bank to submit an acceptable plan to achieve compliance consistent with deadlines for the submission and review of such safety and soundness compliance plans if after being notified to submit a compliance plan an institution fails to submit an acceptable compliance plan or fails in any material respect to implement an acceptable compliance plan the agency must issue an order directing action to correct the deficiency and may issue an order directing other actions of the types to which an undercapitalized institution is subject under the fdia see “federal deposit insurance act” below if an institution fails to comply with such an order the agency may seek to enforce such order in judicial proceedings and to impose civil money penalties 



federal deposit insurance act 

the fdia requires among other things that the federal banking regulators take “prompt corrective action” with respect to depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements as described above in “capital” the fdia sets forth the following five capital categories “wellcapitalized” “adequately capitalized” “undercapitalized” “significantly undercapitalized” and “critically undercapitalized” a depository institution’s capital category depends upon how its capital levels compare with various relevant capital measures and certain other factors that are established by regulation the federal banking regulators must take certain mandatory supervisory actions and are authorized to take other discretionary actions with respect to institutions that are undercapitalized significantly undercapitalized or critically undercapitalized with the actions becoming more restrictive and punitive the lower the institution’s capital category under existing rules an institution that is not an advanced approaches institution is deemed to be “well capitalized” if it has a cet1 ratio of at least 65 a tier 1 capital ratio of at least 8 a total capital ratio of at least 10 and a tier 1 leverage ratio of at least 5 

the fdia’s prompt corrective action provisions only apply to depository institutions and not to bank holding companies the frb’s regulations applicable to bank holding companies separately define “well capitalized” for bank holding companies to require maintaining a tier 1 capital ratio of at least 6 and a total capital ratio of at least 10 as described above under “—bank and financial holding company regulation” a financial holding company that is not wellcapitalized and wellmanaged or whose bank subsidiaries are not well capitalized and well managed under applicable prompt corrective action standards may be restricted in certain of its activities and ultimately may lose financial holding company status as of december 31 2021 both the parent company and cbna were wellcapitalized 

the fdia prohibits insured banks from accepting brokered deposits or offering interest rates on any deposits significantly higher than the prevailing rate in the bank’s normal market area or nationally depending upon where the deposits are solicited unless it is “wellcapitalized” or it is “adequately capitalized” and receives a waiver from the fdic a bank that is “adequately capitalized” and accepts brokered deposits under a waiver from the fdic may not pay an interest rate on any deposit in excess of 75 basis points over certain prevailing market rates the fdia imposes no such restrictions on a bank that is “wellcapitalized” 

deposit insurance 

the fdia requires cbna to pay deposit insurance assessments fdic assessment rates for large institutions are calculated based on one of two scorecards one for most large institutions that have more than 10 billion in assets and another for “highly complex” institutions that have over 50 billion in assets and are fully owned by a parent with over 500 billion in assets each scorecard has a performance score and a lossseverity score that are combined to produce a total score which is translated into an initial assessment rate in calculating these scores the fdic utilizes the camels ratings and forwardlooking financial measures to assess an institution’s ability to withstand assetrelated stress and fundingrelated stress the fdic has the ability to make discretionary adjustments to the total score based upon significant risk factors that are not adequately captured in the scorecard the total score is then translated to an initial base assessment rate on a nonlinear sharplyincreasing scale 

the deposit insurance assessment is calculated based on average consolidated total assets less average tangible equity of the insured depository institution during the assessment period deposit insurance assessments are also affected by the minimum reserve ratio with respect to the deposit insurance fund “dif” the fdia established a minimum reserve ratio of the dif of 115 prior to september 2020 and 135 thereafter as of september 30 2021 the reserve ratio of the dif was 127 on september 15 2020 the fdic’s board of directors voted to adopt a restoration plan to restore the dif reserve ratio to at least 135 within 8 years as required by the fdia 

dividends 

various federal statutory provisions and regulations as well as regulatory expectations limit the amount of dividends that we and our subsidiaries may pay 

our payment of dividends to our stockholders is subject to the oversight of the frb in particular the frb reviews the dividend policies and share repurchases of a large bank holding company based on capital plans submitted as part of the ccar process and on the results of stress tests as discussed above in addition to other limitations our ability to make any capital distributions including dividends and share repurchases is contingent on the frb’s nonobjection to such planned distributions included in our submitted capital plan or the frb’s 



authorization to make distributions if we are exempt from the requirement to submit a capital plan see “—capital” and “—capital planning and stress testing requirements” above 

dividends payable by cbna as a national bank subsidiary are limited to the lesser of the amount calculated under a “recent earnings” test and an “undivided profits” test under the recent earnings test a dividend may not be paid if the total of all dividends declared by a bank in any calendar year is in excess of the current year’s net income combined with the retained net income of the two preceding years less any required transfers to surplus unless the national bank obtains the approval of the occ under the undivided profits test a dividend may not be paid in excess of the entity’s “undivided profits” generally accumulated net profits that have not been paid out as dividends or transferred to surplus federal bank regulatory agencies have issued policy statements that provide that fdicinsured depository institutions and their holding companies should generally pay dividends only out of their current operating earnings 

support of subsidiary bank 

under section 616 of the doddfrank act which codifies the frb’s longstanding “source of strength” doctrine the parent company must serve as a source of financial and managerial strength for our depository institution subsidiary the statute defines “source of financial strength” as the ability to provide financial assistance in the event of the financial distress at the insured depository institution the frb may require that the parent company provide such support at times even when the parent company may not have the financial resources to do so or when doing so may not serve our interests or those of our shareholders or creditors in addition any capital loans by a bank holding company to its subsidiary bank are subordinate in right of payment to deposits and to certain other indebtedness of such subsidiary bank in the event of a bank holding company’s bankruptcy any commitment by the bank holding company to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to a priority of payment 

transactions with affiliates and insiders 

sections 23a and 23b of the federal reserve act and related frb rules including regulation w restrict cbna from extending credit to or engaging in certain other transactions with the parent company and its nonbank subsidiaries these restrictions place limits on certain specified “covered transactions” between bank subsidiaries and their affiliates which must be limited to 10 of a bank’s capital and surplus for any one affiliate and 20 for all affiliates furthermore within the foregoing limitations as to amount certain covered transactions must meet specified collateral requirements ranging from 100 to 130 covered transactions are defined to include among other things a loan or extension of credit as well as a purchase of securities issued by an affiliate a purchase of assets unless otherwise exempted by the frb from the affiliate the acceptance of securities issued by the affiliate as collateral for a loan derivatives transactions and securities lending transactions where the bank has credit exposure to an affiliate and the issuance of a guarantee acceptance or letter of credit on behalf of an affiliate all covered transactions including certain additional transactions such as transactions with a third party in which an affiliate has a financial interest must be conducted on market terms the frb enforces these restrictions and we are audited for compliance 

section 23b prohibits an institution from engaging in certain transactions with affiliates unless the transactions are on terms substantially the same or at least as favorable to the bank as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with nonaffiliated companies transactions between a bank and any of its subsidiaries that are engaged in certain financial activities may be subject to the affiliated transaction limits the frb also may designate banking subsidiaries as affiliates 

pursuant to frb regulation o we are also subject to quantitative restrictions on extensions of credit to executive officers directors principal stockholders and their related interests in general such extensions of credit may not exceed certain dollar limitations must be made on substantially the same terms including interest rates and collateral as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with third parties and must not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features certain extensions of credit also require the approval of our board 



volcker rule 

the doddfrank act prohibits banks and their affiliates from engaging in proprietary trading and investing in sponsoring and having certain relationships with private funds such as certain hedge funds or private equity funds the statutory provision is commonly called the “volcker rule” in october 2019 the frb occ fdic the sec and the cftc collectively the “volcker agencies” finalized amendments to their regulations to tailor the volcker rule’s compliance requirements to the amount of a firm’s trading activity revise the definition of trading account clarify certain key provisions in the volcker rule and modify the information companies are required to provide the volcker agencies under those amendments we expect that we would be regarded as having “moderate” trading assets and liabilities and therefore subject to a requirement to have a simplified compliance program that is appropriate for our activities size scope and complexity in june 2020 the volcker agencies finalized other regulations modifying the volcker rule’s prohibition on banking entities investing in or sponsoring hedge funds or private equity funds referred to under the rule as covered funds this final rule became effective october 1 2020 we do not expect either of these regulatory amendments to the volcker rule to have a material impact on citizens 

consumer financial protection regulations 

the retail activities of banks are subject to a variety of statutes and regulations designed to protect consumers and promote lending to various sectors of the economy and population these laws include but are not limited to the equal credit opportunity act the fair debt collection practices act the fair credit reporting act the truth in lending act the home mortgage disclosure act the service members civil relief act the expedited funds availability act the right to financial privacy act the truth in savings act the electronic funds transfer act and their respective federal regulations and state law counterparts 

in addition to these federal laws and regulations the guidance and interpretations of the various federal agencies charged with the responsibility of implementing such regulations also influences loan and deposit operations 

the cfpb has broad rulemaking supervisory examination and enforcement authority over various consumer financial protection laws including the laws referenced above fair lending laws and certain other statutes the cfpb also has examination and primary enforcement authority with respect to depository institutions with 10 billion or more in assets including the authority to prevent unfair deceptive or abusive acts or practices in connection with the offering of consumer financial products 

the doddfrank act permits states to adopt stricter consumer protection laws and standards that are more stringent than those adopted at the federal level and in certain circumstances allows state attorneys general to enforce compliance with both the state and federal laws and regulations state regulation of financial products and potential enforcement actions could also adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

protection of customer personal information and cybersecurity 

the privacy provisions of glba generally prohibit financial institutions including us from disclosing nonpublic personal financial information of consumer customers to third parties for certain purposes primarily marketing unless customers have the opportunity to opt out of the disclosure the fair credit reporting act restricts information sharing among affiliates for marketing purposes both the fair credit reporting act and regulation v issued by the frb govern the use and provision of information to consumer reporting agencies 

the federal banking regulators regularly issue guidance regarding cybersecurity intended to enhance cyber risk management standards among financial institutions financial institutions are expected to design multiple layers of security controls to establish lines of defense and to ensure that their risk management processes also address the risk posed by compromised customer credentials including security measures to reliably authenticate customers’ accessing internetbased services of the financial institution further a financial institution’s management is expected to maintain sufficient business continuity planning processes to ensure the rapid recovery resumption and maintenance of the institution’s operations after a cyberattack involving destructive malware a financial institution is also expected to develop appropriate processes to enable recovery of data and business operations and address rebuilding network capabilities and restoring data if the institution or its critical service providers fall victim to this type of cyberattack if we fail to observe the regulatory guidance we could be subject to various regulatory sanctions including financial penalties for a further discussion of risks related to cybersecurity see item 1a “risk factors” 



in november 2021 the federal regulators issued a final rule mandating financial institutions to report certain significant cybersecurity incidents to regulators the final rule requires a financial institution to notify its primary banking regulator within 36 hours of certain significant cybersecurity incidents which has or is reasonably likely to disrupt or degrade its i ability to carry out banking operations activities or processes or deliver banking products and services to a material portion of its customer base ii business lines including associated operations services functions and support that upon failure would result in a material loss of revenue profit or franchise value or iii operations including associated services functions and support the failure or discontinuance of which would pose a threat to the financial stability of the united states bank service providers are required to notify at least one designated point of contact at affected banking organization customers as soon as possible after any computersecurity incident which has or is reasonably likely to materially disrupt or degrade covered services for four or more hours the final rule is effective april 1 2022 with a compliance date of may 1 2022 

state regulators have also been increasingly active in implementing privacy and cybersecurity standards and regulations recently several states have adopted laws and regulations requiring certain financial institutions to implement cybersecurity programs and providing detailed requirements with respect to these programs including data encryption requirements for example the california consumer privacy act which became effective on january 1 2020 gives new rights to california residents to require certain businesses to disclose or delete their personal information in addition many states have also recently implemented or modified their data breach notification and data privacy requirements we expect this trend of statelevel activity to continue and are continually monitoring developments in the states in which we operate 

community reinvestment act 

the cra requires banking regulators to evaluate the parent company and cbna in meeting the credit needs of our local communities including providing credit to individuals residing in low and moderate income neighborhoods the cra also requires each appropriate federal bank regulatory agency in connection with its examination of a depository institution to assess such institution’s record in assessing and meeting the credit needs of the community served by that institution and assign ratings the regulatory agency’s evaluation of the institution’s record and ratings are made public these cra performance evaluations are also considered by regulatory agencies in evaluating mergers acquisitions and applications to open a branch or facility and in the case of a bank holding company that has elected financial holding company status a cra rating of at least “satisfactory” is required to commence certain new financial activities or to acquire a company engaged in such activities cbna received a rating of “outstanding” in our most recent cra evaluation 

on december 14 2021 the occ adopted a final cra rule that is based largely on the 1995 cra rules as revised that were issued by the occ frb and fdic this final rule became effective january 1 2022 and applies to national banks and savings associations the adoption of this final rule also rescinded the cra final rule published by the occ on june 5 2020 and facilitates the occs planned future issuance of updated interagency cra rules with the frb and fdic we will continue to evaluate the impact of any changes to the regulations implementing the cra 

compensation 

our compensation practices are subject to oversight by the frb and the occ the federal banking regulators have issued guidance designed to ensure that incentive compensation arrangements at banking organizations take into account risk and are consistent with safe and sound practices the guidance sets forth the following three key principles with respect to incentive compensation arrangements 

i the arrangements should provide employees with incentives that appropriately balance risk and financial results in a manner that does not encourage employees to expose their organizations to imprudent risk 

ii the arrangements should be compatible with effective controls and risk management and 

iii the arrangements should be supported by strong corporate governance 

the guidance provides that supervisory findings with respect to incentive compensation will be incorporated as appropriate into the organization’s supervisory ratings 

the us financial regulators including the frb the occ and the sec jointly proposed regulations in 2011 and again in 2016 to implement the incentive compensation requirements of section 956 of the doddfrank act these regulations have not been finalized 



antimoney laundering 

the bank secrecy act and the usa patriot act contain antimoney laundering and financial transparency provisions intended to detect and prevent the use of the us financial system for money laundering and terrorist financing activities these laws and their implementing regulations require us financial institutions like us including our bank and brokerdealer subsidiaries to maintain an antimoney laundering program verify the identity of customers verify the identity of certain beneficial owners for legal entity customers monitor for and report suspicious transactions report on cash transactions exceeding specified thresholds and respond to requests for information by regulatory authorities and law enforcement agencies in addition we are prohibited from entering into specified financial transactions and account relationships and are required to meet enhanced standards for due diligence in dealings with foreign financial institutions and foreign customers we also must take reasonable steps to conduct enhanced scrutiny of account relationships to guard against money laundering and to report any suspicious transactions financial services regulators are focusing their examinations on antimoney laundering compliance and we continue to monitor and augment where necessary our antimoney laundering compliance programs the federal banking agencies are required when reviewing bank and bank holding company acquisition or merger applications to take into account the effectiveness of the antimoney laundering activities of the applicants 

the antimoney laundering act of 2020 enacted on january 1 2021 as part of the national defense authorization act does not directly impose new requirements on financial institutions but requires the us treasury department to issue national antimoney laundering and countering the financing of terrorism priorities and conduct studies and issue regulations that may over the next few years significantly alter some of the due diligence recordkeeping and reporting requirements that the bank secrecy act and usa patriot act impose on financial institutions the antimoney laundering act of 2020 also increases penalties for violations of the bank secrecy act and significantly expands a whistleblower award program both of which could increase the prospect of regulatory enforcement 

office of foreign assets control regulation 

the us has imposed economic sanctions that affect transactions with designated foreign countries nationals and others these are typically known as the “ofac” rules based on their administration by the us treasury department office of foreign assets control the ofacadministered sanctions targeting countries take many different forms generally they contain one or more of the following elements 

i restrictions on trade with or investment in a sanctioned country including prohibitions against direct or indirect imports from and exports to a sanctioned country and prohibitions on us persons engaging in financial transactions relating to making investments in or providing investmentrelated advice or assistance to a sanctioned country and 

ii a blocking of assets in which the government or specially designated nationals of the sanctioned country have an interest by prohibiting transfers of property subject to us jurisdiction including property in the possession or control of us persons blocked assets eg property and bank deposits cannot be paid out withdrawn set off or transferred in any manner without a license from ofac 

ofac publishes and routinely updates lists of names of persons and organizations suspected of aiding harboring or engaging in terrorist acts including the specially designated nationals and blocked persons we are responsible for among other things blocking accounts of and transactions with such targets and countries prohibiting unlicensed trade and financial transactions with them and reporting blocked transactions after their occurrence if we find a name on any transaction account or wire transfer that is on an ofac list we must freeze such account file a suspicious activity report and notify the appropriate authorities failure to comply with these sanctions could have serious legal and reputational consequences 

regulation of brokerdealers 

our subsidiaries ccmi jmp securities llc and citizens securities inc are registered brokerdealers with the sec and subject to regulation and examination by the sec as well as finra and other selfregulatory organizations these regulations cover a broad range of issues including capital requirements sales and trading practices use of client funds and securities the conduct of directors officers and employees recordkeeping and recording supervisory procedures to prevent improper trading on material nonpublic information qualification and licensing of sales personnel and limitations on the extension of credit in securities transactions in addition to federal registration state securities commissions require the registration of certain brokerdealers 



heightened risk governance standards 

cbna is subject to occ guidelines imposing heightened risk governance standards on large national banks with average total consolidated assets of 50 billion or more the guidelines set forth minimum standards for the design and implementation of a bank’s risk governance framework and minimum standards for oversight of that framework by a bank’s board of directors the guidelines are intended to protect the safety and soundness of covered banks and improve bank examiners’ ability to assess compliance with the occ’s expectations under the guidelines a bank may use its parent company’s risk governance framework if the framework meets the minimum standards the risk profiles of the parent company and the covered bank are substantially the same and certain other conditions are met cbna has elected to use the parent company’s risk governance framework a bank’s board of directors is required to have two members who are independent of the bank and parent company management a bank’s board of directors is responsible for ensuring that the risk governance framework meets the standards in the guidelines providing active oversight and a credible challenge to management’s recommendations and decisions and ensuring that the parent company decisions do not jeopardize the safety and soundness of the bank 

  intellectual property 

in the highly competitive banking industry in which we operate trademarks service marks trade names and logos are important to the success of our business we own and license a variety of trademarks service marks trade names logos and pending registrations and are spending significant resources to develop our standalone brands 

website access to citizens’ filings with the sec 

we maintain a website at investorcitizensbankcom we make available on our website free of charge our annual reports on form 10k quarterly reports on form 10q and current reports on form 8k including exhibits and amendments to those reports that are filed or furnished to the sec pursuant to section 13a of the securities exchange act of 1934 these documents are made available on our website as soon as reasonably practicable after they are electronically filed with or furnished to the sec the sec also maintains an internet site wwwsecgov that contains reports proxy and information statements and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the sec 




 item 1a risk factors 

we are subject to a number of risks potentially impacting our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows as we are a financial services organization certain elements of risk are inherent in our transactions and operations and are present in the business decisions we make we therefore encounter risk as part of the normal course of our business and we design risk management processes to help manage these risks our success is dependent on our ability to identify understand and manage the risks presented by our business activities so that we can appropriately balance revenue generation and profitability these risks include but are not limited to credit risk market risk liquidity risk operational risk model risk technology regulatory and legal risk and strategic and reputational risk we discuss our principal risk management processes and in appropriate places related historical performance in the “risk governance” section in item 7 

you should carefully consider the following risk factors that may affect our business financial condition and results of operations other factors that could affect our business financial condition and results of operation are discussed in the “forwardlooking statements” section above however there may be additional risks that are not presently material or known and factors besides those discussed below or in this or other reports that we file or furnish with the sec that could also adversely affect us 

risks related to our business 

the covid19 pandemic has adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect us and created and may exacerbate or create new significant risks and uncertainties for our business and the ultimate impact of the pandemic on us will depend on future developments which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted 

the covid19 pandemic has negatively affected the global and us economies increased unemployment levels disrupted supply chains and businesses in many industries lowered equity market valuations decreased liquidity in fixed income markets and created significant volatility and disruption in financial markets this has resulted and could continue to result in higher and more volatile provisions for credit losses and is also 



expected to result in increased chargeoffs particularly as more customers experience credit deterioration and as customers need to draw on their committed credit lines to help finance their businesses and activities the pandemic’s negative economic impact and its effect on customer needs and behaviors could adversely affect our liquidity and capital profile moreover governmental actions in response to the pandemic are meaningfully influencing the interestrate environment which has and is likely to continue to reduce our net interest margin the pandemic may also have adverse effects on our noninterest income including causing volatility in our capital markets fees card and service fees and foreign exchange and interest rate products fees 

in addition our reliance on workfromhome capabilities and the potential inability to maintain critical staff in our operational facilities present risks associated with our local infrastructure illness quarantines and the sustainability of a workfromhome environment as well as heightened cybersecurity information security and operational risks many of our service providers have been and may further be affected by similar factors that increase their risk of business disruptions or that may otherwise affect their ability to perform under the terms of any agreements with us or provide essential services any disruption to our ability to deliver financial products or services to or interact with our clients and customers could result in losses or increased operational costs regulatory fines penalties or other sanctions or harm to our reputation we also face an increased risk of litigation and governmental and regulatory scrutiny as a result of the effects of the pandemic on market and economic conditions and the actions of governmental authorities in response to those conditions 

the extent to which the pandemic adversely affects our business financial condition and results of operations as well as our liquidity and regulatory capital ratios will depend on future developments which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted including the scope and duration of the pandemic the widespread availability use and effectiveness of vaccines the effectiveness of our workfromhome arrangements and staffing levels in operational facilities actions taken by governmental authorities and other third parties in response to the pandemic and the direct and indirect impact of the pandemic on us our clients and customers our service providers and other market participants as the pandemic adversely affects us it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described herein 

we may not be able to successfully execute our business strategy 

our business strategy is designed to maximize the full potential of our business and drive sustainable growth and enhanced profitability and our success rests on our ability to maintain a highperforming customercentric organization develop differentiated value propositions to acquire deepen and retain core customer segments build excellent capabilities designed to help us stand out from our competitors operate with financial discipline and a mindset of continuous improvement to selffund investments prudently grow and optimize our balance sheet modernize our technology and operational models to improve delivery organizational agility and speed to market and embed risk management within our culture and our operations our future success and the value of our stock will depend in part on our ability to effectively implement our business strategy there are risks and uncertainties many of which are not within our control associated with each element of our strategy if we are not able to successfully execute our business strategy we may never achieve our financial performance goals and any shortfall may be material see the “business strategy” section in item 1 for further information 

supervisory requirements and expectations on us as a financial holding company and a bank holding company and any regulatorimposed limits on our activities could adversely affect our ability to implement our strategic plan expand our business continue to improve our financial performance and make capital distributions to our stockholders 

our operations are subject to extensive regulation supervision and examination by the federal banking agencies the frb the occ and the fdic as well as the cfpb as part of the supervisory and examination process if we are unsuccessful in meeting the supervisory requirements and expectations that apply to us regulatory agencies may from time to time take supervisory actions against us that may not be publicly disclosed such actions may include restrictions on our activities or the activities of our subsidiaries informal nonpublic or formal public supervisory actions or public enforcement actions including the payment of civil money penalties which could increase our costs and limit our ability to implement our strategic plans and expand our business and as a result could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations see the “regulation and supervision” section in item 1 for further information 

changes in interest rates may have an adverse effect on our profitability 

net interest income historically has been and we anticipate that it will remain a significant component of our total revenue this is due to the fact that a high percentage of our assets and liabilities have been and will 



likely continue to be in the form of interestbearing or interestrelated instruments changes in interest rates can have a material effect on many areas of our business including net interest income deposit costs loan volume and delinquency and the value of our mortgage servicing rights interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond our control including general economic conditions and policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies and in particular the federal open market committee changes in monetary policy including changes in interest rates could influence not only the interest we receive on loans and securities and the amount of interest we pay on deposits and borrowings but such changes could also affect our ability to originate loans and obtain deposits and the fair value of our financial assets and liabilities if the interest rates on our interestbearing liabilities increase at a faster pace than the interest rates on our interest earning assets our net interest income may decline and with it a decline in our earnings may occur our net interest income and our earnings would be similarly affected if the interest rates on our interest earning assets declined at a faster pace than the interest rates on our interestbearing liabilities 

we cannot control or predict with certainty changes in interest rates global national regional and local economic conditions competitive pressures and the policies of regulatory authorities including monetary policies of the frb affect interest income and interest expense although we have policies and procedures designed to manage the risks associated with changes in market interest rates as further discussed under the “risk governance” section in item 7 changes in interest rates still may have an adverse effect on our profitability 

if our ongoing assumptions regarding borrower or depositor behavior or overall economic conditions are significantly different than we anticipate then our risk mitigation may be insufficient to protect against interest rate risk and our net income would be adversely affected 

changes in the method pursuant to which the libor and other benchmark rates are calculated and their planned discontinuance could adversely impact our business operations and financial results 

many of our lending products securities derivatives and other financial transactions utilize a benchmark rate such as libor to determine the applicable interest rate or payment amount in 2017 the chief executive of the uk financial conduct authority announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of libor after 2021 we continue to monitor market developments and regulatory updates including the announcements from the ice benchmark administration to extend the cessation date for several us dollar libor tenors to june 30 2023 as well as collaborate with regulators and industry groups on the transition 

the discontinuation of a benchmark rate changes in a benchmark rate or changes in market perceptions of the acceptability of a benchmark rate including libor could among other things adversely affect the value of and return on certain of our financial instruments or products result in changes to our risk exposures or require renegotiation of previous transactions in addition any such discontinuation or changes whether actual or anticipated could result in market volatility adverse tax or accounting effects increased compliance legal and operational costs and risks associated with customer disclosures and contract negotiations the transition to using a new rate could also expose us to risks associated with disputes with customers and other market participants in connection with interpreting and implementing libor fallback provisions for more information on our libor transition see the “market risk” section in item 7 

we could fail to attract retain or motivate highly skilled and qualified personnel including our senior management other key employees or members of our board which could impair our ability to successfully execute our strategic plan and otherwise adversely affect our business 

a cornerstone of our strategic plan involves the hiring of highly skilled and qualified personnel accordingly our ability to implement our strategic plan and our future success depends on our ability to attract retain and motivate highly skilled and qualified personnel including our senior management and other key employees and directors the marketplace for skilled personnel is becoming more competitive which means the cost of hiring incentivizing and retaining skilled personnel may continue to increase the failure to attract or retain including as a result of an untimely death or illness of key personnel or replace a sufficient number of appropriately skilled and key personnel could place us at a significant competitive disadvantage and prevent us from successfully implementing our strategy which could impair our ability to implement our strategic plan successfully achieve our performance targets and otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

limitations on the manner in which regulated financial institutions such as us can compensate their officers and employees including those contained in pending rule proposals implementing requirements of 



section 956 of the doddfrank act may make it more difficult for such institutions to compete for talent with financial institutions and other companies not subject to these or similar limitations if we are unable to compete effectively our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected perhaps materially 

our ability to meet our obligations and the cost of funds to do so depend on our ability to access identified sources of liquidity at a reasonable cost 

liquidity risk is the risk that we will not be able to meet our obligations including funding commitments as they come due this risk is inherent in our operations and can be heightened by a number of factors including an overreliance on a particular source of funding including for example secured fhlb advances changes in credit ratings or marketwide phenomena such as market dislocation and major disasters like many banking groups our reliance on customer deposits to meet a considerable portion of our funding has grown over recent years and we continue to seek to increase the proportion of our funding represented by customer deposits however these deposits are subject to fluctuation due to certain factors outside our control such as increasing competitive pressures for retail or corporate customer deposits changes in interest rates and returns on other investment classes or a loss of confidence by customers in us or in the banking sector generally which could result in a significant outflow of deposits within a short period of time to the extent there is heightened competition among us banks for retail customer deposits this competition may increase the cost of procuring new deposits andor retaining existing deposits and otherwise negatively affect our ability to grow our deposit base an inability to grow or any material decrease in our deposits could have a material adverse effect on our ability to satisfy our liquidity needs 

maintaining a diverse and appropriate funding strategy for our assets consistent with our wider strategic risk appetite and plan remains challenging and any tightening of credit markets could have a material adverse impact on us in particular there is a risk that corporate and financial institution counterparties may seek to reduce their credit exposures to banks and other financial institutions for example reductions in unsecured deposits supplied by these counterparties which may cause funding from these sources to no longer be available under these circumstances we may need to seek funds from alternative sources potentially at higher costs than has previously been the case or may be required to consider disposals of other assets not previously identified for disposal in order to reduce our funding commitments 

a reduction in our credit ratings which are based on a number of factors could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

credit ratings affect the cost and other terms upon which we are able to obtain funding rating agencies regularly evaluate us and their ratings are based on a number of factors including our financial strength other factors considered by rating agencies include conditions affecting the financial services industry generally any downgrade in our ratings would likely increase our borrowing costs could limit our access to capital markets and otherwise adversely affect our business for example a ratings downgrade could adversely affect our ability to sell or market certain of our securities including longterm debt engage in certain longerterm derivatives transactions and retain our customers particularly corporate customers who may require a minimum rating threshold in order to place funds with us in addition under the terms of certain of our derivatives contracts we may be required to maintain a minimum credit rating or have to post additional collateral or terminate such contracts any of these results of a rating downgrade could increase our cost of funding reduce our liquidity and have adverse effects on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our financial performance may be adversely affected by deterioration in borrower credit quality particularly in the new england midatlantic and midwest regions where our operations are predominately concentrated 

we have exposure to many different industries and risks arising from actual or perceived changes in credit quality and uncertainty over the recoverability of amounts due from borrowers is inherent in our businesses our exposure may be exacerbated by the geographic concentration of our operations which are predominately located in the new england midatlantic and midwest regions the credit quality of our borrowers may deteriorate for a number of reasons that are outside our control including as a result of prevailing economic and market conditions and asset valuation the trends and risks affecting borrower credit quality particularly in the new england midatlantic and midwest regions have caused and in the future may cause us to experience impairment charges increased repurchase demands higher costs additional writedowns and losses and an inability to engage in routine funding transactions which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 



our framework for managing risks may not be effective in mitigating risk and loss 

our risk management framework is made up of various processes and strategies to manage our risk exposure the framework to manage risk including the framework’s underlying assumptions may not be effective under all conditions and circumstances if the risk management framework proves ineffective we could suffer unexpected losses and could be materially adversely affected 

one of the main types of risks inherent in our business is credit risk an important feature of our credit risk management system is to employ an internal credit risk control system through which we identify measure monitor and mitigate existing and emerging credit risk of our customers as this process involves detailed analyses of the customer or credit risk taking into account both quantitative and qualitative factors it is subject to human error in exercising their judgment our employees may not always be able to assign an accurate credit rating to a customer or credit risk which may result in our exposure to higher credit risks than indicated by our risk rating system 

in addition we have undertaken certain actions to enhance our credit policies and guidelines to address potential risks associated with particular industries or types of customers as discussed in more detail under the “risk governance” and “market risk” sections in item 7 however we may not be able to effectively implement these initiatives or consistently follow and refine our credit risk management system if any of the foregoing were to occur it may result in an increase in the level of nonaccrual loans and a higher risk exposure for us which could have a material adverse effect on us 

changes in our accounting policies or in accounting standards could materially affect how we report our financial results and condition 

from time to time the fasb and sec change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of our financial statements these changes can be operationally complex to implement and can materially impact how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations for example in june 2016 the fasb issued accounting standards update 201613 measurement of credit losses on financial instruments “cecl” that substantially changed the accounting for credit losses on loans and other financial assets held by banks financial institutions and other organizations upon adoption of cecl on january 1 2020 we recognize credit losses on these assets equal to management’s estimate of credit losses over the full remaining expected life we consider all relevant information when estimating expected credit losses including details about past events current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts as evidenced in the first half of 2020 due to the impact of covid19 the standard introduces heightened volatility in provision for credit losses given uncertainty in the accuracy of macroeconomic forecasts over longer time horizons variances in the rate and composition of loan growth and changes in overall loan portfolio size and mix as a result it is possible that our ongoing reported earnings and lending activity could be negatively impacted for more information regarding cecl see note 1 in item 8 

our financial and accounting estimates and risk management framework rely on analytical forecasting and models 

the processes we use to estimate our inherent loan losses and to measure the fair value of financial instruments as well as the processes used to estimate the effects of changing interest rates and other market measures on our financial condition and results of operations depends upon the use of analytical and forecasting models some of our tools and metrics for managing risk are based upon our use of observed historical market behavior we rely on quantitative models to measure risks and to estimate certain financial values models may be used in such processes as determining the pricing of various products grading loans and extending credit measuring interest rate and other market risks predicting losses assessing capital adequacy and calculating regulatory capital levels as well as estimating the value of financial instruments and balance sheet items poorly designed or implemented models present the risk that our business decisions based on information incorporating such models will be adversely affected due to the inadequacy of that information moreover our models may fail to predict future risk exposures if the information used in the model is incorrect obsolete or not sufficiently comparable to actual events as they occur we seek to incorporate appropriate historical data in our models but the range of market values and behaviors reflected in any period of historical data is not at all times predictive of future developments in any particular period and the period of data we incorporate into our models may turn out to be inappropriate for the future period being modeled in such case our ability to manage risk would be limited and our risk exposure and losses could be significantly greater than our models indicated in addition if existing or potential customers believe our risk management is inadequate they could take their business elsewhere this could harm our reputation as well as our revenues and profits finally information we provide to 



our regulators based on poorly designed or implemented models could also be inaccurate or misleading some of the decisions that our regulators make including those related to capital distributions to our stockholders could be adversely affected due to their perception that the quality of the models used to generate the relevant information is insufficient 

the preparation of our financial statements requires the use of estimates that may vary from actual results particularly various factors may cause our allowance for credit losses to increase 

the preparation of audited consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make significant estimates that affect the financial statements our most critical accounting estimate is the acl the acl is a reserve established through a provision for credit losses charged to expense and represents our estimate of expected credit losses within the existing loan and lease portfolio and unfunded lending commitments the level of the acl is based on periodic evaluation of the loan and lease portfolios and unfunded lending commitments that are not unconditionally cancellable considering a number of relevant underlying factors including key assumptions and evaluation of quantitative and qualitative information 

the determination of the appropriate level of the acl inherently involves a degree of subjectivity and requires that we make significant estimates of current credit risks and future trends all of which may undergo material changes changes in economic conditions affecting borrowers the stagnation of certain economic indicators that we are more susceptible to such as unemployment and real estate values new information regarding existing loans identification of additional problem loans and other factors both within and outside our control may require an increase in the acl in addition bank regulatory agencies periodically review our acl and may require an increase in the acl or the recognition of further loan chargeoffs based on judgments that can differ from those of our own management in addition if chargeoffs in future periods exceed the acl—that is if the acl is inadequate—we will need to recognize additional provision for credit losses should such additional provision expense become necessary it would result in a decrease in net income and capital and may have a material adverse effect on us for more information regarding our use of estimates in preparation of financial statements see note 1 in item 8 and the “critical accounting estimates” section in item 7 

operational risks are inherent in our businesses 

our operations depend on our ability to process a very large number of transactions efficiently and accurately while complying with applicable laws and regulations operational risk and losses can result from internal and external fraud improper conduct or errors by employees or third parties failure to document transactions properly or to obtain proper authorization failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements and conduct of business rules equipment failures including those caused by natural disasters or by electrical telecommunications or other essential utility outages business continuity and data security system failures including those caused by computer viruses cyberattacks against us or our vendors or unforeseen problems encountered while implementing major new computer systems or upgrades to existing systems or the inadequacy or failure of systems and controls including those of our suppliers or counterparties although we have implemented risk controls and loss mitigation actions and substantial resources are devoted to developing efficient procedures identifying and rectifying weaknesses in existing procedures and training staff it is not possible to be certain that such actions have been or will be effective in controlling each of the operational risks faced by us any weakness in these systems or controls or any breaches or alleged breaches of such laws or regulations could result in increased regulatory supervision enforcement actions and other disciplinary action and have an adverse impact on our business applicable authorizations and licenses reputation and results of operations 

the financial services industry including the banking sector is undergoing rapid technological change as a result of changes in customer behavior competition and changes in the legal and regulatory framework and we may not be able to compete effectively as a result of these changes 

the financial services industry including the banking sector is continually undergoing rapid technological change with frequent introductions of new technologydriven products and services in addition new unexpected technological changes could have a disruptive effect on the way banks offer products and services we believe our success depends to a great extent on our ability to address customer needs by using technology to offer products and services that provide convenience to customers and to create additional efficiencies in our operations however we may not be able to among other things keep up with the rapid pace of technological changes effectively implement new technologydriven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to our customers as a result our ability to compete effectively to attract 



or retain new business may be impaired and our business financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected 

in addition changes in the legal and regulatory framework under which we operate require us to update our information systems to ensure compliance our need to review and evaluate the impact of ongoing rule proposals final rules and implementation guidance from regulators further complicates the development and implementation of new information systems for our business also recent regulatory guidance has focused on the need for financial institutions to perform increased due diligence and ongoing monitoring of thirdparty vendor relationships thus increasing the scope of management involvement and decreasing the efficiency otherwise resulting from our relationships with thirdparty technology providers given the significant number of ongoing regulatory reform initiatives it is possible that we incur higher than expected information technology costs in order to comply with current and impending regulations see “—supervisory requirements and expectations on us as a financial holding company and a bank holding company and any regulatorimposed limits on our activities could adversely affect our ability to implement our strategic plan expand our business continue to improve our financial performance and make capital distributions to our stockholders” 

we are subject to a variety of cybersecurity risks that if realized could adversely affect how we conduct our business 

information security risks for large financial institutions such as us have increased significantly in recent years in part because of the proliferation of new technologies such as internet and mobile banking to conduct financial transactions and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime hackers terrorists nationstates activists and other external parties third parties with whom we or our customers do business also present operational and information security risks to us including security breaches or failures of their own systems the possibility of employee error failure to follow security procedures or malfeasance also presents these risks particularly given the recent trend towards remote work arrangements our operations rely on the secure processing transmission and storage of confidential information in our computer systems and networks as well as in the thirdparty computer systems and networks used to provide products and services on our behalf in addition to access our products and services our customers may use personal computers smartphones tablets and other mobile devices that are beyond our control environment although we believe that we have appropriate information security procedures and controls based on our adherence to applicable laws and regulations industry standards and best practices our technologies systems networks and our customers’ devices may be the target of cyberattacks or information security breaches that could result in the unauthorized release gathering monitoring misuse theft sale or loss or destruction of the confidential andor proprietary information of cfg our customers our vendors our counterparties or our employees we are under continuous threat of loss or network degradation due to cyberattacks such as computer viruses malicious or destructive code phishing attacks ransomware and distributed denial of service “ddos” attacks this is especially true as we continue to expand customer capabilities to utilize the internet and other remote channels to transact business two of the most significant cyberattack risks that we face are efraud and loss of sensitive customer data loss from efraud occurs when cybercriminals extract funds directly from customers’ or our accounts using fraudulent schemes that may include internetbased funds transfers we have been subject to a number of efraud incidents historically we have also been subject to attempts to steal sensitive customer data such as account numbers and social security numbers through unauthorized access to our computer systems including computer hacking such attacks are less frequent but could present significant reputational legal and regulatory costs to us if successful we have implemented certain technology protections such as customer profiling and setup authentication to be in compliance with the ffiec authentication and access to financial institution services and systems guidelines 

as cyber threats continue to evolve we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our layers of defense or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities system enhancements and updates may also create risks associated with implementing new systems and integrating them with existing ones due to the complexity and interconnectedness of information technology systems the process of enhancing our layers of defense can itself create a risk of systems disruptions and security issues in addition addressing certain information security vulnerabilities such as hardwarebased vulnerabilities may affect the performance of our information technology systems the ability of our hardware and software providers to deliver patches and updates to mitigate vulnerabilities in a timely manner can introduce additional risks particularly when a vulnerability is being actively exploited by threat actors cyberattacks against the patches themselves have also proven to be a significant risk that companies will have to address going forward 



despite our efforts to prevent a cyberattack a successful cyberattack could persist for an extended period of time before being detected and following detection it could take considerable time for us to obtain full and reliable information about the cybersecurity incident and the extent amount and type of information compromised during the course of an investigation we may not necessarily know the full effects of the incident or how to remediate it and actions and decisions that are taken or made in an effort to mitigate risk may further increase the costs and other negative consequences of the incident 

the techniques used by cyber criminals change frequently may not be recognized until launched and can be initiated from a variety of sources including terrorist organizations and hostile foreign governments these actors may attempt to fraudulently induce employees customers or other users of our systems to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to data or our systems in the event that a cyberattack is successful our business financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected for a discussion of the guidance that federal banking regulators have released regarding cybersecurity and cyber risk management standards see the “regulation and supervision” section of item 1 

we rely heavily on communications and information systems to conduct our business 

we rely heavily on communications and information systems to conduct our business any failure interruption or breach in security of these systems including due to hacking or other similar attempts to breach information technology security protocols could result in failures or disruptions in our customer relationship management general ledger deposit loan and other systems although we have established policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the effect of the possible failure interruption or security breach of our information systems there can be no assurance that these policies and procedures will be successful and that any such failure interruption or security breach will not occur or if they do occur that they will be adequately addressed the occurrence of any failure interruption or security breach of our information systems could require us to devote substantial resources including management time and attention to recovery and response efforts damage our reputation result in a loss of customer business subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny or expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability although we maintain insurance coverage for information security events we may incur losses as a result of such events that are not insured against or not fully covered by our insurance 

we rely on third parties for the performance of a significant portion of our information technology 

we rely on third parties for the performance of a significant portion of our information technology functions and the provision of information technology and business process services for example i unaffiliated third parties operate data communications networks on which certain components and services relating to our online banking system rely ii third parties host or maintain many of our applications including a commercial loan system which is hosted and maintained by automated financial systems inc and our mobile digital banking application which is hosted and maintained by amazon web services inc iii fidelity information services llc maintains our core deposits system iv infosys limited provides us with a wide range of information technology support services including service desk end user support production application support and private cloud support and v kyndryl inc provides us with mainframe support services the success of our business depends in part on the continuing ability of these and other third parties to perform these functions and services in a timely and satisfactory manner which performance could be disrupted or otherwise adversely affected due to failures or other information security events originating at the third parties or at the third parties’ suppliers or vendors socalled “fourth party risk” we may not be able to effectively monitor or mitigate fourthparty risk in particular as it relates to the use of common suppliers or vendors by the third parties that perform functions and services for us if we experience a disruption in the provision of any functions or services performed by third parties we may have difficulty in finding alternate providers on terms favorable to us and in reasonable time frames if these services are not performed in a satisfactory manner we would not be able to serve our customers well in either situation our business could incur significant costs and be adversely affected 

we are exposed to reputational risk and the risk of damage to our brands and the brands of our affiliates 

our success and results depend in part on our reputation and the strength of our brands we are vulnerable to adverse market perception as we operate in an industry where integrity customer trust and confidence are paramount we are exposed to the risk that litigation employee misconduct operational failures the outcome of regulatory or other investigations or actions press speculation and negative publicity perception of our environmental social and governance practices and disclosures among other factors could damage our 



brands or reputation our brands and reputation could also be harmed if we sell products or services that do not perform as expected or customers’ expectations for the product are not satisfied 

we may be adversely affected by unpredictable catastrophic events or terrorist attacks and our business continuity and disaster recovery plans may not adequately protect us from serious disaster 

the occurrence of catastrophic events such as hurricanes tropical storms tornadoes and other largescale catastrophes and terrorist attacks could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations if a catastrophe rendered both our production data center in rhode island and our recovery data center in north carolina unusable although we maintain both business continuity and disaster recovery plans there can be no assurance that these plans and related capabilities will adequately protect us from serious disaster 

risks related to our industry 

any deterioration in national economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our business is affected by national economic conditions as well as perceptions of those conditions and future economic prospects changes in such economic conditions are not predictable and cannot be controlled adverse economic conditions such as challenges in the global supply chain and recent inflationary trends could require us to charge off a higher percentage of loans and increase the provision for credit losses which would reduce our net income and otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we operate in an industry that is highly competitive which could result in losing business or margin declines and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we operate in a highly competitive industry the industry could become even more competitive as a result of reform of the financial services industry resulting from the doddfrank act and other legislative regulatory and technological changes as well as continued consolidation we face aggressive competition from other domestic and foreign lending institutions and from numerous other providers of financial services including nonbanking financial institutions that are not subject to the same regulatory restrictions as banks and bank holding companies securities firms and insurance companies and competitors that may have greater financial resources 

with respect to nonbanking financial institutions technology and other changes have lowered barriers to entry and made it possible for nonbanks to offer products and services traditionally provided by banks for example consumers can maintain funds that would have historically been held as bank deposits in brokerage accounts or mutual funds consumers can also complete transactions such as paying bills andor transferring funds directly without the assistance of banks the process of eliminating banks as intermediaries known as “disintermediation” could result in the loss of fee income as well as the loss of customer deposits and the related income generated from those deposits some of our nonbank competitors are not subject to the same extensive regulations we are and therefore may have greater flexibility in competing for business as a result of these and other sources of competition we could lose business to competitors or be forced to price products and services on less advantageous terms to retain or attract clients either of which would adversely affect our profitability 

the conditions of other financial institutions or of the financial services industry could adversely affect our operations and financial conditions 

financial services institutions are typically interconnected as a result of trading investment liquidity management clearing counterparty and other relationships within the financial services industry the default by any one institution could lead to defaults by other institutions concerns about or a default by one institution could lead to significant liquidity problems and losses or defaults by other institutions as the commercial and financial soundness of many financial institutions are closely related as a result of these credit trading clearing and other relationships even the perceived lack of creditworthiness of or questions about a counterparty may lead to marketwide liquidity problems and losses or defaults by various institutions this systemic risk may adversely affect financial intermediaries such as clearing agencies banks and exchanges with which we interact on a daily basis or key funding providers such as the fhlbs any of which could have a material adverse effect on our access to liquidity or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 



risks related to regulations governing our industry 

as a financial holding company and a bank holding company we are subject to comprehensive regulation that could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

as a financial holding company and a bank holding company we are subject to comprehensive regulation supervision and examination by the frb in addition cbna is subject to comprehensive regulation supervision and examination by the occ our regulators supervise us through regular examinations and other means that allow the regulators to gauge management’s ability to identify assess and control risk in all areas of operations in a safe and sound manner and to ensure compliance with laws and regulations in the course of their supervision and examinations our regulators may require improvements in various areas if we are unable to implement and maintain any required actions in a timely and effective manner we could become subject to informal nonpublic or formal public supervisory actions and public enforcement orders that could lead to significant restrictions on our existing business or on our ability to engage in any new business such forms of supervisory action could include without limitation written agreements cease and desist orders and consent orders and may among other things result in restrictions on our ability to pay dividends requirements to increase capital restrictions on our activities the imposition of civil monetary penalties and enforcement of such actions through injunctions or restraining orders we could also be required to dispose of certain assets and liabilities within a prescribed period the terms of any such supervisory or enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are a bank holding company that has elected to become a financial holding company pursuant to the bank holding company act financial holding companies are allowed to engage in certain financial activities in which a bank holding company is not otherwise permitted to engage however to maintain financial holding company status a bank holding company and all of its depository institution subsidiaries must be “well capitalized” and “well managed” if a bank holding company ceases to meet these capital and management requirements there are many penalties it would be faced with including the frb may impose limitations or conditions on the conduct of its activities and it may not undertake any of the broader financial activities permissible for financial holding companies or acquire a company engaged in such financial activities without prior approval of the frb if a company does not return to compliance within 180 days which period may be extended the frb may require divestiture of that company’s depository institutions to the extent we do not meet the requirements to be a financial holding company in the future there could be a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we may be unable to disclose some restrictions or limitations on our operations imposed by our regulators 

from time to time bank regulatory agencies take supervisory actions that restrict or limit a financial institution’s activities and lead it to raise capital or subject it to other requirements directives issued to enforce such actions may be confidential and thus in some instances we are not permitted to publicly disclose these actions in addition as part of our regular examination process our regulators may advise us to operate under various restrictions as a prudential matter any such actions or restrictions if and in whatever manner imposed could adversely affect our costs and revenues moreover efforts to comply with any such nonpublic supervisory actions or restrictions may require material investments in additional resources and systems as well as a significant commitment of managerial time and attention as a result such supervisory actions or restrictions if and in whatever manner imposed could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations and in certain instances we may not be able to publicly disclose these matters 

the regulatory environment in which we operate continues to be subject to significant and evolving regulatory requirements that could have a material adverse effect on our business and earnings 

we are heavily regulated by multiple banking consumer protection securities and other regulatory authorities at the federal and state levels this regulatory oversight is primarily established to protect depositors the fdic’s deposit insurance fund consumers of financial products and the financial system as a whole not our security holders changes to statutes regulations rules or policies including the interpretation implementation or enforcement of statutes regulations rules or policies could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways including by for example subjecting us to additional costs limiting the types of financial services and other products we may offer limiting our ability to pursue acquisitions and increasing the ability of third parties including nonbanks to offer competing financial services and products in recent years we together with the rest of the financial services industry have faced particularly intense scrutiny with many new regulatory initiatives and vigorous oversight and enforcement on the part of numerous regulatory and 



governmental authorities legislatures and regulators have pursued a broad array of initiatives intended to promote the safety and soundness of financial institutions financial market stability the transparency and liquidity of financial markets and consumer and investor protection certain regulators and law enforcement authorities have also recently required admissions of wrongdoing and in some cases criminal pleas as part of the resolutions of matters brought by them against financial institutions any such resolution of a matter involving us could lead to increased exposure to civil litigation could adversely affect our reputation could result in penalties or limitations on our ability to do business or engage in certain activities and could have other negative effects in addition a single event or issue may give rise to numerous and overlapping investigations and proceedings including by multiple federal and state regulators and other governmental authorities 

we are also subject to laws and regulations relating to the privacy of the information of our customers employees counterparties and others and any failure to comply with these laws and regulations could expose us to liability andor reputational damage as new privacyrelated laws and regulations are implemented the time and resources needed for us to comply with those laws and regulations as well as our potential liability for noncompliance and our reporting obligations in the case of data breaches may significantly increase 

while there have been significant revisions to the laws and regulations applicable to us that have been finalized in recent months there are other rules to implement changes that have yet to be proposed or enacted by our regulators the final timing scope and impact of these changes to the regulatory framework applicable to financial institutions remains uncertain for more information on regulations to which we are subject and recent initiatives to reform financial institution regulation see the “regulation and supervision” section in item 1 

we are subject to capital adequacy and liquidity standards and if we fail to meet these standards our financial condition and operations would be adversely affected 

we are subject to several capital adequacy and liquidity standards to the extent that we are unable to meet these standards our ability to make distributions of capital will be limited and we may be subject to additional supervisory actions and limitations on our activities see “regulation and supervision” in item 1 and the “capital and regulatory requirements” and “liquidity” sections in item 7 for further discussion of the regulations to which we are subject 

the parent company could be required to act as a “source of strength” to cbna which would have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

frb policy historically required bank holding companies to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to their subsidiary banks the doddfrank act codified this policy as a statutory requirement this support may be required by the frb at times when we might otherwise determine not to provide it or when doing so is not otherwise in the interests of cfg or our stockholders or creditors and may include one or more of the following 

• the parent company may be compelled to contribute capital to cbna including by engaging in a public offering to raise such capital furthermore any extensions of credit from the parent company to cbna that are included in cbna’s capital would be subordinate in right of payment to depositors and certain other indebtedness of cbna 

• in the event of a bank holding company’s bankruptcy any commitment that the bank holding company had been required to make to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to priority of payment 

• in the event of impairment of the capital stock of cbna the parent company as cbna’s stockholder could be required to pay such deficiency 



the parent company depends on cbna for substantially all of its revenue and restrictions on dividends and other distributions by cbna could affect its liquidity and ability to fulfill our obligations 

as a bank holding company the parent company is a separate and distinct legal entity from cbna our banking subsidiary the parent company typically receives substantially all of our revenue from dividends from cbna these dividends are the principal source of funds to pay dividends on our equity and interest and principal on our debt various federal andor state laws and regulations as well as regulatory expectations limit the amount of dividends that cbna may pay to the parent company also our right to participate in a distribution of assets upon a subsidiary’s liquidation or reorganization is subject to the prior claims of the subsidiary’s creditors in the event cbna is unable to pay dividends to the parent company it may not be able to service debt pay obligations or pay dividends on its common stock the inability to receive dividends from cbna could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations see the “supervision and regulation” section in item 1 and the “capital and regulatory matters” section in item 7 

from timetotime we may become or are subject to regulatory actions that may have a material impact on our business 

we may become or are involved from time to time in reviews investigations and proceedings both formal and informal by governmental and selfregulatory agencies regarding our business these regulatory actions involve among other matters accounting compliance and operational matters certain of which may result in adverse judgments settlements fines penalties injunctions or other relief that may require changes to our business or otherwise materially impact our business 

in regulatory actions such as those referred to above it is inherently difficult to determine whether any loss is probable or whether it is possible to reasonably estimate the amount of any loss we cannot predict with certainty if how or when such proceedings will be resolved or what the eventual fine penalty or other relief conditions or restrictions if any may be particularly for actions that are in their early stages of investigation the parent company may be required to make significant restitution payments to cbna customers arising from certain compliance issues and also may be required to pay civil money penalties in connection with certain of these issues this uncertainty makes it difficult to estimate probable losses which in turn can lead to substantial disparities between the reserves we may establish for such proceedings and the eventual settlements fines or penalties adverse regulatory actions could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are and may be subject to litigation that may have a material impact on our business 

our operations are diverse and complex and we operate in legal and regulatory environments that expose us to potentially significant litigation risk in the normal course of business we have been named from time to time as a defendant in various legal actions including arbitrations class actions and other litigation arising in connection with our activities as a financial services institution including with respect to alleged unfair or deceptive business practices and misselling of certain products certain of the actual or threatened legal actions include claims for substantial compensatory andor punitive damages or claims for indeterminate amounts of damages in some cases the entities that would otherwise be the primary defendants in such cases are bankrupt or in financial distress moreover a number of recent judicial decisions have upheld the right of borrowers to sue lending institutions on the basis of various evolving legal theories collectively termed “lender liability” generally lender liability is founded on the premise that a lender has either violated a duty whether implied or contractual of good faith and fair dealing owed to the borrower or has assumed a degree of control over the borrower resulting in the creation of a fiduciary duty owed to the borrower or its other creditors or stockholders this could increase the amount of private litigation to which we are subject for more information regarding ongoing significant legal proceedings in which we may be involved see note 19 in item 8 

compliance with antimoney laundering and antiterrorism financing rules involves significant cost and effort 

we are subject to rules and regulations regarding money laundering and the financing of terrorism monitoring compliance with antimoney laundering and antiterrorism financing rules can put a significant financial burden on banks and other financial institutions and poses significant technical challenges although we believe our current policies and procedures are sufficient to comply with applicable rules and regulations we cannot guarantee that our antimoney laundering and antiterrorism financing policies and procedures completely prevent situations of money laundering or terrorism financing any such failure events may have severe 



consequences including sanctions fines and reputational consequences which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

risks related to our common stock 

our stock price may be volatile and you could lose all or part of your investment as a result 

you should consider an investment in our common stock to be risky and you should invest in our common stock only if you can withstand a significant loss and wide fluctuation in the market value of your investment the market price of our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to among other things the factors described in this “risk factors” section and other factors some of which are beyond our control these factors include 

• quarterly variations in our results of operations or the quarterly financial results of companies perceived to be similar to us 

• changes in expectations as to our future financial performance including financial estimates by securities analysts and investors 

• our announcements or our competitors’ announcements regarding new products or services enhancements significant contracts acquisitions or strategic investments 

• fluctuations in the market valuations of companies perceived by investors to be comparable to us 

• future sales of our common stock 

• additions or departures of members of our senior management or other key personnel 

• changes in industry conditions or perceptions and 

• changes in applicable laws rules or regulations and other dynamics 

furthermore the stock markets have experienced price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market price of equity securities of many companies these fluctuations have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies these broad market fluctuations as well as general economic systemic political and market conditions such as recessions loss of investor confidence interest rate changes or international currency fluctuations may negatively affect the market price of our common stock 

if any of the foregoing occurs it could cause our stock price to fall and may expose us to securities class action litigation that even if unsuccessful could be costly to defend and a distraction to management 

we may not repurchase shares or pay cash dividends on our common stock 

holders of our common stock are only entitled to receive such dividends as our board of directors may declare out of funds legally available for such payments although we have historically declared cash dividends on our common stock we are not required to do so and may reduce or eliminate our common stock dividend in the future this could adversely affect the market price of our common stock also as a bank holding company our ability to repurchase shares and declare and pay dividends is dependent on certain federal regulatory considerations including the rules of the frb regarding capital adequacy and dividends additionally we are required to submit periodic capital plans to the frb for review or otherwise obtain frb authorization before we can take certain capital actions including repurchasing shares declaring and paying dividends or repurchasing or redeeming capital securities if our capital plan or any amendment to our capital plan is objected to for any reason our ability to repurchase shares and declare and pay dividends on our capital stock may be limited further if we are unable to satisfy the capital requirements applicable to us for any reason we may be limited in our ability to repurchase shares and declare and pay dividends on our capital stock see the “regulation and supervision” section in item 1 for further discussion of the regulations to which we are subject 

“antitakeover” provisions and the regulations to which we are subject may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us even if the change in control would be beneficial to stockholders 

we are a bank holding company incorporated in the state of delaware antitakeover provisions in delaware law and our restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws as well as regulatory approvals that would be required under federal law could make it more difficult for a third party to take control of us and may prevent stockholders from receiving a premium for their shares of our common stock these provisions could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and could reduce the amount that stockholders might get if we are sold 



furthermore banking laws impose notice approval and ongoing regulatory requirements on any stockholder or other party that seeks to acquire direct or indirect “control” of an fdicinsured depository institution these laws include the bank holding company act and the change in bank control act 

risks related to our pending and recently completed acquisitions 

failure to complete our proposed acquisition of investors could negatively impact our business financial results and stock price 

if for any reason the acquisition of investors is not completed our ongoing business may be adversely impacted and we will be subject to a number of risks including the financial markets may react negatively resulting in negative impacts on our stock price and other adverse impacts; we may experience negative reactions from our customers vendors and employees we will have incurred substantial expenses and will be required to pay certain costs relating to the acquisition whether or not the acquisition is completed such as legal accounting investment banking and other professional and administrative fees; and matters relating to the acquisition may require substantial commitments of time and resources by our management which could otherwise have been devoted to other opportunities that may have benefited us 

our ability to complete the proposed acquisition of investors is subject to the receipt of approval from various regulatory agencies 

prior to the transactions contemplated in the investors acquisition agreement being consummated the company and investors must obtain certain regulatory approvals including approvals of the federal reserve and the occ the terms and conditions of the approvals that are granted may impose conditions limitations obligations or costs or place restrictions on the conduct of the company or its business following the acquisition or require changes to the terms of the transactions contemplated by the investors acquisition agreement there can be no assurance that the regulators will not impose any such conditions obligations or restrictions and that such conditions limitations obligations or restrictions will not have the effect of delaying or preventing completion of any of the transactions contemplated by the investors acquisition agreement imposing additional material costs on or materially limiting the revenues of the company following the acquisition or otherwise reduce the anticipated benefits of the acquisition if the acquisition were consummated successfully within the expected timeframe any of which might have an adverse effect on the company following the acquisition 

we face risks and uncertainties related to our proposed acquisition of investors and recently closed hsbc branch acquisition 

uncertainty about the effect of the proposed acquisition of investors and recently closed hsbc branch acquisition on personnel and customers may have an adverse effect on us these uncertainties may impair our ability to attract retain and motivate key personnel until the acquisitions are consummated and fully integrated and for a period of time thereafter and could cause customers and others that deal with us to seek to change their existing business relationships with us employee retention may be particularly challenging during the pendency and integration of the acquisitions as employees may experience uncertainty about their roles with the company following the acquisitions the investors branches to be acquired by the company have operated and until the completion of the acquisition will continue to operate independently the ultimate success of the investors and hsbc branch acquisitions including anticipated benefits and cost savings among other things will depend in part on our ability to successfully combine and integrate our and investors’ businesses and hsbc’s branches in a manner that facilitates growth opportunities and realizes anticipated cost savings it is possible that the integration process could result in the loss of key employees the loss of customers the disruption of the companies ongoing business unexpected integration issues higher than expected integration costs and an integration process that takes longer than originally anticipated also if the company experiences difficulties or delays with the integration process the anticipated benefits of the acquisitions may not be realized fully or at all 

the definitive agreement between the company and investors may be terminated in accordance with its terms 

the investors acquisition agreement is subject to a number of conditions which need to be fulfilled in order to consummate the proposed acquisition these conditions include among other things the receipt of all required regulatory approvals the absence of any order injunction or other legal restraint subject to certain exceptions the accuracy of representations and warranties under the investors acquisition agreement our and investors’ performance of our and their respective obligations under the investors acquisition agreement in all material aspects and each of our and investors’ receipt of a tax opinion to the effect that the acquisition will be 



treated as a reorganization within the meaning of section 368a of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended 

the conditions to the closing of the investors acquisition may not be fulfilled in a timely manner or at all and accordingly the acquisition may be delayed or may not be completed we and investors may opt to terminate the investors acquisition agreement under certain circumstances among other situations if the acquisition is not completed by july 28 2022 either we or investors may choose not to proceed with the acquisition provided that such date may be extended to october 28 2022 by us or investors if all other condition precedents other than receipt of all requisite regulatory approvals have been satisfied or waived we and investors can also mutually decide to terminate the investors acquisition agreement at any time 

shareholder litigation could prevent or delay the closing of the proposed acquisition of investors or otherwise negatively impact our business and operations 

lawsuits may be filed against us investors or the directors and officers of either company relating to the proposed acquisition litigation filed against us our board of directors or investors and its board of directors could prevent or delay the completion of the acquisition cause us to incur additional costs or result in the payment of damages following completion of the acquisition the defense or settlement of any lawsuit or claim that remains unresolved at the effective time of the acquisition may adversely affect the combined companys business financial condition results of operation cash flows and market price

nongaap financial measures 

this document contains nongaap financial measures denoted as “underlying” “excluding ppp loans” as well as other results excluding the impact of certain items underlying results for any given reporting period exclude certain items that may occur in that period which management does not consider indicative of our ongoing financial performance we believe these nongaap financial measures provide useful information to investors because they are used by management to evaluate our operating performance and make daytoday operating decisions in addition we believe our underlying results or results excluding the impact of certain items in any given reporting period reflect our ongoing financial performance and increase comparability of periodtoperiod results and accordingly are useful to consider in addition to our gaap financial results 

other companies may use similarly titled nongaap financial measures that are calculated differently from the way we calculate such measures accordingly our nongaap financial measures may not be comparable to similar measures used by such companies we caution investors not to place undue reliance on such nongaap financial measures but to consider them with the most directly comparable gaap measures nongaap financial measures have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for our results reported under gaap 

nongaap measures are denoted throughout our mda by the use of the term underlying or identified as excluding the impact of certain items where there is a reference to these metrics in that paragraph all measures that follow are on the same basis when applicable for more information on the computation of nongaap financial measures see “—nongaap financial measures and reconciliations”

results of operations — 2021 compared with 2020 

net interest income 

net interest income is our largest source of revenue and is the difference between the interest earned on interestearning assets generally loans leases and investment securities and the interest expense incurred in connection with interestbearing liabilities generally deposits and borrowed funds the level of net interest income is primarily a function of the difference between the effective yield on our average interestearning assets and the effective cost of our interestbearing liabilities these factors are influenced by the pricing and mix of interestearning assets and interestbearing liabilities which in turn are impacted by external factors such as local economic conditions competition for loans and deposits the monetary policy of the frb and market interest rates for further discussion refer to “—market risk — nontrading risk” and “—risk governance” 





1 net interest income and net interest margin is presented on fte basis using the federal statutory tax rate of 21 the fte impact is predominantly attributable to commercial and industrial loans for the periods presented 

net interest income of 45 billion decreased 74 million reflecting a 17 basis point decrease in net interest margin given the lower rate and challenging yield curve environment partially offset by 5 average interestearning asset growth improvements in funding mix and deposit pricing and a higher benefit from ppp loan forgiveness 

net interest margin on a fte basis of 272 decreased 17 basis points compared to 289 in 2020 primarily reflecting the impact of lower interest rates and elevated cash balances given strong deposit flows partially offset by improved funding mix and deposit pricing and the benefit of ppp forgiveness average interestearning asset yields of 290 decreased 45 basis points from 335 in 2020 while average interestbearing liability costs of 030 decreased 39 basis points from 069 in 2020 



average interestearning assets of 1665 billion increased 72 billion or 5 from 2020 primarily driven by an 80 billion increase in total investment securities and interestbearing cash and due from banks and deposits in banks and a 23 billion increase in average retail loans partially offset by a 33 billion decrease in average commercial loans retail loan growth was driven by education residential mortgage and automobile partially offset by other retail and home equity commercial decreases were driven by commercial and industrial loans and leases 

average deposits of 1505 billion increased 117 billion from 2020 as a result of elevated liquidity tied to government stimulus associated with the covid19 disruption growth in demand deposits money market accounts savings and checking with interest were partially offset by a decrease in term deposits total interestbearing deposit costs of 160 million decreased 349 million or 69 from 509 million in 2020 primarily due to the lower rate environment and strong pricing discipline 

average total borrowed funds of 75 billion decreased 37 billion from 2020 reflecting the pay down of senior debt and shortterm borrowings given strong customer deposit inflows total borrowed funds costs of 179 million decreased 83 million from 2020 total borrowed funds cost of 238 increased 5 basis points from 233 in 2020 



1 volume and rate changes have been allocated on a consistent basis using the respective percentage changes in average balances and average rates 



noninterest income 



1 includes bankowned life insurance income and other income for all periods presented 

noninterest income of 21 billion decreased 184 million or 8 from 2020 reflecting lower mortgage banking fees partially offset by improved capital markets fees trust and investment services fees letter of credit and loan fees card fees and service charge and fees 

• capital markets fees increased driven by loan syndication underwriting and mergers and acquisitions advisory fees notably to record levels in the fourth quarter of 2021 

• trust and investment services fees increased driven by an increase in assets under management from higher equity market levels and strong inflows 

• letter of credit and loan fees increased reflecting higher commitment fees 

• card fees and service charges and fees increased largely tied to economic recovery 

• mortgage banking fees decreased reflecting increased industry capacity and heightened competition resulting in lower gainonsale margins 

noninterest expense 



noninterest expense of 41 billion increased 90 million or 2 compared to 2020 r eflecting higher equipment and software given continued investment in technology and outside services tied to growth initiatives 

provision for credit losses 

the provision for credit losses is the result of a detailed analysis performed to estimate our acl the total provision for credit losses includes the provision for loan and lease losses and the provision for unfunded commitments refer to “—analysis of financial condition — allowance for credit losses and nonaccrual loans and leases” for more information 



the credit provision benefit of 411 million reflects strong credit performance and an improving macroeconomic outlook net chargeoffs of 325 million decreased 368 million from 2020 driven by decreases in commercial and retail of 261 million and 107 million respectively the decrease in commercial reflected the economic recovery following the onset of the covid19 pandemic and associated lockdowns whereas the decrease in retail was due to us government stimulus programs and strong collateral values in residential real estate and automobile the combination of the credit provision benefit and net chargeoffs resulted in a reduction in our acl of 736 million in 2021 

income tax expense 

income tax expense of 658 million increased 417 million from 241 million in 2020 the 2021 effective tax rate of 221 increased from 185 in 2020 driven by the decreased benefit of taxadvantaged investments on higher pretax income an underlying effective tax rate of 222 in 2021 compared to 199 in 2020 

business operating segments 

we have two business operating segments consumer banking and commercial banking segment results are derived by specifically attributing managed assets liabilities capital and related revenues provision for credit losses which at the segment level is equal to net chargeoffs and other expenses the residual difference between the consolidated provision for credit losses and the business operating segments’ net chargeoffs is reflected in other 

nonsegment operations includes assets liabilities capital revenues provision for credit losses expenses and income tax expense not attributed to our consumer or commercial banking segments as well as treasury and community development in addition other includes goodwill not directly allocated to a business operating segment and any associated goodwill impairment charges for impairment testing purposes we allocate all goodwill to our consumer banking and commercial banking reporting units 

our capital levels are evaluated and managed centrally however capital is allocated on a riskadjusted basis to the business operating segments to support evaluation of business performance because funding and asset liability management is a central function funds transferpricing “ftp” methodologies are utilized to allocate a cost of funds used or credit for the funds provided to all business operating segment assets liabilities and capital respectively using a matchedfunding concept the residual effect on net interest income of assetliability management including the residual net interest income related to the ftp process is included in other we periodically evaluate and refine our methodologies used to measure financial performance of our business operating segments 

noninterest income and expense are directly attributed to each business operating segment including fees service charges salaries and benefits and other direct revenues and costs and are respectively accounted for in a manner similar to our consolidated financial statements occupancy costs are allocated based on utilization of facilities by each business operating segment noninterest expenses incurred by centrally managed operations or business operating segments that directly support another business operating segment’s operations are charged to the applicable business operating segment based on its utilization of those services 

income tax expense is assessed to each business operating segment at a standard tax rate with the residual tax expense or benefit to arrive at the consolidated effective tax rate included in other 

developing and applying methodologies used to allocate items among the business operating segments is a dynamic process accordingly financial results may be revised periodically as management systems are enhanced methods of evaluating performance or product lines are updated or our organizational structure changes 



the following table presents certain financial data of our business operating segments total business operating segment financial results differ from total consolidated net income these differences are reflected in other nonsegment operations see note 26 in item 8 for further information 



1 includes lhfs 

2 the majority of ppp loans are reflected in consumer banking in accordance with how they are managed 

consumer banking 

net interest income increased 251 million or 8 from 2020 driven by the benefit of a 29 billion increase in average loans led by residential mortgages automobile and education as well as the impact of the ppp loan program additionally higher deposit volumes were offset by improved funding mix and deposit pricing noninterest income decreased 432 million or 26 from 2020 driven by a decrease in mortgage banking fees attributable to increased industry capacity and heightened competition resulting in lower gainonsale margins partially offset by higher card fees driven by higher debit and credit card volumes given the economic recovery and trust and investment services fees reflecting an increase in assets under management from higher equity market levels and strong net inflows noninterest expense increased 23 million or 1 from 2020 reflecting higher outside services tied to growth initiatives net chargeoffs of 185 million decreased 103 million or 36 driven by the impact of us government stimulus programs and forbearance as well as strong collateral values in residential real estate and automobile 

commercial banking 

net interest income of 17 billion increased 63 million or 4 from 2020 as the 32 billion decrease in average loans was offset by improved funding mix and deposit pricing on higher deposit volumes noninterest income of 809 million increased 214 million or 36 from 595 million in 2020 driven by a record increase in capital markets fees reflecting higher mergers and acquisitions advisory and loan syndication fees noninterest expense of 973 million increased 113 million  from 860 million in 2020  driven by higher salaries and employee benefits reflecting revenuebased compensation  net chargeoffs of 156 million decreased 242 million from 2020 reflecting improving economic conditions following the onset of the covid19 pandemic and associated lockdowns

analysis of financial condition 

securities 



our securities portfolio is managed to maintain prudent levels of liquidity credit quality and market risk while achieving returns that align with our overall portfolio management strategy the portfolio primarily includes high quality highly liquid investments reflecting our ongoing commitment to maintain strong contingent liquidity levels and pledging capacity us governmentguaranteed notes and gseissued mortgagebacked securities represent 92 of the fair value of our debt securities portfolio holdings at december 31 2021 holdings backed by mortgages dominate our portfolio and facilitate our ability to pledge those securities to the fhlb for collateral purposes 

the fair value of the afs debt securities portfolio of 261 billion at december 31 2021 increased 31 billion from 229 billion at december 31 2020 including 39 billion in portfolio growth offset by a 736 million reduction in unrealized gains driven by a steepening yield curve the fair value of the htm debt securities portfolio decreased 11 billion largely reflecting portfolio runoff 

as of december 31 2021 the portfolio’s average effective duration was 43 years compared with 27 years as of december 31 2020 as higher longterm rates drove a decrease in both actual and projected securities prepayment speeds we manage our securities portfolio duration and convexity risk through asset selection and securities structure and maintain duration levels within our risk appetite in the context of the broader interest rate risk framework and limits 





1 actual maturities may differ from contractual maturities because issuers may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without incurring penalties 

2 the weightedaverage yield is computed based on a constant effective interest rate over the contractual life of each security and considers the contractual 

coupon amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts yields exclude the impact of related hedging derivatives 

loans and leases 



1 includes ppp loans fully guaranteed by the sba of 787 million and 42 billion at december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively 

total loans and leases increased 51 billion or 4 from 1231 billion as of december 31 2020 reflecting a 55 billion increase in retail driven by growth in mortgage and automobile and a 443 million decrease in commercial as underlying growth was more than offset by a 34 billion decrease in ppp loans 





1 includes 163 billion of floatingrate commercial loans hedged to fixed rate to manage our exposure to the variability in interest cash flows 



allowance for credit losses and nonaccrual loans and leases 

the acl is created through charges to the provision for credit losses in order to provide appropriate reserves to absorb estimated future credit losses in accordance with gaap for additional information regarding the acl see “—critical accounting estimates — allowance for credit losses” and note 6 in item 8 

the acl of 19 billion as of december 31 2021 compared with the acl of 27 billion as of december 31 2020 reflecting a reserve release of 736 million for further information see note 6

3 excluding the impact of ppp loans the acl coverage ratio would have been 152 and 224 for december 31 2021 and december 31 2020 respectively for more information on the computation of nongaap financial measures see “—introduction — nongaap financial measures” and “—nongaap financial measures and reconciliations” 





1 loans fully or partially guaranteed by the fha va or usda are classified as accruing 

nonaccrual loans and leases of 702 million as of december 31 2021 decreased 317 million from december 31 2020 reflecting a 42 million decrease in retail and a 275 million decrease in commercial as of december 31 2021 total commercial nonaccrual loans and leases were 03 of the commercial portfolio and decreased from 08 at december 31 2020 commercial nonaccrual loans and leases decreased through loan sale activity repayments and chargeoffs 



ncos of 325 million decreased 368 million or 53 from 693 million in 2020 driven by decreases in commercial and retail of 261 million and 107 million respectively for the year ended december 31 2021 annualized ncos as a percentage of total average loans and leases of 026 decreased 30 basis points compared to 056 in 2020 

the decline in retail ncos is primarily due to us government stimulus programs and forbearance as well as strong collateral values in residential real estate and automobile the decrease in commercial ncos reflects the economic recovery following the onset of the covid19 pandemic and associated lockdowns we continue to assess risks to the recovery including potential for continuing impacts from covid19 variants challenges in the global supply chain and recent inflationary trends as well as potential impacts from ending monetary and fiscal stimulus programs we have maintained a variety of measures to identify and monitor areas of potential risk including direct outreach to commercial clients and close monitoring of retail credit metrics 

commercial loan asset quality 

our commercial portfolio consists of traditional commercial and industrial loans commercial leases and commercial real estate loans the portfolio is predominantly focused on customers in our footprint and adjacent 



states in which we have a physical presence where our local delivery model provides for strong client connectivity additionally we also do business in certain specialized industry sectors on a national basis 

for commercial we utilize regulatory classification ratings to monitor credit quality for more information on regulatory classification ratings see note 6 in item 8 the recorded investment in commercial based on regulatory classification ratings is presented below

commercial and industrial criticized balances of 22 billion or 50 of the total commercial and industrial loan portfolio as of december 31 2021 decreased from 33 billion or 75 as of december 31 2020 the decrease was primarily driven by repayments and net chargeoffs commercial and industrial criticized loans represented 69 of total criticized loans as of december 31 2021 compared to 71 as of december 31 2020 

commercial real estate criticized balances of 945 million or 66 of the commercial real estate portfolio as of december 31 2021 decreased from 13 billion or 88 as of december 31 2020 the decrease was due to repayments and the migration to pass for a few borrowers commercial real estate accounted for 29 of total criticized loans as of december 31 2021 compared to 28 as of december 31 2020

2 deferred fees and costs are reported in all other 

3 excludes ppp loans of 787 million and 42 billion as of december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively 

retail loan asset quality 

for retail loans we utilize credit scores provided by fico which are generally refreshed on a quarterly basis and the loan’s payment and delinquency status to monitor credit quality management believes fico credit scores are considered the strongest indicator of credit losses over the contractual life of the loan as the scores are based on current and historical national industrywide consumer level credit performance data and assist management in predicting the borrower’s future payment performance the largest portion of the retail portfolio is represented by borrowers located in the new england midatlantic and midwest regions although we have continued to lend selectively in areas outside the footprint primarily in auto finance and education lending 





1 90 days past due and accruing includes 544 million and 21 million of loans fully or partially guaranteed by the fha va and usda at december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively

1 the real estate secured portfolio cltv is calculated as the mortgage and second lien loan balance divided by the most recently available value of the property 

troubled debt restructurings 

tdr is the classification given to a loan that has been restructured in a manner that grants a concession to a borrower experiencing financial hardship that we would not otherwise make tdrs typically result from our loss mitigation efforts and are undertaken in order to improve the likelihood of recovery and continuity of the relationship our loan modifications are handled on a casebycase basis and are negotiated to achieve mutually agreeable terms that maximize loan collectability and meet our borrower’s financial needs the types of concessions include interest rate reductions term extensions principal forgiveness and other modifications to the structure of the loan that fall outside our lending policy depending on the specific facts and circumstances of the customer restructuring can involve loans moving to nonaccrual remaining on nonaccrual or remaining on accrual status 

in the first quarter of 2020 we adopted the cares act and interagency guidance issued by the bank regulatory agencies which provide that covid19related modifications to retail and commercial loans that met certain eligibility criteria are exempt from classification as a tdr we generally do not consider payment deferrals and forbearance plans established due to the covid19 pandemic and under the cares act to be tdrs relief provisions granted under the cares act including the tdr classification exemption for certain eligible loans expired on december 31 2021 and therefore any subsequent covid19related loan modifications will likely be classified as tdrs 

tdrs generally return to accrual status once repayment capacity and appropriate payment history can be established tdrs are individually evaluated for impairment and loans once classified as tdrs remain classified as tdrs until paid off sold or refinanced at market terms for additional information regarding tdrs see note 6 in item 8

under the frb’s tailoring rules category iv firms such as us are subject to biennial supervisory stress testing and are exempt from companyrun stress testing and related disclosure requirements the frb supervises category iv firms on an ongoing basis including evaluation of the capital adequacy and capital planning processes during offcycle years annually the frb requires us to submit a capital plan approved by our board of directors or one of its committees on april 2 2021 we submitted our 2021 capital plan to the frb under the frb’s 2021 ccar process for more information see the “tailoring of prudential requirements” section in item 1 

under the frb’s capital plan rule a firm must update and resubmit its capital plan prior to the next annual submission date under certain circumstances which includes a material change in the firm’s risk profile financial condition or corporate structure since its last capital plan submission on july 28 2021 we announced an agreement to acquire investors requiring us to resubmit our capital plan to the frb we submitted our updated capital plan on september 15 2021 

under the stress capital buffer “scb” framework the frb will not object to capital plans on quantitative grounds and each firm is required to maintain capital ratios above the sum of its minimum and scb requirements to avoid restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments 

effective april 5 2021 the frb adopted a final rule to make conforming changes to its capital plan rule and stress capital buffer and capital planning requirements to be consistent with the tailoring rules framework under the final rule for category iv firms like us the scb will be recalibrated with each biennial supervisory stress test and updated annually to reflect our planned common stock dividends in addition category iv firms may elect to participate in the supervisory stress test and receive an updated scb requirement in a year in which they are not subject to the supervisory stress test we did not elect to participate in the 2021 supervisory stress test and on august 5 2021 the frb announced that our scb will remain unchanged at 34 from october 1 2021 through september 30 2022 

in light of the heightened uncertainty related to the covid19 pandemic and associated lockdowns the frb took certain actions to preserve capital at banks beginning in the third quarter of 2020 through the second quarter of 2021 beginning july 1 2021 the frb lifted all temporary restrictions on capital distributions and authorized firms like us that are on a twoyear cycle and not subject to supervisory stress testing in 2021 to make capital distributions that are consistent with the regulatory capital rules including normal restrictions under the frb stress capital buffer framework in addition we temporarily suspended share repurchases in connection with entering into the agreement to acquire investors we resumed share repurchases after the investors shareholder vote on november 19 2021 in january 2021 our board of directors authorized us to repurchase up to 750 million of our common stock of which 455 million is available as of december 31 2021 all future capital distributions are subject to consideration and approval by our board of directors prior to execution the timing and amount of future dividends and share repurchases will depend on various factors including our capital position financial performance riskweighted assets capital impacts of strategic initiatives market conditions and regulatory considerations 

regulations relating to capital planning regulatory reporting stress testing and capital buffer requirements applicable to firms like us are presently subject to rulemaking and potential further guidance and interpretation by the applicable federal regulators we will continue to evaluate the impact of these and any other prudential regulatory changes including their potential resultant changes in our regulatory and compliance costs and expenses

capital framework 

under the current us basel iii capital framework we and our banking subsidiary cbna must meet the following specific minimum requirements cet1 capital ratio of 45 tier 1 capital ratio of 60 total capital ratio of 80 and tier 1 leverage ratio of 40 as a bank holding company our scb of 34 is imposed on top of the three minimum riskbased capital ratios listed above and a ccb of 25 is imposed on top of the three minimum riskbased capital ratios listed above for our banking subsidiary 

under the us basel iii rules the cet1 deduction threshold for msrs certain deferred tax assets and investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions is 25 as of december 31 2021 we did not meet the threshold for these additional capital deductions msrs or certain deferred tax assets not deducted from cet1 capital are assigned a 250 risk weight and investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions not deducted from cet1 capital are assigned an exposure category risk weight 

in reaction to the covid19 pandemic the frb and the other federal banking regulators adopted a final rule relative to regulatory capital treatment of acl under cecl this rule allowed electing banking organizations to delay the estimated impact of cecl on regulatory capital for a twoyear period ending january 1 2022 followed by a threeyear transition period ending january 1 2025 to phasein the aggregate amount of the capital benefit provided during the initial twoyear delay as of december 31 2021 the aggregate capital benefit provided during the initial twoyear delay was 384 million 



1 required “minimum capital ratio” for 2021 and 2020 are common equity tier 1 capital of 45 tier 1 capital of 60 total capital of 80 and tier 1 leverage of 40 

2 “minimum capital ratios” include a stress capital buffer of 34 na to tier 1 leverage 

at december 31 2021 our cet1 capital tier 1 capital and total capital ratios were 99 111 and 127 respectively as compared with 100 113 and 134 respectively as of december 31 2020 the cet1 capital ratio decreased as 121 billion of riskweighted asset “rwa” growth and the impact of dividends and common share repurchases as described in “—capital transactions” below a decrease in the modified cecl transitional amount and increases in goodwill and intangibles as a result of acquisitions were mostly offset by net income for the year ended december 31 2021 the tier 1 capital ratio decreased due to the changes in cet1 capital described above and the redemption of series a preferred stock offset by the issuance of series g preferred stock described in “—capital transactions” below the total capital ratio decreased due to the changes in cet1 and tier 1 capital described above combined with the net change in aacl and a decrease in qualifying subordinated debt resulting from haircut provisions partially offset by the subordinated debt exchange offer in the first quarter of 2021 as described in “—capital transactions” below at december 31 2021 our cet1 capital tier 1 capital and total capital ratios were approximately 200 basis points 170 basis points and 130 basis points respectively above their regulatory minimums plus our scb all ratios remained well above the us basel iii minimums 

regulatory capital ratios and capital composition 

cet1 capital under us basel iii standardized rules totaled 157 billion at december 31 2021 an increase from 146 billion at december 31 2020 driven by net income for the year ended december 31 2021 



offset by dividends common share repurchases a decrease in the modified cecl transitional amount and increases in goodwill and intangibles as a result of acquisitions tier 1 capital at december 31 2021 totaled 177 billion reflecting a 11 billion increase from 166 billion at december 31 2020 driven by the changes in cet1 capital and the issuance of series g preferred stock partially offset by the redemption of series a preferred stock total capital of 202 billion at december 31 2021 increased 642 million from december 31 2020 driven by the changes in cet1 and tier 1 capital partially offset by the net change in aacl and a decrease in qualifying subordinated debt 

rwa totaled 1588 billion at december 31 2021 based on us basel iii standardized rules up 121 billion from december 31 2020 this increase was driven by higher commercial loans automobile loans commercial commitments bankowned life insurance residential mortgages agency securities msrs education loans and other retail commitments these rwa increases were partially offset by lower derivative valuations and other retail loans 

as of december 31 2021 the tier 1 leverage ratio was 97 up from 94 at december 31 2020 driven by higher tier one capital partially offset by the 64 billion increase in quarterly adjusted average assets 



1 as of december 31 2021 and 2020 the amount of nonqualifying subordinated debt excluded from regulatory capital was 420 million and 348 million respectively 

2 excess allowance represents the amount excluded from tier 2 capital that is in excess of 125 of risk weighted assets excluding market risk 

on february 11 2021 we completed 265 million in private exchange offers for five series of outstanding subordinated notes exchange offer participants received newlyissued fixedrate reset subordinated notes due 2031 which are redeemable by us five years prior to their maturity these subordinated debt exchange offers will benefit our tier 2 and total capital going forward by increasing the amount of subordinated debt eligible for inclusion in tier 2 capital without increasing the aggregate principal amount of subordinated debt outstanding see note 13 for more details on our outstanding subordinated debt 

capital adequacy process 

our assessment of capital adequacy begins with our boardapproved risk appetite and risk management framework this framework provides for the identification measurement and management of material risks capital requirements are determined for actual and forecasted risk portfolios using applicable regulatory capital methodologies the assessment also considers the possible impacts of approved and proposed changes to regulatory capital requirements key analytical frameworks including stress testing which enable the assessment of capital adequacy versus unexpected loss under a variety of stress scenarios supplement our base 



line forecast a governance framework supports our capital planning process including capital management policies and procedures that document capital adequacy metrics and limits as well as our capital contingency plan and the active engagement of both the legalentity boards and senior management in oversight and decisionmaking 

forwardlooking assessments of capital adequacy feed development of a single capital plan covering us and our banking subsidiary that is periodically submitted to the frb we prepare this plan in full compliance with the frb’s capital plan rule and we participate annually in the frb’s horizontal capital review which is the frb’s assessment of specific capital planning areas as part of their normal supervisory process

banking subsidiary’s capital 



cbna’s cet1 and tier 1 capital totaled 170 billion at december 31 2021 up 10 billion from 160 billion at december 31 2020 the increase was primarily driven by net income for the year ended december 31 



2021 partially offset by dividend payments to the parent company and a decrease in the modified cecl transitional amount total capital was 196 billion at december 31 2021 an increase of 620 million from 190 billion at december 31 2020 driven by the change in cet1 capital partially offset by the net change in aacl 

cbna’s rwa totaled 1586 billion at december 31 2021 up 120 billion from december 31 2020 this increase was driven by higher commercial loans automobile loans commercial commitments bankowned life insurance residential mortgages agency securities msrs education loans and other retail commitments these rwa increases were partially offset by lower derivative valuations and other retail loans 

as of december 31 2021 the cbna tier 1 leverage ratio increased to 94 from 92 at december 31 2020 driven by higher tier one capital partially offset by the 63 billion increase in quarterly adjusted average assets 

liquidity 

liquidity is defined as our ability to meet our cashflow and collateral obligations in a timely manner at a reasonable cost an institution must maintain operating liquidity to meet its expected daily and forecasted cashflow requirements as well as contingent liquidity to meet unexpected stress scenario funding requirements reflecting the importance of meeting all unexpected and stressscenario funding requirements we identify and manage contingent liquidity consisting of cash balances at the frb unencumbered highquality liquid securities and unused fhlb borrowing capacity separately we also identify and manage asset liquidity as a subset of contingent liquidity consisting of cash balances at the frb and unencumbered highquality liquid securities we consider the effective and prudent management of liquidity fundamental to our health and strength we manage liquidity at the consolidated enterprise level and at each material legal entity including at the parent company and cbna level 

parent company liquidity 

our parent company’s primary sources of cash are dividends and interest received from cbna as a result of investing in bank equity and subordinated debt as well as externally issued preferred stock senior and subordinated debt uses of cash include the routine cash flow requirements as a bank holding company including periodic share repurchases and payments of dividends interest and expenses the needs of subsidiaries including cbna for additional equity and as required its need for debt financing and the support for extraordinary funding requirements when necessary to the extent the parent company has relied on wholesale borrowings uses also include payments of related principal and interest 

during the year ended december 31 2021 the parent company completed the following transactions 

• redeemed all outstanding shares of 550 fixedtofloating rate noncumulative perpetual series a preferred stock 

• issued 300000 shares of 400 fixedrate reset noncumulative perpetual series g preferred stock at an aggregate offering price of 300 million and 

• redeemed 350 million of 2375 fixedrate senior unsecured debt due july 2021 

for further information on outstanding debt and preferred stock see note 13 and note 17 in item 8 

during the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 the parent company declared dividends on common stock of 670 million and 672 million respectively and declared dividends on preferred stock of 113 million and 107 million respectively in addition the parent company repurchased 295 million and 270 million of its outstanding common stock respectively 

our parent company’s cash and cash equivalents represent a source of liquidity that can be used to meet various needs and totaled 23 billion as of december 31 2021 compared with 27 billion as of december 31 2020 the parent company’s doubleleverage ratio the combined equity investment in parent company subsidiaries divided by parent company equity is a measure of reliance on equity cash flows from subsidiaries to fund parent company obligations at december 31 2021 the parent company’s doubleleverage ratio was 985 

cbna liquidity 

as cbna’s primary business involves taking deposits and making loans a key role of liquidity management is to ensure that customers have timely access to funds from deposits and for loans liquidity management also involves maintaining sufficient liquidity to repay wholesale borrowings pay operating expenses and support extraordinary funding requirements when necessary in the ordinary course of business the liquidity of cbna is 



managed by matching sources and uses of cash the primary sources of bank liquidity include deposits from our consumer and commercial customers payments of principal and interest on loans and debt securities and wholesale borrowings as needed and as described under “—liquidity risk management and governance” the primary uses of bank liquidity include withdrawals and maturities of deposits payment of interest on deposits funding of loans and related commitments and funding of securities purchases to the extent that cbna has relied on wholesale borrowings uses also include payments of related principal and interest for further information on cbna’s outstanding debt see note 13 in item 8 

on january 14 2022 cbna redeemed 10 billion of senior notes due february 2022 

liquidity risk 

we define liquidity risk as the risk that an entity will be unable to meet its payment obligations in a timely manner at a reasonable cost liquidity risk can arise due to contingent liquidity risk andor funding liquidity risk 

contingent liquidity risk is the risk that market conditions may reduce an entity’s ability to liquidate pledge andor finance certain assets and thereby substantially reduce the liquidity value of such assets drivers of contingent liquidity risk include general market disruptions as well as specific issues regarding the credit quality andor valuation of a security or loan issuer or borrower andor asset class 

funding liquidity risk is the risk that market conditions andor entityspecific events may reduce an entity’s ability to raise funds from depositors andor wholesale market counterparties drivers of funding liquidity risk may be idiosyncratic or systemic reflecting impediments to operations andor damaged market confidence 

factors affecting liquidity 

given the composition of assets and borrowing sources contingent liquidity risk at cbna would be materially affected by events such as deterioration of financing markets for highquality securities eg mortgagebacked securities and other instruments issued by the gnma fnma and the fhlmc by any inability of the fhlbs to provide collateralized advances andor by a refusal of the frb to act as a lender of last resort in systemic stress 

similarly given the structure of its balance sheet the funding liquidity risk of cbna would be materially affected by an adverse idiosyncratic event eg a major loss causing a perceived or actual deterioration in its financial condition an adverse systemic event eg default or bankruptcy of a significant capital markets participant or a combination of both consequently and despite ongoing exposure to a variety of idiosyncratic and systemic events we view our contingent liquidity risk and our funding liquidity risk to be relatively modest 

an additional variable affecting our access to unsecured wholesale market funds and to large denomination ie uninsured customer deposits is the credit ratings assigned by such agencies as moody’s standard and poor’s and fitch 

 nr  not rated 

changes in our public credit ratings could affect both the cost and availability of our wholesale funding as a result and in order to maintain a conservative funding profile cbna continues to minimize reliance on 



unsecured wholesale funding at december 31 2021 our wholesale funding consisted primarily of term debt issued by the parent company and cbna 

existing and evolving regulatory liquidity requirements represent another key driver of systemic liquidity conditions and liquidity management practices the frb the occ and the fdic regularly evaluate our liquidity as part of the overall supervisory process in addition we are subject to existing and evolving regulatory liquidity requirements some of which are subject to further rulemaking guidance and interpretation by the applicable federal regulators for further discussion see the “regulation and supervision — tailoring of prudential requirements” and “—liquidity requirements” sections in item 1 

liquidity risk management and governance 

liquidity risk is measured and managed by the funding and liquidity unit within our treasury unit in accordance with policy guidelines promulgated by our board and the asset liability committee in managing liquidity risk the funding and liquidity unit delivers regular and comprehensive reporting including current levels versus threshold limits for a broad set of liquidity metrics and early warning indicators explanatory commentary relating to emerging risk trends and as appropriate recommended remedial strategies 

our funding and liquidity unit’s primary goals are to deliver and maintain prudent levels of operating liquidity to support expected and projected funding requirements contingent liquidity to support unexpected funding requirements resulting from idiosyncratic systemic and combination stress events and regulatory liquidity requirements in a timely manner from stable and costefficient funding sources we seek to accomplish this goal by funding loans with stable deposits by prudently controlling dependence on wholesale funding particularly shortterm unsecured funding and by maintaining ample available liquidity including a contingent liquidity buffer of unencumbered highquality loans and securities as of december 31 2021 

• organically generated deposits continue to be our primary source of funding resulting in a consolidated yearend loanstodeposits ratio excluding lhfs of 830 

• our cash position which is defined as our cash balances at the frb totaled 79 billion 

• our total available liquidity comprised of contingent liquidity and available discount window capacity was approximately 709 billion 

• contingent liquidity was 451 billion consisting of unencumbered highquality liquid securities of 213 billion unused fhlb capacity of 159 billion and our cash balances at the frb of 79 billion asset liquidity a component of contingent liquidity was 292 billion consisting of our cash balances at the frb of 79 billion and unencumbered highquality liquid securities of 213 billion 

• available discount window capacity defined as available total borrowing capacity from the frb based on identified collateral is secured by nonmortgage commercial and retail loans and totaled 258 billion use of this borrowing capacity would be considered only during exigent circumstances and 

• for a summary of our sources and uses of cash by type of activity for the years ended december 31 2021 2020 and 2019 see the consolidated statements of cash flows in item 8 

the funding and liquidity unit monitors a variety of liquidity and funding metrics and early warning indicators and metrics including specific risk thresholds limits these monitoring tools are broadly classified as follows 

• current liquidity sources and capacities including cash balances at the frb free and liquid securities and secured fhlb borrowing capacity 

• liquidity stress sources including idiosyncratic systemic and combined stresses in addition to evolving regulatory requirements and 

• current and prospective exposures including secured and unsecured wholesale funding and spot and cumulative cashflow gaps across a variety of horizons 

further certain of these metrics are monitored individually for cbna and for our consolidated enterprise on a daily basis including cash position unencumbered securities asset liquidity and available fhlb borrowing capacity in order to identify emerging trends and risks and inform funding decisions specific metrics are also forecasted over a oneyear horizon 



contractual obligations 

in the ordinary course of business we enter into contractual obligations that may require future cash payments including customer deposit maturities and withdrawals debt service lease obligations and other cash commitments for more information regarding these obligations see notes 9 12 and 13 in item 8 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we engage in a variety of activities that are not reflected in our consolidated balance sheets that are generally referred to as “offbalance sheet arrangements” for more information on these types of activities see note 19 in item 8 

critical accounting estimates 

our audited consolidated financial statements included in this report are prepared in accordance with gaap the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to establish accounting policies and make estimates that affect amounts reported in our audited consolidated financial statements 

an accounting estimate requires assumptions and judgments about uncertain matters that could have a material effect on our audited consolidated financial statements estimates are made using facts and circumstances known at a point in time changes in those facts and circumstances could produce results substantially different from those estimates our most significant accounting policies and estimates and their related application are discussed below see note 1 in item 8 for further discussion of our significant accounting policies 

allowance for credit losses 

the acl decreased from 27 billion at december 31 2020 to 19 billion at december 31 2021 reflecting a reserve release of 736 million reflecting improvements in our macroeconomic outlook and continued strength in the home price index and used automobile values 

to determine the acl as of december 31 2021 we utilized an economic forecast that generally reflects real gdp growth of approximately 13 over 2022 and projects the unemployment rate to be in the range of 52 to 66 throughout 2022 this forecast reflects an overall improved macroeconomic outlook as compared to december 31 2020 which reflected real gdp growth of approximately 4 over 2021 and unemployment in the range of approximately 7 to 75 throughout 2021 while the us economy has continued to improve with the benefits of vaccination and herd resiliency muting in part the ongoing impact of the covid19 pandemic uncertainty remains we continue to utilize our qualitative allowance framework to reassess and adjust acl reserve levels macroeconomic forecast risk driven by uncertainty around and volatility of key macroeconomic variables is one of the primary factors influencing our qualitative reserve as the economic recovery has continued we have assessed risks to the recovery including potential for continuing impacts from covid19 variants challenges in the global supply chain inflationary trends potential impacts from ending monetary and fiscal stimulus programs and potential for longerterm changes in workforce and consumer behaviors we continued to apply management judgment to adjust the modeled reserves in the commercial industry sectors most impacted by the covid19 pandemic including cre office 

our determination of the acl is sensitive to changes in forecasted macroeconomic conditions during the reasonable and supportable period to illustrate the sensitivity we applied a more pessimistic scenario than that described above which assumes that challenges in acceptance of vaccines and efficacy of vaccines against new strains cause covid19related infections to abate later than in our base case scenario with concerns rising about resistant strains consumer spending is slower to rebound with businesses reopening more slowly and vacation spending muted this pessimistic scenario reflects real gdp growth of approximately 13 and unemployment in the range of 66 to 74 over 2022 excluding consideration of qualitative adjustments this scenario would result in a quantitative lifetime loss estimate of approximately 115x our modeled periodend acl or an increase of approximately 170 million this analysis relates only to the modeled credit loss estimate and not to the overall periodend acl which includes qualitative adjustments 

because several quantitative and qualitative factors are considered in determining the acl this sensitivity analysis does not necessarily reflect the nature and extent of future changes in the acl or even what the acl would be under these economic circumstances the sensitivity is intended to provide insights into the impact of adverse changes in the macroeconomic environment and the corresponding impact to modeled loss estimates the hypothetical determination does not incorporate the impact of management judgment or other 



qualitative factors that could be applied in the actual estimation of the acl and does not imply any expectation of future deterioration in our loss rates 

to provide additional context regarding sensitivity to more pessimistic scenarios our acl balance of 19 billion represents 22 of the 86 billion of ninequarter losses projected in the federal reserve run of the december 2020 supervisory severely adverse scenario which forecasted more protracted unemployment and gdp declines compared with our acl calculation our acl calculation also included the impacts of government stimulus 

comparatively our acl represents 38 of the 51 billion of projected losses in the company run results of the supervisory severely adverse scenario losses projected under the company supervisory severely adverse scenario are lower than the federal reserve results due to methodology and modeling differences as an example the federal reserve’s models did not recognize contractual loss sharing arrangements in the merchant loan portfolio both the company and federal reserve results include incremental losses associated with loan originations assumed postdecember 31 2020 in contrast our december 31 2021 acl balance considers only existing loans and lines of credit as of the reporting date 

while the economic recovery from the covid19 pandemic continues significant future uncertainty still exists including the impacts of covid19 variants and challenges from vaccine acceptance rates and efficacy against newer strains on consumer sentiment and spending behavior it remains difficult to estimate how changes in economic forecasts might affect our acl because such forecasts consider a wide variety of variables and inputs and changes in the variables and inputs may not occur at the same time or in the same direction and such changes may have differing impacts by product types the variables and inputs may be idiosyncratically affected by risks to the recovery including potential for continuing impacts from covid19 variants challenges in the global supply chain and recent inflationary trends as well as potential impacts from ending monetary and fiscal stimulus programs changes in one or multiple of the key variables may have a material impact to our estimation of expected credit losses 

we continue to monitor the impact of covid19 and related fiscal and monetary policy measures on the economy and the resulting potentially material effects on the acl 

for additional information regarding the acl see note 1 and note 6 in item 8 

fair value 

we measure the fair value of assets and liabilities using the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date fair value is also used on a recurring and nonrecurring basis to evaluate certain assets for impairment or for financial statement disclosure purposes examples of nonrecurring uses of fair value include impairment for certain loans leases and goodwill examples of recurring uses of fair value for financial statement disclosure purposes include disclosure of the fair value of certain financial assets and liabilities accounted for on an amortized cost basis such as htm securities for certain assets or liabilities the application of management judgment in the determination of the fair value is more significant due to the lack of observable market data 

msrs do not trade in an active market with readily observable prices msrs are classified as level 3 since the valuation methodology utilizes significant unobservable inputs the fair value is calculated using a discounted cash flow model which uses assumptions including weightedaverage life prepayment assumptions and weightedaverage option adjusted spread it is important to note that changes in our assumptions may not be independent of each other changes in one assumption may result in changes to another eg changes in interest rates which are inversely correlated to changes in prepayment rates may result in changes to discount rates the underlying assumptions and estimated values are corroborated by values received from independent third parties based on their review of the servicing portfolio and comparisons to market transactions 

for additional information regarding our fair value measurements see note 1 note 4 note 9 note 14 and note 20 in item 8 



risk governance 

we are committed to maintaining a strong integrated and proactive approach to the management of all risks to which we are exposed in pursuit of our business objectives a key aspect of our board’s responsibility as the main decision making body is setting our risk appetite to ensure that the levels of risk that we are willing to accept in the attainment of our strategic business and financial objectives are clearly understood 

to enable our board to carry out its objectives it has delegated authority for risk management activities as well as governance and oversight of those activities to a number of board and executive management level risk committees the executive risk committee chaired by the chief risk officer is responsible for oversight of risk across the enterprise and actively considers our inherent material risks analyzes our overall risk profile and seeks confirmation that the risks are being appropriately identified assessed and mitigated reporting to the executive risk committee are the following committees covering specific areas of risk compliance and operational risk committee model risk committee credit policy committee asset liability committee business initiatives review committee and the conduct and ethics committee 

risk framework 

our risk management framework is embedded in our business through a “three lines of defense” model which defines responsibilities and accountabilities for risk management activities 

first line of defense 

the business lines including their associated support functions are the first line of defense and are accountable for identifying assessing managing and controlling the risks associated with the products and services they provide the business lines are responsible for performing regular risk assessments to identify and assess the material risks that arise in their area of responsibility complying with relevant risk policies testing and certifying the adequacy and effectiveness of their operational and financial reporting controls on a regular basis establishing and documenting operating procedures and establishing and owning a governance structure for identifying and managing risk 

second line of defense 

the second line of defense includes independent monitoring and control functions accountable for developing and ensuring implementation of risk and control frameworks and related policies this centralized risk function is appropriately independent from the business and is accountable for overseeing and challenging our business lines on the effective management of their risks including credit market operational regulatory reputational interest rate liquidity and strategic risks 

third line of defense 

our internal audit function is the third line of defense providing independent assurance with a view of the effectiveness of our internal controls governance practices and culture so that risk is managed appropriately for the size complexity and risk profile of the organization internal audit has complete and unrestricted access to any and all of our records physical properties and personnel internal audit issues a report following each internal review and provides an audit opinion to the board’s audit committee on a quarterly basis 

credit review reports to the chief audit executive and provides the legalentity boards senior management and other stakeholders with independent assurance on the quality of credit portfolios and adherence to agreed credit risk appetite and credit policies and processes in line with its procedures and regulatory expectations the credit review function undertakes a program of portfolio testing assessing and reporting through four risk pillars of asset quality rating and data integrity risk management and credit risk appetite 

risk appetite 

risk appetite is a strategic business and risk management tool we define our risk appetite as the maximum limit of acceptable risk beyond which we could be unable to achieve our strategic objectives and capital adequacy obligations 

our principal nonmarket risks include credit operational regulatory reputational liquidity and strategic risks we are also subject to certain market risks which include potential losses arising from changes in interest rates foreign exchange rates equity prices commodity prices andor other relevant market rates or prices market risk in our business arises from trading activities that serve customer needs including hedging of 



interest rates foreign exchange risk and nontrading activities within capital markets we have established enterprisewide policies and methodologies to identify measure monitor and report on market risk we actively manage both trading and nontrading market risks see “—market risk” for further information our risk appetite is reviewed and approved annually by the board risk committee 

credit risk 

overview 

credit risk represents the potential for loss arising from a customer counterparty or issuer failing to perform in accordance with the contractual terms of the obligation while the majority of our credit risk is associated with lending activities we do engage with other financial counterparties for a variety of purposes including investing asset and liability management and trading activities given the financial impact of credit risk on our earnings and balance sheet the assessment approval and management of credit risk represents a major part of our overall riskmanagement responsibility 

objective 

the independent credit risk function is responsible for reviewing and approving credit risk appetite across all lines of business and credit products approving larger and higher risk credit transactions monitoring portfolio performance identifying problem credit exposures and ensuring remedial management 

organizational structure 

management and oversight of credit risk is the responsibility of both the business line and the second line of defense the second line of defense the independent credit risk function is led by the chief credit officer who oversees all of our credit risk the chief credit officer reports to the chief risk officer the chief credit officer acting in a manner consistent with board policies has responsibility for among other things the governance process around policies procedures risk acceptance criteria credit risk appetite limits and authority delegation the chief credit officer and team also have responsibility for credit approvals for larger and higher risk transactions and oversight of line of business credit risk activities reporting to the chief credit officer are the heads of the second line of defense credit functions specializing in consumer banking commercial banking citizens restructuring management portfolio and corporate reporting alll analytics current expected credit loss and credit policy and administration each team under these leaders is composed of highly experienced credit professionals 

governance 

the primary mechanisms used to govern our credit risk function are our consumer and commercial credit policies these policies outline the minimum acceptable lending standards that align with our desired risk appetite material changes in our business model and strategies that identify a need to change our risk appetite or highlight a risk not previously contemplated are identified by the individual committees and presented to the credit policy committee executive risk committee and the board risk committee for approval as appropriate 

key management processes 

we employ a comprehensive and integrated risk control program to proactively identify measure monitor and mitigate existing and emerging credit risks across the credit life cycle origination account managementportfolio management and loss mitigation and recovery 

consumer 

on the consumer banking side of credit risk our teams use models to evaluate consumer loans across the life cycle of the loan starting at origination credit scoring models are used to forecast the probability of default of an applicant when approving customers for a new loan or extension of an existing credit line credit scores are used in conjunction with other credit risk variables such as affordability length of term collateral value collateral type and lien subordination 

to ensure proper oversight of the underwriting teams lending authority is granted by the second line of defense credit risk function to each underwriter the amount of delegated authority depends on the experience of the individual we periodically evaluate the performance of each underwriter and annually reauthorize their delegated authority only senior members of the second line of defense credit risk team are authorized to approve significant exceptions to credit policies it is not uncommon to make exceptions to established policies 



when compensating factors are present there are exception limits which when reached trigger a comprehensive analysis 

once an account is established credit scores and collateral values are refreshed at regular intervals to allow for proactive identification of increasing or decreasing levels of credit risk our approach to managing credit risk is highly analytical and where appropriate is automated to ensure consistency and efficiency 

commercial 

on the commercial banking side of credit risk risk management begins with defined credit products and policies and is separated into ci loans leases and cre within ci loans and leases there are separate verticals established for certain specialty products eg assetbased lending leasing franchise finance health care technology and midcorporate a “specialty vertical” is a standalone team of industry or product specialists substantially all activity that falls under the ambit of the defined industry or product is managed through a specialty vertical when one exists cre also operates as a specialty vertical 

commercial transactions are subject to individual analysis and approval at origination and with few exceptions are subject to a formal annual review requirement the underwriting process includes the establishment and approval of credit grades that confirm the pd and lgd all material transactions then require the approval of both a business line approver and an independent credit approver with the requisite level of delegated authority the approval level of a particular credit facility is determined by the size of the credit relationship as well as the pd the checks and balances in the credit process and the independence of the credit approver function are designed to appropriately assess and sanction the level of credit risk being accepted facilitate the early recognition of credit problems when they occur and to provide for effective problem asset management and resolution all authority to grant credit is delegated through the independent credit risk function and is closely monitored and regularly updated 

the primary factors considered in commercial credit approvals are the financial strength of the borrower assessment of the borrower’s management capabilities cash flows from operations industry sector trends type and sufficiency of collateral type of exposure transaction structure and the general economic outlook while these are the primary factors considered there are a number of other factors that may be considered in the decision process in addition to the credit analysis conducted during the approval process at origination and annual review our credit review group performs testing to provide an independent review and assessment of the quality of the portfolio and new originations this group conducts portfolio reviews on a riskbased cycle to evaluate individual loans and validate risk ratings as well as test the consistency of the credit processes and the effectiveness of credit risk management 

the maximum level of credit exposure to individual credit borrowers is limited by policy guidelines based on the perceived risk of each borrower or related group of borrowers concentration risk is managed through limits on industry asset class and loan quality factors we focus predominantly on extending credit to commercial customers with existing or expandable relationships within our primary markets although we do engage in lending opportunities outside our primary markets if we believe that the associated risks are acceptable and aligned with strategic initiatives 

substantially all loans categorized as classified are managed by a specialized group of credit professionals 

market risk 

market risk refers to potential losses arising from changes in interest rates foreign exchange rates equity prices commodity prices andor other relevant market rates or prices modest market risk arises from trading activities that serve customer needs including hedging of interest rate and foreign exchange risk as described below more material market risk arises from our nontrading banking activities such as loan origination and depositgathering we have established enterprisewide policies and methodologies to identify measure monitor and report market risk we actively manage market risk for both nontrading and trading activities 

nontrading risk 

we are exposed to market risk as a result of nontrading banking activities this market risk is substantially composed of interest rate risk as we have no commodity risk and de minimis direct currency and equity risk we also have market risk related to capital markets loan originations as well as the valuation of our msrs 



interest rate risk 

interest rate risk emerges from the balance sheet after the aggregation of our assets liabilities and equity we refer to this nontrading risk embedded in the balance sheet as “structural interest rate risk” or “interest rate risk in the banking book” 

a major source of structural interest rate risk is a difference in the repricing of assets relative to liabilities and equity there are differences in the timing and drivers of rate changes reflecting the maturity andor repricing of assets and liabilities for example the rate earned on a commercial loan may reprice monthly with changes in libor while the rate paid on debt or certificates of deposit may be fixed for a longer period there may also be differences in the drivers of rate changes loans may be tied to a specific index rate such as libor or prime while deposits may be only loosely correlated with libor and dependent upon competitive demand due to these basis differences net interest income is sensitive to changes in spreads between certain indices or repricing rates 

another important source of structural interest rate risk relates to the potential exercise of explicit or embedded options for example most consumer loans can be prepaid without penalty and most consumer deposits can also be withdrawn without penalty the exercise of such options by customers can exacerbate the timing differences discussed above 

a primary source of our structural interest rate risk relates to faster repricing of floatingrate loans relative to core deposit funding this source of asset sensitivity is more biased toward the short end of the yield curve 

the secondary source of our interest rate risk is driven by longer term rates comprising the rollover or reinvestment risk on fixedrate loans as well as prepayment risk on mortgagerelated loans and securities funded by nonrate sensitive deposits and equity 

the primary goal of interest rate risk management is to control exposure to interest rate risk within policy limits approved by our board these limits and guidelines reflect our tolerance for interest rate risk over both shortterm and longterm horizons to ensure that exposure to interest rate risk is managed within our risk appetite we must measure the exposure and hedge it as necessary the treasury asset and liability management team is responsible for measuring monitoring and reporting on our structural interest rate risk position these exposures are reported on a monthly basis to the asset liability committee and at board meetings 

we measure structural interest rate risk through a variety of metrics intended to quantify both shortterm and longterm exposures the primary method we use to quantify interest rate risk is simulation analysis in which we model net interest income from assets liabilities and hedge derivative positions under various interest rate scenarios over a threeyear horizon exposure to interest rate risk is reflected in the variation of forecasted net interest income across the scenarios 

key assumptions in this simulation analysis relate to the behavior of interest rates and spreads the changes in product balances and the behavior of loan and deposit clients in different rate environments the most material of these behavioral assumptions relate to the repricing characteristics and balance fluctuations of deposits with indeterminate ie noncontractual maturities as well as the pace of mortgage prepayments assessments are periodically made by running sensitivity analyses to determine the impact of key assumptions the results of these analyses are reported to the asset liability committee 

as the future path of interest rates cannot be known in advance we use simulation analysis to project net interest income under various interest rate scenarios including a “most likely” implied forward scenario as well as a variety of deliberately extreme and perhaps unlikely scenarios these scenarios may assume gradual ramping of the overall level of interest rates immediate shocks to the level of rates and various yield curve twists in which movements in short or longterm rates predominate generally projected net interest income in any interest rate scenario is compared to net interest income in a base case where market forward rates are realized 

the table below reports net interest income exposures against a variety of interest rate scenarios our policies involve measuring exposures as a percentage change in net interest income over the next year due to either instantaneous or gradual parallel changes in rates relative to the market implied forward yield curve as the following table illustrates our balance sheet is assetsensitive net interest income would benefit from an increase in interest rates while exposure to a decline in interest rates is within limit while an instantaneous and 



severe shift in interest rates is included in this analysis we believe that any actual shift in interest rates would likely be more gradual and therefore have a more modest impact 

the table below presents the sensitivity of net interest income to various parallel yield curve shifts from the market implied forward yield curve 



we continue to manage asset sensitivity within the scope of our policy and changing market conditions asset sensitivity against a 200 basis point gradual increase in rates was 101 at december 31 2021 compared with 108 at december 31 2020 current levels of asset sensitivity continue to provide meaningful upside benefit to net interest income as we enter a period of expected higher shortterm policy rates from the federal reserve changes in interest rates can also affect the risk positions which impacts the repricing sensitivity or beta of the deposit base as well as the cash flows on assets that allow for early payoff without a penalty the risk position is managed within our risk limits and long term view of interest rates through occasional adjustments to securities investments interest rate swaps and mix of funding 

we use a valuation measure of exposure to structural interest rate risk economic value of equity “eve” as a supplement to net interest income simulations eve complements net interest income simulation analysis as it estimates risk exposure over a longterm horizon eve measures the extent to which the economic value of assets liabilities and offbalance sheet instruments may change in response to fluctuations in interest rates this analysis is highly dependent upon assumptions applied to assets and liabilities with noncontractual maturities the change in value is expressed as a percentage of regulatory capital 

we use interest rate swap contracts to manage the interest rate exposure to variability in the interest cash flows on our floatingrate assets and floatingrate wholesale funding and to hedge market risk on fixedrate capital markets debt issuances 



1 asset liability management “alm” strategies used to manage interest rate exposures include interest rate swap contracts used to manage exposure to the variability in the interest cash flows on our floatingrate commercial loans and floatingrate wholesale funding as well as the variability in the fair value of afs securities 

2 december 31 2020 includes 18 billion of forwardstarting payfixed interest rate swaps that were terminated in the first quarter of 2021 



the following table presents the pretax net gains losses recorded in the consolidated statements of operations and in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income relating to derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges 



1 using the interest rate curve at december 31 2021 with respect to cash flow hedge strategies we estimate that approximately 36 million will be reclassified from aoci to net interest income over the next 12 months 

libor transition 

as previously disclosed many of our lending products securities derivatives and other financial transactions utilize the libor benchmark rate requiring us to develop plans for its discontinuance in late 2018 we formed a libor transition program “the program” designed to guide the organization through the planned discontinuation of libor the program with direction and oversight from our chief financial officer is responsible for developing maintaining and executing against a coordinated strategy to ensure a timely and orderly transition from libor the program is structured to address various initiatives including program governance transition management communications exposure management new alternative reference rate product delivery risk management contract remediation operations and technology readiness accounting and reporting as well as tax and regulation impacts on a quarterly basis we tracked and reviewed the risks associated with the libor transition with a focus on the identification of mitigation actions 

the arrc recommended that banks be systemically and operationally capable of supporting transactions in alternative reference rates such as sofr by the end of september 2020 guided by this milestone we are systemically and operationally prepared to support alternative reference rate transactions on march 5 2021 the fca formally announced the future cessation or loss of representation of the libor benchmark settings currently published by the intercontinental exchange “ice” benchmark administration further the fca stated that the 1week and 2month us dollar libor rates will cease as of december 31 2021 and all other us dollar libor tenors will cease as of june 30 2023 with the frb occ and fdic collectively the agencies supporting this announcement the program adjusted libor transition activities and timelines accordingly the agencies continue to urge market participants to stop entering into new us dollar libor contracts as soon as practicable but no later than the end of 2021 we moved new originations to alternative reference rates over the course of 2021 in anticipation of this deadline however our plans for legacy contract remediation now extend through mid2023 given the fca announcement more broadly program governance remains robust and progress has been made in the aboveoutlined initiatives as management continues to closely monitor industry and regulatory developments pertaining to the transition 

upon commencement of the program we conducted an impact assessment to identify all areas that were likely to be impacted by the libor transition the impact assessment identified where liborrelated products systems models policies and procedures existed we used the assessment results to develop a robust transition roadmap and an implementation plan which continues to evolve based on market and regulatory developments key libor transition efforts over the course of 2021 include but are not limited to the following 

• upgraded standard form provisions and issued implementation guidance to require use of reference rate fallback language in any new and existing libor contracts in connection with contract amendments made in the ordinary course of business 

• launched new product issuances with alternative reference rates 

• completed operational readiness of systems models and applications to handle all potential alternative reference rates 

• remediated legacy contracts that reference nonus dollar libor in preparation for the december 31 2021 cessation of libor quotations for nonus dollar currencies 

• analyzed existing fallback language in legacy contracts to assess robustness and devise a strategy for those requiring remediation 



• continued to develop and enhance internet and intranet sites for the libor transition and 

• participated in industry and arrc working groups to ascertain market developments and assess the impact to us and our customers 

capital markets 

a key component of our capital markets activities is the underwriting and distribution of corporate credit facilities to partially finance merger and acquisition transactions for our clients we have a rigorous risk management process around these activities including a limit structure capping our underwriting risk our potential loss and sublimits for specific asset classes further the ability to approve underwriting exposure is delegated only to senior level individuals in the credit risk management and capital markets organizations with each transaction adjudicated in the loan underwriting approval committee 

mortgage servicing rights 

we have market risk associated with the value of residential msrs which are impacted by various types of inherent risks including duration basis convexity volatility and yield curve 

as part of our overall risk management strategy relative to the fair market value of the msrs we enter into various freestanding derivatives such as interest rate swaps interest rate swaptions interest rate futures and forward contracts to purchase mortgagebacked securities to economically hedge the changes in fair value as of december 31 2021 and 2020 the fair value of our msrs was 10 billion and 658 million respectively and the total notional amount of related derivative contracts was 118 billion and 114 billion respectively gains and losses on msrs and the related derivatives used for hedging are included in mortgage banking fees in the consolidated statements of operations 

as with our traded market riskbased activities earnings at risk excludes the impact of msrs msrs are captured under our single price risk management framework that is used for calculating a management value at risk that is consistent with the definition used by banking regulators 

trading risk 

we are exposed to market risk primarily through client facilitation activities including derivatives and foreign exchange products as well as underwriting and market making activities exposure is created as a result of changes in interest rates and related basis spreads and volatility foreign exchange rates equity prices and credit spreads on a select range of interest rates foreign exchange commodities equity securities corporate bonds and secondary loan instrumentsthese securities underwriting and trading activities are conducted through cbna ccmi and jmp 

client facilitation activities consist primarily of interest rate derivatives financially settled commodity derivatives and foreign exchange contracts where we enter into offsetting trades with a separate counterparty or exchange to manage our market risk exposure in addition to the aforementioned activities we operate trading desks covering secondary loans corporate bonds and equity securities all with the objective to meet secondary liquidity needs of our issuing clients’ transactions and investor clients we do not engage in any trading activities with the intent to benefit from shortterm price differences 

we record these rate and commodity derivatives and foreign exchange contracts as derivative assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets trading assets and liabilities are carried at fair value with income earned related to these activities included in net interest income changes in fair value of trading assets and liabilities are reflected in other income a component of noninterest income on the consolidated statements of operations 

market risk governance 

the market risk limit setting process is established inline with the formal enterprise risk appetite process and policy this appetite reflects the strategic and enterprise level articulation of opportunities for creating franchise value set to the boundaries of how much market risk to assume dealing authorities represent the key control tool in the management of market risk that allows the cascading of the risk appetite throughout the enterprise a dealing authority sets the operational scope and tolerances within which a business andor trading desk is permitted to operate which is reviewed at least annually dealing authorities are structured to accommodate client facing trades and hedges needed to manage the risk profile primary responsibility for keeping within established tolerances resides with the business key risk indicators including var open foreign 



currency positions and single name risk are monitored on a daily basis and reported against tolerances consistent with our risk appetite and business strategy to relevant business line management and risk counterparts 

market risk measurement 

we use var as a statistical measure for estimating potential exposure of our traded market risk in normal market conditions our var framework for risk management and regulatory reporting is the same risk management var is based on a one day holding period to a 99 confidence level whereas regulatory var is based on a tenday holding period to the same confidence level in addition to var nonstatistical measurements for measuring risk are employed such as sensitivity analysis market value and stress testing 

our market risk platform and associated market risk and valuation models capture correlation effects across all our “covered positions” and allow for aggregation of market risk across products risk types business lines and legal entities we measure monitor and report market risk for both management and regulatory capital purposes 

var overview 

the market risk measurement model is based on historical simulation the var measure estimates the extent of any fair value losses on trading positions that may occur due to broad market movements general var such as changes in the level of interest rates foreign exchange rates equity prices and commodity prices it is calculated on the basis that current positions remain broadly unaltered over the course of a given holding period it is assumed that markets are sufficiently liquid to allow the business to close its positions if required within this holding period var’s benefit is that it captures the historic correlations of a portfolio based on the composition of our “covered positions” we also use a standardized addon approach for the loan trading and high yield bond desks’ specific risk capital which estimates the extent of any losses that may occur from factors other than broad market movements the general var approach is expressed in terms of a confidence level over the past 500 trading days the internal var measure used as the basis of the main var trading limits is a 99 confidence level with a one day holding period meaning that a loss greater than the var is expected to occur on average on only one day in 100 trading days ie 1 of the time theoretically there should be a loss event greater than var two to three times per year the regulatory measure of var is done at a 99 confidence level with a tenday holding period the historical market data applied to calculate the var is updated on a twobusiness day lag refer to “market risk regulatory capital” below for details of our tenday var metrics for the quarters ended december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively including high low average and period end var for interest rate and foreign exchange rate risks as well as total var 



market risk regulatory capital 

the us banking regulators’ “market risk rule” covers the calculation of market risk capital for the purposes of the market risk rule all of our client facing trades and associated hedges maintain a net low risk and do qualify as “covered positions” the internal management var measure is calculated based on the same population of trades that is utilized for regulatory var 



stressed var 

svar is an extension of var as it uses a longer historical lookback horizon that is fixed from january 3 2005 this is done not only to identify headline risks from more volatile periods but also to provide a counterbalance to var which may be low during periods of low volatility the holding period for profit and loss determination is ten days in addition to risk management purposes svar is also a component of market risk regulatory capital we calculate svar daily under its own dynamic window regime in a dynamic window regime values of the tenday 99 var are calculated over all possible 260day periods that can be obtained from the complete historical data set refer to “market risk regulatory capital” above for details of svar metrics including high low average and period end svar for the combined portfolio 

sensitivity analysis 

sensitivity analysis is the measure of exposure to a single risk factor such as a one basis point change in rates or credit spread we conduct and monitor sensitivity on interest rates basis spreads foreign exchange exposures option prices and credit spreads whereas var is based on previous moves in market risk factors over recent periods it may not be an accurate predictor of future market moves sensitivity analysis complements var as it provides an indication of risk relative to each factor irrespective of historical market moves and is an effective tool in evaluating the appropriateness of hedging strategies and concentrations 

stress testing 

conducting a stress test of a portfolio consists of running risk models with the inclusion of key variables that simulate various historical or hypothetical scenarios for historical stress tests profit and loss results are simulated for selected time periods corresponding to the most volatile underlying returns while hypothetical stress tests aim to consider concentration risk illiquidity under stressed market conditions and risk arising from our trading activities that may not be fully captured by our other risk measurement methodologies hypothetical scenarios also assume that market moves happen simultaneously and no repositioning or hedging activity takes place to mitigate losses as market events unfold we generate stress tests of our trading positions on a daily basis for example we currently include a stress test that simulates a “lehmantype” crisis scenario by taking the worst 20trading day peak to trough moves for the various risk factors that go into var from that period and assumes they occurred simultaneously 



var model review and validation 

market risk measurement models used are independently reviewed and subject to ongoing performance analysis by the model owners the independent review and validation focuses on the model methodology market data and performance independent review of market risk measurement models is the responsibility of citizens’ model risk management and validation team aspects covered include challenging the assumptions used the quantitative techniques employed and the theoretical justification underpinning them and an assessment of the soundness of the required data over time where possible the quantitative impact of the major underlying modeling assumptions will be estimated eg through developing alternative models results of such reviews are shared with our us banking regulators the market risk models may be periodically enhanced due to changes in market price levels and price action regime behavior the market risk management and validation team will conduct internal validation before a new or changed model element is implemented and before a change is made to a market data mapping 

var backtesting 

backtesting is one form of validation of the var model and is run daily the market risk rule requires a comparison of our internal var measure to the actual net trading revenue excluding fees commissions reserves intraday trading and net interest income for each day over the preceding year the most recent 250 business days any observed loss in excess of the var number is taken as an exception the level of exceptions determines the multiplication factor used to derive the var and svarbased capital requirement for regulatory reporting purposes when applicable we perform subportfolio backtesting as required under the market risk rule using models approved by our banking regulators for interest rate credit spread and foreign exchange positions 

the following graph shows our daily net trading revenue and total internal modeled var for the year ended december 31 2021

delivering well for stakeholders through the pandemic 

the coronavirus pandemic and resulting reactions such as lockdowns safety protocols unprecedented government measures to shore up the economy and drastic changes to daily life have been unique and remarkable these stresses have required a new level of resilience and adaptability and citizens has risen to meet these challenges so we can do more for our customers communities colleagues and shareholders 

for our customers we continued to provide support advice and guidance during a time of tremendous need our consumer banking business has provided vital branch services safely and with minimal disruption and has offered loan forbearance to customers beginning in march 2020 and through december 31 2020 we granted payment forbearance relief to approximately 159000 retail customers representing approximately 8 of the retail loan portfolio at december 31 2020 loans remaining in forbearance had decreased to approximately 23 of the retail loan portfolio 

our commercial banking team has worked with clients on loan modifications and securing additional liquidity while maintaining topofpeer satisfaction ratings beginning in march 2020 and through december 31 2020 we granted payment deferrals to approximately 490 commercial clients on loans totaling approximately 32 billion as of december 31 2020 this decreased to 19 commercial clients with deferrals on approximately 290 million of loans 

we also took action to provide relief through the sba’s paycheck protection program “ppp” delivering approximately 48 billion of loans to small and mediumsized business clients with an average loan size of approximately 98000 approximately 84 of the loans were under 100000 and 93 of the loans were to businesses with fewer than 25 employees supporting over 540000 jobs as of december 31 2020 approximately 565 million of those loans have been forgiven by the sba we are building on this success to deliver more relief 



for our clients through the expansion of the ppp program under the consolidated appropriations act 2021 passed at the end of 2020 

for our colleagues our commitment to their wellness including physical financial and mental wellness has continued to be a central focus during the covid19 crisis in addition to ensuring that colleagues had the necessary tools and resources to continue to serve our customers safely we shifted approximately 10000 of our colleagues to a work from home environment and implemented several programs to support their wellness and their ability to maintain worklife balance some of the actions taken to support colleagues include providing additional paid time off for all colleagues providing premium pay to colleagues serving customers in the branch or office making changes for productionbased incentive plans to address lower production providing mental health and parental resources and enhancing recognition awards we have successfully deployed colleagues into new roles across the organization to meet pandemicdriven demands and we are committed to attracting and developing high caliber talent to further strengthen our team and position us well for our multiyear transformation efforts

competition 

the financial services industry is highly competitive our branch footprint is in the new england midatlantic and midwest regions though certain lines of business serve national markets within these markets we face competition from community banks superregional and national financial institutions credit unions savings and loan associations mortgage banking firms consumer finance companies securities brokerage firms insurance companies money market funds hedge funds and private equity firms some of our larger competitors may make available to their customers a broader array of products pricing and structure alternatives while some smaller competitors may have more liberal lending policies and processes competition among providers of financial products and services continues to increase with consumers having the opportunity to select from a growing variety of traditional and nontraditional alternatives the ability of nonbanking financial institutions including fintech companies to provide services previously limited to commercial banks has also intensified competition 

in consumer banking the industry has become increasingly dependent on and oriented toward technologydriven delivery systems permitting transactions to be conducted through telephone online and mobile channels in addition technology has lowered barriers to entry and made it possible for nonbank institutions to attract funds and provide lending and other financial products and services the emergence of digitalonly banking models has increased and we expect this trend to continue given their lower cost structure these models are often on average able to offer higher rates on deposit products than retail banking institutions with a traditional branch footprint the primary factors driving competition for loans and deposits are interest rates fees charged tailored value propositions to different customer segments customer service levels convenience including branch locations and hours of operation and the range of products and services offered 

in commercial banking there is intense competition for quality loan originations from traditional banking institutions particularly large regional banks as well as commercial finance companies leasing companies and other nonbank lenders and institutional investors including collateralized loan obligation managers hedge funds and private equity firms some larger competitors including certain national banks that compete in our market area may offer a broader array of products and due to their asset size may sometimes be in a position to hold 



more exposure on their own balance sheet we compete on a number of factors including providing innovative corporate finance solutions quality of customer service and execution range of products offered price and reputation 

human capital management 

our ultimate goal is to create an environment where colleagues feel valued and would like to build their careers thereby contributing to the creation of longterm stockholder value our journey over the past few years has been one of accelerated progress and change in step with rapidly evolving market and talent expectations we have been on the path to digitization transforming how we work and establishing a different mix of necessary capabilities for the future while at the same time facilitating continued evolution of our culture 

health safety and wellness 

colleague wellness has always been central to our consciousness and strategy and it was a priority when we were designing our johnston ri campus which opened in 2018 and includes onsite fitness and wellness centers as well as walking paths and various sports and recreation facilities our commitment to colleagues’ wellness including physical financial and mental wellness has continued to be a central focus during the covid19 pandemic and associated lockdowns in addition to ensuring that our colleagues had the necessary tools and resources to continue to serve our customers safely we shifted approximately 10000 of our colleagues to a work from home environment and implemented several programs to support their wellness and their ability to maintain worklife balance these programs included additional paid time off to address personal circumstances and for covid19 quarantine and recovery mental health and parental resources as well as committing to no increases in colleagues’ medical premiums for the 2021 year with regard to financial support during the onset of the crisis we provided premium pay and an increased overtime rate for colleagues continuing to serve customers in the branches and office and also made changes to our productionbased pay plans to take into consideration decreased production 

diversity equity and inclusion 

we are committed to building deep partnerships among our customers colleagues and communities and fostering a culture where all stakeholders feel respected valued and heard and have a sense of belonging a core tenet of our business strategy is growth and innovation and a hallmark of that strategy is to focus on the diversity of our colleagues customers and communities and the inclusivity of our culture to that end we have been on a multiyear journey to enhance awareness and improve capabilities and opportunities within the organization and in our communities which has accelerated since we became an independent publiclytraded company in 2015 

as part of that journey we have conducted a thirdparty audit to debias our people practices have put into place several recruiting and development initiatives and provide unconscious bias training we acknowledge that there is an opportunity to further increase the representation of women and people of color at all levels of our organization in particular in senior roles information regarding colleague demographics can be found on our website to enable further progress we have implemented partnerships with community organizations to help identify qualified diverse candidates and have expanded our diverse hire commitment through which we interview a slate of at least 50 diverse candidates for senior openings in addition our development programs are designed to build a strong pipeline of diverse emerging talent internally a key catalyst for change within our organization is our six business resource groups “brgs” citizens win women’s impact network citizens elev8 rising professionals prism multicultural citizens pride lgbtq citizens veterans and citizens awake disability awareness each of which is sponsored by senior leaders brg members serve as cultural ambassadors within the business to help formulate and influence our diversity equity and inclusion strategy and to identify and solve related issues 

we are also committed to ensuring that equal pay is received for equal work throughout our organization and we engage an independent thirdparty expert to regularly conduct a pay equity analysis that accounts for factors that appropriately explain differences in pay such as performance time in role and experience additional information about this analysis can be found on our website 

colleague growth and development 

the world in which our business operates is changing rapidly in nearly every dimension and the skills required of our colleagues to meet the evolving needs of customers are changing at an accelerated pace our 



human capital strategy focuses on creating a work environment where every colleague is always growing thriving performing and futureready 

we are in the midst of executing on a largescale transformation agenda including a path to endtoend digitization and transforming how we work we are working to ensure that our colleagues are reframing their mindsets behaviors and capabilities for the future we invest significant resources in colleague development and offer various programs aimed at equipping colleagues with the skills necessary to not only excel in their current roles but to build competencies that will enable them to be highly valuable contributors now and in the future and ensure they are in step with changes in the market our programs build relevant critical skills such as leadership agile digital innovation data and analytics and coaching and advising in order to effectively strengthen the necessary workforce capabilities for our organization to enable development of these skills we have implemented resources experiences and technologies to facilitate quick consumption of new bodies of knowledge and skills one example of this is learning academies which are enabled by our new learning experience platform to offer a collection of specifically curated learning experiences and content for a particular area of expertise such as engineering we have also reframed our performance management process in order to further enable colleague success with ongoing checkins and feedback as another step toward colleagues being able to contribute at their highest potential 

engagement and communication 

we use mckinsey  company’s organizational health index “ohi” survey to understand colleagues’ viewpoints about the company on a wide range of factors to inform decisions regarding initiatives that will drive sustained toptier performance and growth in 2020 our ohi overall score reached the top quartile reflecting a 15point improvement since 2014  our success depends on employees understanding how their work contributes to our overall strategy and we use a variety of platforms and forums to facilitate open and direct communication these include communications from our ceo and management team through live stream forums “let’s connect” sessions hosted by members of the management team and engagement through our brgs 

employees 

the table below presents our parttime and fulltime equivalent employees by region as of december 31 2020 none of our employees are parties to a collective bargaining agreement we consider our relationship with our employees to be good and have not experienced interruptions of operations due to labor disagreements 



consumer banking personnel make up a workforce of approximately 4800 branch colleagues across approximately 1000 branches and include approximately 1420 specialists covering lending savings and investment needs as well as a broad range of small business products and services 

beginning june 30 2020 we allowed colleagues to return to our offices in 10 states and portions of three others approximately 6500 nonbranch colleagues are normally assigned to offices in these states and approximately 10 of these are considered essential and work consistently in the office return to office for our other colleagues is voluntary at this time 

regulation and supervision 

our operations are subject to extensive regulation supervision and examination under federal and state laws and regulations these laws and regulations cover all aspects of our business including lending practices deposit insurance customer privacy and cybersecurity capital adequacy and planning liquidity safety and soundness consumer protection and disclosure permissible activities and investments and certain transactions with affiliates these laws and regulations are intended primarily for the protection of depositors the deposit insurance fund and the banking system as a whole and not for the protection of shareholders or other investors the discussion below outlines the material elements of selected laws and regulations applicable to us and our subsidiaries changes in applicable law or regulation and in their interpretation and application by regulatory agencies and other governmental authorities cannot be predicted but may have a material effect on our 



business financial condition or results of operations 

we and our subsidiaries are subject to examinations by federal and state banking regulators as well as the sec finra and various state insurance and securities regulators in some cases regulatory agencies may take supervisory actions that may not be publicly disclosed and such actions may restrict or limit our activities or activities of our subsidiaries as part of our regular examination process regulators may advise us to operate under various restrictions as a prudential matter we have periodically received requests for information from regulatory authorities at the federal and state level including from banking securities and insurance regulators state attorneys general federal agencies or law enforcement authorities and other regulatory authorities concerning our business practices such requests are considered incidental to the normal conduct of business for a further discussion of how regulatory actions may impact our business see item 1a “risk factors” for additional information regarding regulatory matters see note 24 in item 8 

overview 

we are a bank holding company under the bank holding company act we have elected to be treated as a financial holding company under amendments to the bank holding company act as effected by glba as such we are subject to the supervision examination and reporting requirements of the bank holding company act and the regulations of the frb including through the federal reserve bank of boston under the system of “functional regulation” established under the bank holding company act the frb serves as the primary regulator of our consolidated organization and the sec serves as the primary regulator of our brokerdealer and investment advisory subsidiaries and directly regulates the activities of those subsidiaries with the frb exercising a supervisory role 

the federal banking regulators have authority to approve or disapprove mergers acquisitions consolidations the establishment of branches and similar corporate actions these banking regulators also have the power to prevent the continuance or development of unsafe or unsound banking practices or other violations of law federal law governs the activities in which cbna engages including the investments it makes and the aggregate amount of available credit that it may grant to one borrower various consumer and compliance laws and regulations also affect its operations the actions the frb takes to implement monetary policy also affect cbna 

in addition cbna is subject to regulation supervision and examination by the cfpb with respect to consumer protection laws and regulations the cfpb has broad authority to regulate the offering and provision of consumer financial products by depository institutions such as cbna with more than 10 billion in total assets the cfpb may promulgate rules under a variety of consumer financial protection statutes including the truth in lending act the electronic funds transfer act and the real estate settlement procedures act 

tailoring of prudential requirements 

in october 2019 the frb and the other federal banking regulators finalized rules that tailor the application of the enhanced prudential standards to bank holding companies and depository institutions to implement the economic growth regulatory relief and consumer protection act of 2018 “egrrcpa” amendments to the doddfrank act “tailoring rules” the tailoring rules assign each us bank holding company with 100 billion or more in total consolidated assets as well as its bank subsidiaries to one of four categories based on its size and five other riskbased indicators 

i crossjurisdictional activity 

ii weighted shortterm wholesale funding “wstwf” 

iii nonbank assets 

iv offbalance sheet exposure and 

v status as a us global systemically important bank 

under the tailoring rules we are subject to “category iv standards” which apply to banking organizations with at least 100 billion in total consolidated assets that do not meet any of the thresholds specified for categories i through iii accordingly category iv firms such as us 

i are no longer subject to any lcr requirement or in certain cases are subject to reduced requirements 



ii remain not subject to advanced approaches capital requirements 

iii remain eligible to optout of the requirement to recognize most elements of accumulated other comprehensive income in regulatory capital 

iv remain not subject to the supplementary leverage ratio 

v remain not subject to the countercyclical capital buffer 

vi are no longer subject to companyrun stress testing requirements 

vii became subject to supervisory stress testing on a biennial instead of annual basis 

viii remain subject to requirements to develop and maintain a capital plan on an annual basis and 

ix remain subject to certain liquidity risk management and risk committee requirements 

we discuss other elements of the tailoring rules where relevant below the liquidity requirements are described below under “—liquidity requirements” and their stress testing requirements are described below under “—capital planning and stress testing requirements” 

  financial holding company regulation 

the bank holding company act generally restricts bank holding companies from engaging in business activities other than banking managing or controlling banks furnishing services to or performing services for subsidiaries and activities that the frb has determined to be closely related to banking for so long as they continue to meet the eligibility requirements for financial holding company status financial holding companies may engage in a broader range of activities including securities underwriting and dealing insurance underwriting and brokerage merchant banking and other activities that are determined by the frb in coordination with the treasury department to be “financial in nature or incidental thereto” or that the frb determines unilaterally to be “complementary” to financial activities in addition a financial holding company may conduct permissible new financial activities or acquire permissible nonbank financial companies with afterthefact notice to the frb 

as noted above we currently have elected to be treated as a financial holding company under amendments to the bank holding company act as effected by glba to maintain financial holding company status a financial holding company and all of its insured depository institution subsidiaries must remain “well capitalized” and “well managed” as described below under “federal deposit insurance act” and maintain a cra rating of at least “satisfactory” see “community reinvestment act” below if a financial holding company ceases to meet the capital and management requirements the frb’s regulations provide that the financial holding company must enter into an agreement with the frb to comply with all applicable capital and management requirements until the financial holding company returns to compliance the frb may impose limitations or conditions on the conduct of its activities and the company may not commence any of the broader financial activities permissible for financial holding companies or acquire a company engaged in such financial activities without prior approval of the frb in addition the failure to meet such requirements could result in other material restrictions on the activities of the financial holding company may also adversely affect the financial holding company’s ability to enter into certain transactions including acquisition transactions or obtain necessary approvals in connection therewith and may result in the bank holding company losing financial holding company status any restrictions imposed on our activities by the frb may not necessarily be made known to the public if the company does not return to compliance within 180 days which period may be extended the frb may require the financial holding company to divest its subsidiary depository institutions or to discontinue or divest investments in companies engaged in activities permissible only for a bank holding company electing to be treated as a financial holding company if any insured depository institution subsidiary of a financial holding company fails to maintain a cra rating of at least “satisfactory” the financial holding company would be subject to restrictions on certain new activities and acquisitions bank holding companies and banks must also be both well capitalized and well managed in order to acquire banks located outside their home state 

capital 

the us basel iii rules apply to us these rules establish riskbased and leverage capital requirements the riskbased requirements are based on a banking organization’s riskweighted assets also known as rwa which reflect the organization’s on and offbalance sheet exposures subject to risk weights the leverage requirements are based on a banking organization’s average consolidated onbalance sheet assets for more detail on our regulatory capital see the “capital and regulatory matters” section of item 7 



we calculate rwa using the standardized approach and have made the onetime election to optout of aoci as a result we are not required to recognize in regulatory capital the impacts of net unrealized gains and losses included within aoci for debt securities that are available for sale or held to maturity accumulated net gains and losses on cash flow hedges and certain defined benefit pension plan assets 

on january 1 2020 we adopted the cecl accounting standard in reaction to the covid19 pandemic and associated lockdowns on september 30 2020 the frb and the other federal banking regulators adopted a final rule relative to regulatory capital treatment of acl under cecl this rule allowed electing banking organizations to delay the estimated impact of cecl on regulatory capital for a twoyear period ending january 1 2022 followed by a threeyear transition period ending january 1 2025 to phasein the aggregate amount of the capital benefit provided during the initial twoyear delay 

under the us basel iii rules the minimum capital ratios are 

• 45 cet1 capital to riskweighted assets 

• 60 tier 1 capital that is cet1 capital plus additional tier 1 capital to riskweighted assets 

• 80 total capital that is tier 1 capital plus tier 2 capital to riskweighted assets and 

• 40 tier 1 capital to total average consolidated assets as defined under us basel iii standardized approach known as the “leverage ratio” 

effective october 1 2020 the frb finalized our stress capital buffer “scb” of 34 which replaced the capital conservation buffer “ccb” of 25 our scb of 34 is based on the results of the 2020 doddfrank act stress test “dfast” in connection with the related ccar and is imposed on top of each of the three minimum riskweighted asset ratios listed above for category iv firms like us the frb has stated that the scb will be recalibrated with each biennial supervisory stress test and updated annually to reflect our planned common stock dividends and common share buybacks banking institutions that fail to meet the effective minimum ratios with the scb taken into account will be subject to constraints on capital distributions including dividends and share repurchases and certain discretionary executive compensation the severity of the constraints depends on the amount of the shortfall and the institution’s “eligible retained income” defined as the greater of four quarter trailing net income net of distributions and tax effects not reflected in net income or the average four quarter trailing net income on september 30 2020 the frb issued a proposed rule to make conforming changes to its capital plan rule stress capital buffer requirements and capital planning requirements to be consistent with the tailoring rules framework under the proposal category iv firms like us would have the ability to elect to participate in the supervisory stress test and receive an updated scb requirement in a year in which they are not subject to the supervisory stress test for more details see “—capital planning and stress testing requirements” below and the “capital and regulatory matters” section of item 7 

we are also subject to the frbs riskbased capital requirements for market risk see the “market risk” section of item 7 

  liquidity requirements 

the federal banking regulators have adopted the basel iiibased us lcr rule which is a quantitative liquidity metric designed to ensure that a covered bank or bank holding company maintains an adequate level of unencumbered highquality liquid assets to cover expected net cash outflows over a 30day time horizon under an acute liquidity stress scenario as noted above under the tailoring rules category iv firms with less than 50 billion in wstwf including us are no longer subject to any lcr requirement 

the basel iii framework also includes a second liquidity standard the nsfr which is designed to promote more medium and longterm funding of the assets and activities of banks over a oneyear time horizon on october 20 2020 the federal banking regulators issued a final rule to implement the nsfr for large us banking organizations under the final rule category iv firms with less than 50 billion in weighted shortterm wholesale funding including us will not be subject to the nsfr requirement 

finally per the liquidity rules included in the frb’s enhanced prudential standards adopted pursuant to section 165 of the doddfrank act referred to above under “—tailoring of prudential requirements” we are also required to maintain a buffer of highly liquid assets based on projected funding needs for 30 days under the tailoring rules the liquidity buffer requirements continue to apply to category iv firms such as us and remain subject to liquidity risk management requirements however these requirements are now tailored such that we required to 

i calculate collateral positions monthly as opposed to weekly 



ii establish a more limited set of liquidity risk limits than was previously required and 

iii monitor fewer elements of intraday liquidity risk exposures than were previously monitored 

we are also now subject to liquidity stress testing quarterly rather than monthly and are required to report liquidity data on a monthly basis 

  capital planning and stress testing requirements 

under the tailoring rules category iv firms such as us are subject to biennial supervisory stress testing and are exempt from companyrun stress testing and related disclosure requirements category iv firms are also no longer required to submit resolution plans the frb continues to supervise category iv firms on an ongoing basis including evaluation of the capital adequacy and capital planning processes during offcycle years we remain subject to the requirement to develop maintain and submit an annual capital plan for review and approval by our board of directors or one of its committees as well as fr y14 reporting requirements 

on september 30 2020 the frb issued a proposed rule to make conforming changes to its capital plan rule stress capital buffer requirements and capital planning requirements to be consistent with the tailoring rules framework under the proposal category iv firms like us would have the ability to elect to participate in the supervisory stress test and receive an updated scb requirement in a year in which they are not subject to the supervisory stress test for purposes of calculating the scb in 2021 the proposed rule would require us to notify the frb of our intention to participate in the 2021 supervisory stress test by april 5 2021 

regulations relating to capital planning regulatory reporting and stress capital buffer requirements applicable to firms like us are presently subject to rule making and potential further guidance and interpretation by the applicable federal regulators we will continue to evaluate the impact of these and any other prudential regulatory changes including their potential resultant changes in our regulatory and compliance costs and expenses 

for more detail on our capital planning and stress testing requirements see the “capital and regulatory matters” section of item 7 

standards for safety and soundness 

the fdia requires the frb occ and fdic to prescribe operational and managerial standards for all insured depository institutions including cbna the agencies have adopted regulations and interagency guidelines that set forth the safety and soundness standards used to identify and address problems at insured depository institutions before capital becomes impaired if an agency determines that a bank fails to satisfy any standard it may require the bank to submit an acceptable plan to achieve compliance consistent with deadlines for the submission and review of such safety and soundness compliance plans if after being notified to submit a compliance plan an institution fails to submit an acceptable compliance plan or fails in any material respect to implement an acceptable compliance plan the agency must issue an order directing action to correct the deficiency and may issue an order directing other actions of the types to which an undercapitalized institution is subject under the fdia see “federal deposit insurance act” below if an institution fails to comply with such an order the agency may seek to enforce such order in judicial proceedings and to impose civil money penalties 

federal deposit insurance act 

the fdia requires among other things that the federal banking regulators take “prompt corrective action” with respect to depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements as described above in “capital” the fdia sets forth the following five capital categories “wellcapitalized” “adequately capitalized” “undercapitalized” “significantly undercapitalized” and “critically undercapitalized” a depository institution’s capital category depends upon how its capital levels compare with various relevant capital measures and certain other factors that are established by regulation the federal banking regulators must take certain mandatory supervisory actions and are authorized to take other discretionary actions with respect to institutions that are undercapitalized significantly undercapitalized or critically undercapitalized with the actions becoming more restrictive and punitive the lower the institution’s capital category under existing rules an institution that is not an advanced approaches institution is deemed to be “well capitalized” if it has a cet1 ratio of at least 65 a tier 1 capital ratio of at least 8 a total capital ratio of at least 10 and a tier 1 leverage ratio of at least 5 

the fdia’s prompt corrective action provisions only apply to depository institutions and not to bank holding companies the frb’s regulations applicable to bank holding companies separately define “well capitalized” for bank holding companies to require maintaining a tier 1 capital ratio of at least 6 and a total capital ratio of at least 10 as described above under “—financial holding company regulation” a financial holding company that is not wellcapitalized and wellmanaged or whose bank subsidiaries are not well 



capitalized and well managed under applicable prompt corrective action standards may be restricted in certain of its activities and ultimately may lose financial holding company status as of december 31 2020 the parent company and cbna were wellcapitalized 

the fdia prohibits insured banks from accepting brokered deposits or offering interest rates on any deposits significantly higher than the prevailing rate in the bank’s normal market area or nationally depending upon where the deposits are solicited unless it is “wellcapitalized” or it is “adequately capitalized” and receives a waiver from the fdic a bank that is “adequately capitalized” and accepts brokered deposits under a waiver from the fdic may not pay an interest rate on any deposit in excess of 75 basis points over certain prevailing market rates the fdia imposes no such restrictions on a bank that is “wellcapitalized” 

deposit insurance 

the fdia requires cbna to pay deposit insurance assessments fdic assessment rates for large institutions are calculated based on one of two scorecards one for most large institutions that have more than 10 billion in assets and another for “highly complex” institutions that have over 50 billion in assets and are fully owned by a parent with over 500 billion in assets each scorecard has a performance score and a lossseverity score that are combined to produce a total score which is translated into an initial assessment rate in calculating these scores the fdic utilizes the camels ratings and forwardlooking financial measures to assess an institution’s ability to withstand assetrelated stress and fundingrelated stress the fdic has the ability to make discretionary adjustments to the total score based upon significant risk factors that are not adequately captured in the scorecard the total score is then translated to an initial base assessment rate on a nonlinear sharplyincreasing scale 

the deposit insurance assessment is calculated based on average consolidated total assets less average tangible equity of the insured depository institution during the assessment period deposit insurance assessments are also affected by the minimum reserve ratio with respect to the deposit insurance fund “dif” the fdia established a minimum reserve ratio of the dif of 115 prior to september 2020 and 135 thereafter as of september 30 2020 the reserve ratio of the dif was 130 on september 15 2020 the fdic’s board of directors voted to adopt a restoration plan to restore the dif reserve ratio to at least 135 within 8 years as required by the fdia 

dividends 

various federal statutory provisions and regulations as well as regulatory expectations limit the amount of dividends that we and our subsidiaries may pay 

our payment of dividends to our stockholders is subject to the oversight of the frb in particular the frb reviews the dividend policies and share repurchases of a large bank holding company based on capital plans submitted as part of the ccar process and on the results of stress tests as discussed above in addition to other limitations our ability to make any capital distributions including dividends and share repurchases is contingent on the frb’s nonobjection to such planned distributions included in our submitted capital plan or the frb’s authorization to make distributions if we are exempt from the requirement to submit a capital plan see “—capital” and “—capital planning and stress testing requirements” above 

dividends payable by cbna as a national bank subsidiary are limited to the lesser of the amount calculated under a “recent earnings” test and an “undivided profits” test under the recent earnings test a dividend may not be paid if the total of all dividends declared by a bank in any calendar year is in excess of the current year’s net income combined with the retained net income of the two preceding years less any required transfers to surplus unless the national bank obtains the approval of the occ under the undivided profits test a dividend may not be paid in excess of the entity’s “undivided profits” generally accumulated net profits that have not been paid out as dividends or transferred to surplus federal bank regulatory agencies have issued policy statements that provide that fdicinsured depository institutions and their holding companies should generally pay dividends only out of their current operating earnings 



support of subsidiary bank 

under section 616 of the doddfrank act which codifies the frb’s longstanding “source of strength” doctrine the parent company must serve as a source of financial and managerial strength for our depository institution subsidiary the statute defines “source of financial strength” as the ability to provide financial assistance in the event of the financial distress at the insured depository institution the frb may require that the parent company provide such support at times even when the parent company may not have the financial resources to do so or when doing so may not serve our interests or those of our shareholders or creditors in addition any capital loans by a bank holding company to its subsidiary bank are subordinate in right of payment to deposits and to certain other indebtedness of such subsidiary bank in the event of a bank holding company’s bankruptcy any commitment by the bank holding company to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to a priority of payment 

transactions with affiliates and insiders 

sections 23a and 23b of the federal reserve act and related frb rules including regulation w restrict cbna from extending credit to or engaging in certain other transactions with the parent company and its nonbank subsidiaries these restrictions place limits on certain specified “covered transactions” between bank subsidiaries and their affiliates which must be limited to 10 of a bank’s capital and surplus for any one affiliate and 20 for all affiliates furthermore within the foregoing limitations as to amount certain covered transactions must meet specified collateral requirements ranging from 100 to 130 covered transactions are defined to include among other things a loan or extension of credit as well as a purchase of securities issued by an affiliate a purchase of assets unless otherwise exempted by the frb from the affiliate the acceptance of securities issued by the affiliate as collateral for a loan derivatives transactions and securities lending transactions where the bank has credit exposure to an affiliate and the issuance of a guarantee acceptance or letter of credit on behalf of an affiliate all covered transactions including certain additional transactions such as transactions with a third party in which an affiliate has a financial interest must be conducted on market terms the frb enforces these restrictions and we are audited for compliance 

section 23b prohibits an institution from engaging in certain transactions with affiliates unless the transactions are on terms substantially the same or at least as favorable to the bank as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with nonaffiliated companies transactions between a bank and any of its subsidiaries that are engaged in certain financial activities may be subject to the affiliated transaction limits the frb also may designate banking subsidiaries as affiliates 

pursuant to frb regulation o we are also subject to quantitative restrictions on extensions of credit to executive officers directors principal stockholders and their related interests in general such extensions of credit may not exceed certain dollar limitations must be made on substantially the same terms including interest rates and collateral as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with third parties and must not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features certain extensions of credit also require the approval of our board 

volcker rule 

the doddfrank act prohibits banks and their affiliates from engaging in proprietary trading and investing in sponsoring and having certain relationships with private funds such as certain hedge funds or private equity funds the statutory provision is commonly called the “volcker rule” in october 2019 the frb occ fdic the sec and the cftc collectively the “volcker agencies” finalized amendments to their regulations to tailor the volcker rule’s compliance requirements to the amount of a firm’s trading activity revise the definition of trading account clarify certain key provisions in the volcker rule and modify the information companies are required to provide the volcker agencies under those amendments we expect that we would be regarded as having “moderate” trading assets and liabilities and therefore subject to a requirement to have a simplified compliance program that is appropriate for our activities size scope and complexity in june 2020 the volcker agencies finalized other regulations modifying the volcker rule’s prohibition on banking entities investing in or sponsoring hedge funds or private equity funds referred to under the rule as covered funds this final rule became effective october 1 2020 we do not expect either of these regulatory amendments to the volcker rule to have a material impact on citizens 



consumer financial protection regulations 

the retail activities of banks are subject to a variety of statutes and regulations designed to protect consumers and promote lending to various sectors of the economy and population these laws include but are not limited to the equal credit opportunity act the fair debt collection practices act the fair credit reporting act the truth in lending act the home mortgage disclosure act the service members civil relief act the expedited funds availability act the right to financial privacy act the truth in savings act the electronic funds transfer act and their respective federal regulations and state law counterparts 

in addition to these federal laws and regulations the guidance and interpretations of the various federal agencies charged with the responsibility of implementing such regulations also influences loan and deposit operations 

the cfpb has broad rulemaking supervisory examination and enforcement authority over various consumer financial protection laws including the laws referenced above fair lending laws and certain other statutes the cfpb also has examination and primary enforcement authority with respect to depository institutions with 10 billion or more in assets including the authority to prevent unfair deceptive or abusive acts or practices in connection with the offering of consumer financial products 

the doddfrank act permits states to adopt stricter consumer protection laws and standards that are more stringent than those adopted at the federal level and in certain circumstances allows state attorneys general to enforce compliance with both the state and federal laws and regulations state regulation of financial products and potential enforcement actions could also adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

protection of customer personal information and cybersecurity 

the privacy provisions of glba generally prohibit financial institutions including us from disclosing nonpublic personal financial information of consumer customers to third parties for certain purposes primarily marketing unless customers have the opportunity to opt out of the disclosure the fair credit reporting act restricts information sharing among affiliates for marketing purposes both the fair credit reporting act and regulation v issued by the frb govern the use and provision of information to consumer reporting agencies 

the federal banking regulators regularly issue guidance regarding cybersecurity intended to enhance cyber risk management standards among financial institutions financial institutions are expected to design multiple layers of security controls to establish lines of defense and to ensure that their risk management processes also address the risk posed by compromised customer credentials including security measures to reliably authenticate customers’ accessing internetbased services of the financial institution further a financial institution’s management is expected to maintain sufficient business continuity planning processes to ensure the rapid recovery resumption and maintenance of the institution’s operations after a cyberattack involving destructive malware a financial institution is also expected to develop appropriate processes to enable recovery of data and business operations and address rebuilding network capabilities and restoring data if the institution or its critical service providers fall victim to this type of cyberattack if we fail to observe the regulatory guidance we could be subject to various regulatory sanctions including financial penalties for a further discussion of risks related to cybersecurity see item 1a “risk factors” 

in 2016 federal regulators jointly issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking on enhanced cyber risk management standards that are intended to increase the operational resilience of large and interconnected entities under their supervision once established the enhanced cyber risk management standards would help to reduce the potential impact of a cyberattack or other cyberrelated failure on the financial system the advance notice of proposed rulemaking addresses five categories of cyber standards 

i cyber risk governance 

ii cyber risk management 

iii internal dependency management 

iv external dependency management and 

v incident response cyber resilience and situational awareness 

we will continue to monitor any developments related to this proposed rulemaking 



state regulators have also been increasingly active in implementing privacy and cybersecurity standards and regulations recently several states have adopted laws and regulations requiring certain financial institutions to implement cybersecurity programs and providing detailed requirements with respect to these programs including data encryption requirements for example the california consumer privacy act which became effective on january 1 2020 gives new rights to california residents to require certain businesses to disclose or delete their personal information in addition many states have also recently implemented or modified their data breach notification and data privacy requirements we expect this trend of statelevel activity to continue and are continually monitoring developments in the states in which we operate 

community reinvestment act 

the cra requires banking regulators to evaluate the parent company and cbna in meeting the credit needs of our local communities including providing credit to individuals residing in low and moderate income neighborhoods the cra requires each appropriate federal bank regulatory agency in connection with its examination of a depository institution to assess such institution’s record in assessing and meeting the credit needs of the community served by that institution and assign ratings the regulatory agency’s evaluation of the institution’s record and ratings are made public these cra performance evaluations are also considered by regulatory agencies in evaluating mergers acquisitions and applications to open a branch or facility and in the case of a bank holding company that has elected financial holding company status a cra rating of at least “satisfactory” is required to commence certain new financial activities or to acquire a company engaged in such activities cbna received a rating of “outstanding” in our most recent cra evaluation 

on may 20 2020 the occ announced its final rule designed to strengthen and modernize its regulations under the cra which followed a december 2019 joint notice of proposed rulemaking with the fdic the final rule significantly revamps for national banks like cbna how the occ defines what qualifies for cra credit where such activity must be conducted to receive credit how cra performance is measured and how cra performance is documented and reported the final rule was effective october 1 2020 with a compliance date of january 1 2023 on november 24 2020 the occ issued a proposed rule which included its approach to determine and assess significant declines in cra evaluation measure benchmarks retail lending distribution test thresholds and community development minimums under the general performance standards set forth in the may 2020 final rule we will continue to evaluate the impact of any changes to the regulations implementing the cra 

compensation 

our compensation practices are subject to oversight by the frb and the occ the federal banking regulators have issued guidance designed to ensure that incentive compensation arrangements at banking organizations take into account risk and are consistent with safe and sound practices the guidance sets forth the following three key principles with respect to incentive compensation arrangements 

i the arrangements should provide employees with incentives that appropriately balance risk and financial results in a manner that does not encourage employees to expose their organizations to imprudent risk 

ii the arrangements should be compatible with effective controls and risk management and 

iii the arrangements should be supported by strong corporate governance 

the guidance provides that supervisory findings with respect to incentive compensation will be incorporated as appropriate into the organization’s supervisory ratings 

the us financial regulators including the frb the occ and the sec jointly proposed regulations in 2011 and again in 2016 to implement the incentive compensation requirements of section 956 of the doddfrank act these regulations have not been finalized 

antimoney laundering 

the usa patriot act enacted in 2001 and renewed in 2006 substantially broadened the scope of us antimoney laundering laws and regulations by imposing significant new compliance and due diligence obligations creating new crimes and penalties and expanding the extraterritorial jurisdiction of the united states institutions must maintain antimoney laundering programs that include established internal policies procedures and controls a designated compliance officer an ongoing employee training program and testing of the program by an independent audit function we are prohibited from entering into specified financial transactions and account relationships and must meet enhanced standards for due diligence in dealings with 



foreign financial institutions and foreign customers we also must take reasonable steps to conduct enhanced scrutiny of account relationships to guard against money laundering and to report any suspicious transactions recent laws provide law enforcement authorities with increased access to financial information maintained by banks 

the usa patriot act also provides for the facilitation of information sharing among governmental entities and financial institutions for the purpose of combating terrorism and money laundering the statute also creates enhanced information collection tools and enforcement mechanics for the us government including requiring standards for verifying customer identification at account opening promulgating rules to promote cooperation among financial institutions regulators and law enforcement entities in identifying parties that may be involved in terrorism or money laundering requiring reports by nonfinancial trades and businesses filed with the treasury’s financial crimes enforcement network “fincen” for transactions exceeding 10000 and mandating the filing of suspicious activities reports if a bank believes a customer may be violating us laws and regulations the statute also requires enhanced due diligence requirements for financial institutions that administer maintain or manage private bank accounts or correspondent accounts for nonus persons bank regulators routinely examine institutions for compliance with these obligations and are required to consider compliance in connection with the regulatory review of applications 

fincen drafts regulations implementing the usa patriot act and other antimoney laundering and bank secrecy act legislation fincen has adopted rules that require financial institutions to obtain beneficial ownership information with respect to legal entities with which such institutions conduct business subject to certain exclusions and exemptions bank regulators are focusing their examinations on antimoney laundering compliance and we continue to monitor and augment where necessary our antimoney laundering compliance programs 

office of foreign assets control regulation 

the us has imposed economic sanctions that affect transactions with designated foreign countries nationals and others these are typically known as the “ofac” rules based on their administration by the us treasury department office of foreign assets control the ofacadministered sanctions targeting countries take many different forms generally they contain one or more of the following elements 

i restrictions on trade with or investment in a sanctioned country including prohibitions against direct or indirect imports from and exports to a sanctioned country and prohibitions on us persons engaging in financial transactions relating to making investments in or providing investmentrelated advice or assistance to a sanctioned country and 

ii a blocking of assets in which the government or specially designated nationals of the sanctioned country have an interest by prohibiting transfers of property subject to us jurisdiction including property in the possession or control of us persons blocked assets eg property and bank deposits cannot be paid out withdrawn set off or transferred in any manner without a license from ofac 

ofac publishes and routinely updates lists of names of persons and organizations suspected of aiding harboring or engaging in terrorist acts including the specially designated nationals and blocked persons we are responsible for among other things blocking accounts of and transactions with such targets and countries prohibiting unlicensed trade and financial transactions with them and reporting blocked transactions after their occurrence if we find a name on any transaction account or wire transfer that is on an ofac list we must freeze such account file a suspicious activity report and notify the appropriate authorities failure to comply with these sanctions could have serious legal and reputational consequences 

regulation of brokerdealers 

our subsidiary ccmi is a registered brokerdealer with the sec and subject to regulation and examination by the sec as well as finra and other selfregulatory organizations these regulations cover a broad range of issues including capital requirements sales and trading practices use of client funds and securities the conduct of directors officers and employees recordkeeping and recording supervisory procedures to prevent improper trading on material nonpublic information qualification and licensing of sales personnel and limitations on the extension of credit in securities transactions in addition to federal registration state securities commissions require the registration of certain brokerdealers 



heightened risk governance standards 

cbna is subject to occ guidelines imposing heightened risk governance standards on large national banks with average total consolidated assets of 50 billion or more the guidelines set forth minimum standards for the design and implementation of a bank’s risk governance framework and minimum standards for oversight of that framework by a bank’s board of directors the guidelines are intended to protect the safety and soundness of covered banks and improve bank examiners’ ability to assess compliance with the occ’s expectations under the guidelines a bank may use its parent company’s risk governance framework if the framework meets the minimum standards the risk profiles of the parent company and the covered bank are substantially the same and certain other conditions are met cbna has elected to use the parent company’s risk governance framework a bank’s board of directors is required to have two members who are independent of the bank and parent company management a bank’s board of directors is responsible for ensuring that the risk governance framework meets the standards in the guidelines providing active oversight and a credible challenge to management’s recommendations and decisions and ensuring that the parent company decisions do not jeopardize the safety and soundness of the bank

 item 1a risk factors 

we are subject to a number of risks potentially impacting our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows as we are a financial services organization certain elements of risk are inherent in our transactions and operations and are present in the business decisions we make we therefore encounter risk as part of the normal course of our business and we design risk management processes to help manage these risks our success is dependent on our ability to identify understand and manage the risks presented by our business activities so that we can appropriately balance revenue generation and profitability these risks include but are not limited to credit risk market risk liquidity risk operational risk model risk technology regulatory and legal risk and strategic and reputational risk we discuss our principal risk management processes and in appropriate places related historical performance in the “risk governance” section in item 7 

you should carefully consider the following risk factors that may affect our business financial condition and results of operations other factors that could affect our business financial condition and results of operation are discussed in the “forwardlooking statements” section above however there may be additional risks that are not presently material or known and factors besides those discussed below or in this or other reports that we file or furnish with the sec that could also adversely affect us 

risks related to our business 

the covid19 pandemic and associated lockdowns have adversely affected us and may continue to adversely affect and created and may exacerbate or create new significant risks and uncertainties for our business and the ultimate impact of the pandemic on us will depend on future developments which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted 

the covid19 pandemic and associated lockdowns have negatively affected the global and us economies increased unemployment levels disrupted supply chains and businesses in many industries lowered equity market valuations decreased liquidity in fixed income markets and created significant volatility and disruption in financial markets this has resulted and could continue to result in higher and more volatile provisions for credit losses and is also expected to result in increased chargeoffs particularly as more 



customers experience credit deterioration and as customers need to draw on their committed credit lines to help finance their businesses and activities the pandemic’s negative economic impact and its effect on customer needs and behaviors could adversely affect our liquidity and also continue to adversely affect our capital profile moreover governmental actions in response to the pandemic are meaningfully influencing the interestrate environment which has and is likely to continue to reduce our net interest margin the pandemic may also have adverse effects on our noninterest income the effects of the pandemic have resulted and may continue to result in lower service charges and fees and card fees and has also caused and may continue to cause volatility in other noninterest income in particular capital markets fees and foreign exchange and interest rate products revenue 

in addition our reliance on workfromhome capabilities and the potential inability to maintain critical staff in our operational facilities present risks associated with our local infrastructure restrictive stayathome orders across jurisdictions illness quarantines and the sustainability of a workfromhome environment as well as heightened cybersecurity information security and operational risks many of our service providers have been and may further be affected by similar factors that increase their risk of business disruptions or that may otherwise affect their ability to perform under the terms of any agreements with us or provide essential services any disruption to our ability to deliver financial products or services to or interact with our clients and customers could result in losses or increased operational costs regulatory fines penalties or other sanctions or harm to our reputation we also face an increased risk of litigation and governmental and regulatory scrutiny as a result of the effects of the pandemic on market and economic conditions and the actions of governmental authorities in response to those conditions 

the federal banking regulators have issued interagency guidance to clarify supervisory expectations regarding loan modifications due to covid19related nonpayment and the regulatory capital transition for the current expected credit loss accounting standard further the federal reserve has implemented a broad array of actions to limit the negative impacts of the covid19 pandemic and associated lockdowns on the economy and us businesses in addition the us congress has passed a number of economic stimulus packages including the 2 trillion cares act the families first coronavirus response act the coronavirus preparedness and response supplemental appropriations act 2020 and the consolidated appropriations act 2021 in response to the pandemic we have i assisted our retail and small business customers through loan forbearances and modifications ii extended loans under the ppp and iii committed funding for community support with a particular emphasis on small businesses and nonprofit partners these government programs are complex and our participation may lead to governmental and regulatory scrutiny negative publicity and damage to our reputation 

in april 2020 we announced that we would temporarily suspend our stock repurchase program through december 31 2020 to support the efforts of the federal reserve and other banks to moderate the impact of the pandemic by making additional capital and liquidity available to our customers including corporates small businesses and individuals further the federal reserve took actions to preserve capital at banks by imposing certain limitations on firms that participate in ccar for the third and fourth quarters of 2020 including mandatory suspension of share repurchases and limiting common stock dividends to existing rates and the average quarterly net income for the prior four quarters in december 2020 the federal reserve modified its limitations on capital distributions for the first quarter of 2021 such that firms that participate in ccar like us may resume share repurchases provided that the aggregate of share repurchases and common stock dividends for the first quarter of 2021 do not exceed average quarterly net income for the trailing four quarters the federal reserve can extend or modify its current capital distribution limitations in future quarters the pandemic may cause us to limit future capital distributions 

the extent to which the pandemic and associated lockdowns adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations as well as our liquidity and regulatory capital ratios will depend on future developments which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted including the scope and duration of the pandemic the widespread availability use and effectiveness of vaccines the effectiveness of our workfromhome arrangements and staffing levels in operational facilities actions taken by governmental authorities and other third parties in response to the pandemic and associated lockdowns and the direct and indirect impact of the pandemic and associated lockdowns on us our clients and customers our service providers and other market participants as the pandemic and associated lockdowns adversely affect us it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described herein 



we may not be able to successfully execute our business strategy 

our business strategy is designed to maximize the full potential of our business and drive sustainable growth and enhanced profitability and our success rests on our ability to maintain a highperforming customercentric organization develop differentiated value propositions to acquire deepen and retain core customer segments build excellent capabilities designed to help us stand out from our competitors operate with financial discipline and a mindset of continuous improvement to selffund investments prudently grow and optimize our balance sheet modernize our technology and operational models to improve delivery organizational agility and speed to market and embed risk management within our culture and our operations our future success and the value of our stock will depend in part on our ability to effectively implement our business strategy there are risks and uncertainties many of which are not within our control associated with each element of our strategy if we are not able to successfully execute our business strategy we may never achieve our financial performance goals and any shortfall may be material see the “business strategy” section in item 1 for further information 

supervisory requirements and expectations on us as a financial holding company and a bank holding company and any regulatorimposed limits on our activities could adversely affect our ability to implement our strategic plan expand our business continue to improve our financial performance and make capital distributions to our stockholders 

our operations are subject to extensive regulation supervision and examination by the federal banking agencies the frb the occ and the fdic as well as the cfpb as part of the supervisory and examination process if we are unsuccessful in meeting the supervisory requirements and expectations that apply to us regulatory agencies may from time to time take supervisory actions against us that may not be publicly disclosed such actions may include restrictions on our activities or the activities of our subsidiaries informal nonpublic or formal public supervisory actions or public enforcement actions including the payment of civil money penalties which could increase our costs and limit our ability to implement our strategic plans and expand our business and as a result could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations see the “regulation and supervision” section in item 1 for further information 

changes in interest rates may have an adverse effect on our profitability 

net interest income historically has been and we anticipate that it will remain a significant component of our total revenue this is due to the fact that a high percentage of our assets and liabilities have been and will likely continue to be in the form of interestbearing or interestrelated instruments changes in interest rates can have a material effect on many areas of our business including net interest income deposit costs loan volume and delinquency and the value of our mortgage servicing rights interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond our control including general economic conditions and policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies and in particular the federal open market committee changes in monetary policy including changes in interest rates could influence not only the interest we receive on loans and securities and the amount of interest we pay on deposits and borrowings but such changes could also affect our ability to originate loans and obtain deposits and the fair value of our financial assets and liabilities if the interest rates on our interestbearing liabilities increase at a faster pace than the interest rates on our interest earning assets our net interest income may decline and with it a decline in our earnings may occur our net interest income and our earnings would be similarly affected if the interest rates on our interest earning assets declined at a faster pace than the interest rates on our interestbearing liabilities 

we cannot control or predict with certainty changes in interest rates global national regional and local economic conditions competitive pressures and the policies of regulatory authorities including monetary policies of the frb affect interest income and interest expense although we have policies and procedures designed to manage the risks associated with changes in market interest rates as further discussed under the “risk governance” section in item 7 changes in interest rates still may have an adverse effect on our profitability 

if our ongoing assumptions regarding borrower or depositor behavior or overall economic conditions are significantly different than we anticipate then our risk mitigation may be insufficient to protect against interest rate risk and our net income would be adversely affected 



changes in the method pursuant to which the libor and other benchmark rates are calculated and their planned discontinuance could adversely impact our business operations and financial results 

many of our lending products securities derivatives and other financial transactions utilize a benchmark rate such as libor to determine the applicable interest rate or payment amount in 2017 the chief executive of the uk financial conduct authority “fca” announced that the fca intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of libor after 2021 since then the financial industry has been working towards the transition away from libor to alternative reference rates on november 30 2020 the ice benchmark administration “iba” the authorized administrator of libor regulated by the uk fca announced a proposal that if adopted would result in the cessation of oneweek and twomonth us dollar libor as previously anticipated at the end of 2021 while extending the publication of the other tenors of us dollar libor until june 30 2023 while this proposal has received support from both uk and us regulators the us regulators are encouraging banks to stop entering into new us dollar libor contracts as soon as practicable and not later than december 31 2021 the combination of the iba proposal and the us official sector guidance would continue to facilitate the transition away from libor for new originations by the end of 2021 while enabling more legacy contracts to mature before the final libor cessation date of june 30 2023 

the discontinuation of a benchmark rate changes in a benchmark rate or changes in market perceptions of the acceptability of a benchmark rate including libor could among other things adversely affect the value of and return on certain of our financial instruments or products result in changes to our risk exposures or require renegotiation of previous transactions in addition any such discontinuation or changes whether actual or anticipated could result in market volatility adverse tax or accounting effects increased compliance legal and operational costs and risks associated with customer disclosures and contract negotiations the transition to using a new rate could also expose us to risks associated with disputes with customers and other market participants in connection with interpreting and implementing libor fallback provisions 

in 2018 we formed a libor transition program designed to guide the organization through the planned discontinuation of libor various regulators industry bodies and other market participants in the us and other countries are engaged in initiatives to develop introduce and encourage the use of alternative rates to replace certain benchmarks despite progress made to date by regulators and industry participants such as us to prepare for the anticipated discontinuation of libor significant uncertainties still remain such uncertainties relate to for example whether replacement benchmark rates may become accepted alternatives to libor for different types of transactions and financial instruments how the terms of any transaction or financial instrument may be adjusted to account for differences between libor and any alternative rate selected how any replacement would be implemented across the industry and the effect any changes in industry views or movement to alternative benchmarks would have on the markets for liborlinked financial instruments 

we could fail to attract retain or motivate highly skilled and qualified personnel including our senior management other key employees or members of our board which could impair our ability to successfully execute our strategic plan and otherwise adversely affect our business 

a cornerstone of our strategic plan involves the hiring of highly skilled and qualified personnel accordingly our ability to implement our strategic plan and our future success depends on our ability to attract retain and motivate highly skilled and qualified personnel including our senior management and other key employees and directors the marketplace for skilled personnel is becoming more competitive which means the cost of hiring incentivizing and retaining skilled personnel may continue to increase the failure to attract or retain including as a result of an untimely death or illness of key personnel or replace a sufficient number of appropriately skilled and key personnel could place us at a significant competitive disadvantage and prevent us from successfully implementing our strategy which could impair our ability to implement our strategic plan successfully achieve our performance targets and otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

limitations on the manner in which regulated financial institutions such as us can compensate their officers and employees including those contained in pending rule proposals implementing requirements of section 956 of the doddfrank act may make it more difficult for such institutions to compete for talent with financial institutions and other companies not subject to these or similar limitations if we are unable to compete effectively our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected perhaps materially 



our ability to meet our obligations and the cost of funds to do so depend on our ability to access identified sources of liquidity at a reasonable cost 

liquidity risk is the risk that we will not be able to meet our obligations including funding commitments as they come due this risk is inherent in our operations and can be heightened by a number of factors including an overreliance on a particular source of funding including for example secured fhlb advances changes in credit ratings or marketwide phenomena such as market dislocation and major disasters like many banking groups our reliance on customer deposits to meet a considerable portion of our funding has grown over recent years and we continue to seek to increase the proportion of our funding represented by customer deposits however these deposits are subject to fluctuation due to certain factors outside our control such as increasing competitive pressures for retail or corporate customer deposits changes in interest rates and returns on other investment classes or a loss of confidence by customers in us or in the banking sector generally which could result in a significant outflow of deposits within a short period of time to the extent there is heightened competition among us banks for retail customer deposits this competition may increase the cost of procuring new deposits andor retaining existing deposits and otherwise negatively affect our ability to grow our deposit base an inability to grow or any material decrease in our deposits could have a material adverse effect on our ability to satisfy our liquidity needs 

maintaining a diverse and appropriate funding strategy for our assets consistent with our wider strategic risk appetite and plan remains challenging and any tightening of credit markets could have a material adverse impact on us in particular there is a risk that corporate and financial institution counterparties may seek to reduce their credit exposures to banks and other financial institutions for example reductions in unsecured deposits supplied by these counterparties which may cause funding from these sources to no longer be available under these circumstances we may need to seek funds from alternative sources potentially at higher costs than has previously been the case or may be required to consider disposals of other assets not previously identified for disposal in order to reduce our funding commitments 

a reduction in our credit ratings which are based on a number of factors could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

credit ratings affect the cost and other terms upon which we are able to obtain funding rating agencies regularly evaluate us and their ratings are based on a number of factors including our financial strength other factors considered by rating agencies include conditions affecting the financial services industry generally any downgrade in our ratings would likely increase our borrowing costs could limit our access to capital markets and otherwise adversely affect our business for example a ratings downgrade could adversely affect our ability to sell or market certain of our securities including longterm debt engage in certain longerterm derivatives transactions and retain our customers particularly corporate customers who may require a minimum rating threshold in order to place funds with us in addition under the terms of certain of our derivatives contracts we may be required to maintain a minimum credit rating or have to post additional collateral or terminate such contracts any of these results of a rating downgrade could increase our cost of funding reduce our liquidity and have adverse effects on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our financial performance may be adversely affected by deterioration in borrower credit quality particularly in the new england midatlantic and midwest regions where our operations are concentrated 

we have exposure to many different industries and risks arising from actual or perceived changes in credit quality and uncertainty over the recoverability of amounts due from borrowers is inherent in our businesses our exposure may be exacerbated by the geographic concentration of our operations which are predominately located in the new england midatlantic and midwest regions the credit quality of our borrowers may deteriorate for a number of reasons that are outside our control including as a result of prevailing economic and market conditions and asset valuation the trends and risks affecting borrower credit quality particularly in the new england midatlantic and midwest regions have caused and in the future may cause us to experience impairment charges increased repurchase demands higher costs additional writedowns and losses and an inability to engage in routine funding transactions which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 



our framework for managing risks may not be effective in mitigating risk and loss 

our risk management framework is made up of various processes and strategies to manage our risk exposure the framework to manage risk including the framework’s underlying assumptions may not be effective under all conditions and circumstances if the risk management framework proves ineffective we could suffer unexpected losses and could be materially adversely affected 

one of the main types of risks inherent in our business is credit risk an important feature of our credit risk management system is to employ an internal credit risk control system through which we identify measure monitor and mitigate existing and emerging credit risk of our customers as this process involves detailed analyses of the customer or credit risk taking into account both quantitative and qualitative factors it is subject to human error in exercising their judgment our employees may not always be able to assign an accurate credit rating to a customer or credit risk which may result in our exposure to higher credit risks than indicated by our risk rating system 

in addition we have undertaken certain actions to enhance our credit policies and guidelines to address potential risks associated with particular industries or types of customers as discussed in more detail under the “risk governance” and “market risk” sections in item 7 however we may not be able to effectively implement these initiatives or consistently follow and refine our credit risk management system if any of the foregoing were to occur it may result in an increase in the level of nonperforming loans and a higher risk exposure for us which could have a material adverse effect on us 

changes in our accounting policies or in accounting standards could materially affect how we report our financial results and condition 

from time to time the fasb and sec change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of our financial statements these changes can be operationally complex to implement and can materially impact how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations for example in june 2016 the fasb issued accounting standards update 201613 measurement of credit losses on financial instruments “cecl” that substantially changed the accounting for credit losses on loans and other financial assets held by banks financial institutions and other organizations upon adoption of cecl on january 1 2020 we recognize credit losses on these assets equal to management’s estimate of credit losses over the full remaining expected life we consider all relevant information when estimating expected credit losses including details about past events current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts as evidenced in the first half of 2020 due to the impact of covid19 the standard introduces heightened volatility in provision for credit losses given uncertainty in the accuracy of macroeconomic forecasts over longer time horizons variances in the rate and composition of loan growth and changes in overall loan portfolio size and mix as a result it is possible that our ongoing reported earnings and lending activity could be negatively impacted for more information regarding cecl see note 1 in item 8 

our financial and accounting estimates and risk management framework rely on analytical forecasting and models 

the processes we use to estimate our inherent loan losses and to measure the fair value of financial instruments as well as the processes used to estimate the effects of changing interest rates and other market measures on our financial condition and results of operations depends upon the use of analytical and forecasting models some of our tools and metrics for managing risk are based upon our use of observed historical market behavior we rely on quantitative models to measure risks and to estimate certain financial values models may be used in such processes as determining the pricing of various products grading loans and extending credit measuring interest rate and other market risks predicting losses assessing capital adequacy and calculating regulatory capital levels as well as estimating the value of financial instruments and balance sheet items poorly designed or implemented models present the risk that our business decisions based on information incorporating such models will be adversely affected due to the inadequacy of that information moreover our models may fail to predict future risk exposures if the information used in the model is incorrect obsolete or not sufficiently comparable to actual events as they occur we seek to incorporate appropriate historical data in our models but the range of market values and behaviors reflected in any period of historical data is not at all times predictive of future developments in any particular period and the period of data we incorporate into our models may turn out to be inappropriate for the future period being modeled in such case our ability to manage risk would be limited and our risk exposure and losses could be significantly greater than our models indicated in addition if existing or potential customers believe our risk management is inadequate they could take their business elsewhere this could harm our reputation as well as our revenues and profits finally information we provide to 



our regulators based on poorly designed or implemented models could also be inaccurate or misleading some of the decisions that our regulators make including those related to capital distributions to our stockholders could be adversely affected due to their perception that the quality of the models used to generate the relevant information is insufficient 

the preparation of our financial statements requires the use of estimates that may vary from actual results particularly various factors may cause our allowance for credit losses to increase 

the preparation of audited consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make significant estimates that affect the financial statements our most critical accounting estimate is the acl the acl is a reserve established through a provision for credit losses charged to expense and represents our estimate of expected credit losses within the existing loan and lease portfolio and unfunded lending commitments the level of the acl is based on periodic evaluation of the loan and lease portfolios and unfunded lending commitments that are not unconditionally cancellable considering a number of relevant underlying factors including key assumptions and evaluation of quantitative and qualitative information 

the determination of the appropriate level of the acl inherently involves a degree of subjectivity and requires that we make significant estimates of current credit risks and future trends all of which may undergo material changes changes in economic conditions affecting borrowers the stagnation of certain economic indicators that we are more susceptible to such as unemployment and real estate values new information regarding existing loans identification of additional problem loans and other factors both within and outside our control may require an increase in the acl in addition bank regulatory agencies periodically review our acl and may require an increase in the acl or the recognition of further loan chargeoffs based on judgments that can differ from those of our own management in addition if chargeoffs in future periods exceed the acl—that is if the acl is inadequate—we will need to recognize additional provision for credit losses should such additional provision expense become necessary it would result in a decrease in net income and capital and may have a material adverse effect on us for more information regarding our use of estimates in preparation of financial statements see note 1 in item 8 and the “critical accounting estimates” section in item 7 

operational risks are inherent in our businesses 

our operations depend on our ability to process a very large number of transactions efficiently and accurately while complying with applicable laws and regulations operational risk and losses can result from internal and external fraud improper conduct or errors by employees or third parties failure to document transactions properly or to obtain proper authorization failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements and conduct of business rules equipment failures including those caused by natural disasters or by electrical telecommunications or other essential utility outages business continuity and data security system failures including those caused by computer viruses cyberattacks against us or our vendors or unforeseen problems encountered while implementing major new computer systems or upgrades to existing systems or the inadequacy or failure of systems and controls including those of our suppliers or counterparties although we have implemented risk controls and loss mitigation actions and substantial resources are devoted to developing efficient procedures identifying and rectifying weaknesses in existing procedures and training staff it is not possible to be certain that such actions have been or will be effective in controlling each of the operational risks faced by us any weakness in these systems or controls or any breaches or alleged breaches of such laws or regulations could result in increased regulatory supervision enforcement actions and other disciplinary action and have an adverse impact on our business applicable authorizations and licenses reputation and results of operations 

the financial services industry including the banking sector is undergoing rapid technological change as a result of changes in customer behavior competition and changes in the legal and regulatory framework and we may not be able to compete effectively as a result of these changes 

the financial services industry including the banking sector is continually undergoing rapid technological change with frequent introductions of new technologydriven products and services in addition new unexpected technological changes could have a disruptive effect on the way banks offer products and services we believe our success depends to a great extent on our ability to address customer needs by using technology to offer products and services that provide convenience to customers and to create additional efficiencies in our operations however we may not be able to among other things keep up with the rapid pace of technological changes effectively implement new technologydriven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to our customers as a result our ability to compete effectively to attract 



or retain new business may be impaired and our business financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected 

in addition changes in the legal and regulatory framework under which we operate require us to update our information systems to ensure compliance our need to review and evaluate the impact of ongoing rule proposals final rules and implementation guidance from regulators further complicates the development and implementation of new information systems for our business also recent regulatory guidance has focused on the need for financial institutions to perform increased due diligence and ongoing monitoring of thirdparty vendor relationships thus increasing the scope of management involvement and decreasing the efficiency otherwise resulting from our relationships with thirdparty technology providers given the significant number of ongoing regulatory reform initiatives it is possible that we incur higher than expected information technology costs in order to comply with current and impending regulations see “—supervisory requirements and expectations on us as a financial holding company and a bank holding company and any regulatorimposed limits on our activities could adversely affect our ability to implement our strategic plan expand our business continue to improve our financial performance and make capital distributions to our stockholders” 

we are subject to a variety of cybersecurity risks that if realized could adversely affect how we conduct our business 

information security risks for large financial institutions such as us have increased significantly in recent years in part because of the proliferation of new technologies such as internet and mobile banking to conduct financial transactions and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime hackers terrorists nationstates activists and other external parties third parties with whom we or our customers do business also present operational and information security risks to us including security breaches or failures of their own systems the possibility of employee error failure to follow security procedures or malfeasance also presents these risks particularly given the recent trend towards remote work arrangements our operations rely on the secure processing transmission and storage of confidential information in our computer systems and networks in addition to access our products and services our customers may use personal computers smartphones tablets and other mobile devices that are beyond our control environment although we believe that we have appropriate information security procedures and controls our technologies systems networks and our customers’ devices may be the target of cyberattacks or information security breaches that could result in the unauthorized release gathering monitoring misuse theft sale or loss or destruction of the confidential andor proprietary information of cfg our customers our vendors our counterparties or our employees we are under continuous threat of loss or network degradation due to cyberattacks such as computer viruses malicious or destructive code phishing attacks ransomware and distributed denial of service “ddos” attacks this is especially true as we continue to expand customer capabilities to utilize the internet and other remote channels to transact business two of the most significant cyberattack risks that we face are efraud and loss of sensitive customer data loss from efraud occurs when cybercriminals extract funds directly from customers’ or our accounts using fraudulent schemes that may include internetbased funds transfers we have been subject to a number of efraud incidents historically we have also been subject to attempts to steal sensitive customer data such as account numbers and social security numbers through unauthorized access to our computer systems including computer hacking such attacks are less frequent but could present significant reputational legal and regulatory costs to us if successful we have implemented certain technology protections such as customer profiling and setup authentication to be in compliance with the ffiec authentication in internet banking environment “aibe” guidelines 

as cyber threats continue to evolve we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our layers of defense or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities system enhancements and updates may also create risks associated with implementing new systems and integrating them with existing ones due to the complexity and interconnectedness of information technology systems the process of enhancing our layers of defense can itself create a risk of systems disruptions and security issues in addition addressing certain information security vulnerabilities such as hardwarebased vulnerabilities may affect the performance of our information technology systems the ability of our hardware and software providers to deliver patches and updates to mitigate vulnerabilities in a timely manner can introduce additional risks particularly when a vulnerability is being actively exploited by threat actors cyberattacks against the patches themselves have also proven to be a significant risk that companies will have to address going forward 



despite our efforts to prevent a cyberattack a successful cyberattack could persist for an extended period of time before being detected and following detection it could take considerable time for us to obtain full and reliable information about the cybersecurity incident and the extent amount and type of information compromised during the course of an investigation we may not necessarily know the full effects of the incident or how to remediate it and actions and decisions that are taken or made in an effort to mitigate risk may further increase the costs and other negative consequences of the incident 

the techniques used by cyber criminals change frequently may not be recognized until launched and can be initiated from a variety of sources including terrorist organizations and hostile foreign governments these actors may attempt to fraudulently induce employees customers or other users of our systems to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to data or our systems in the event that a cyberattack is successful our business financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected for a discussion of the guidance that federal banking regulators have released regarding cybersecurity and cyber risk management standards see the “regulation and supervision” section of item 1 

we rely heavily on communications and information systems to conduct our business 

we rely heavily on communications and information systems to conduct our business any failure interruption or breach in security of these systems including due to hacking or other similar attempts to breach information technology security protocols could result in failures or disruptions in our customer relationship management general ledger deposit loan and other systems although we have established policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the effect of the possible failure interruption or security breach of our information systems there can be no assurance that these policies and procedures will be successful and that any such failure interruption or security breach will not occur or if they do occur that they will be adequately addressed the occurrence of any failure interruption or security breach of our information systems could require us to devote substantial resources including management time and attention to recovery and response efforts damage our reputation result in a loss of customer business subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny or expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability although we maintain insurance coverage for information security events we may incur losses as a result of such events that are not insured against or not fully covered by our insurance 

we rely on third parties for the performance of a significant portion of our information technology 

we rely on third parties for the performance of a significant portion of our information technology functions and the provision of information technology and business process services for example i unaffiliated third parties operate data communications networks on which certain components and services relating to our online banking system rely ii third parties host or maintain many of our applications including our commercial loan system which is hosted and maintained by automated financial systems inc and our mobile digital banking application which is hosted and maintained by amazon web services inc iii fidelity national information services inc maintains our core deposits system iv infosys limited provides us with a wide range of information technology support services including service desk end user servicer and private cloud support and v ibm corporation provides us with mainframe support services the success of our business depends in part on the continuing ability of these and other third parties to perform these functions and services in a timely and satisfactory manner which performance could be disrupted or otherwise adversely affected due to failures or other information security events originating at the third parties or at the third parties’ suppliers or vendors socalled “fourth party risk” we may not be able to effectively monitor or mitigate fourthparty risk in particular as it relates to the use of common suppliers or vendors by the third parties that perform functions and services for us if we experience a disruption in the provision of any functions or services performed by third parties we may have difficulty in finding alternate providers on terms favorable to us and in reasonable time frames if these services are not performed in a satisfactory manner we would not be able to serve our customers well in either situation our business could incur significant costs and be adversely affected 

we are exposed to reputational risk and the risk of damage to our brands and the brands of our affiliates 

our success and results depend in part on our reputation and the strength of our brands we are vulnerable to adverse market perception as we operate in an industry where integrity customer trust and confidence are paramount we are exposed to the risk that litigation employee misconduct operational failures the outcome of regulatory or other investigations or actions press speculation and negative publicity among other factors could damage our brands or reputation our brands and reputation could also be harmed if we sell 



products or services that do not perform as expected or customers’ expectations for the product are not satisfied 

we may be adversely affected by unpredictable catastrophic events or terrorist attacks and our business continuity and disaster recovery plans may not adequately protect us from serious disaster 

the occurrence of catastrophic events such as hurricanes tropical storms tornadoes and other largescale catastrophes and terrorist attacks could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations if a catastrophe rendered both our production data center in rhode island and our recovery data center in north carolina unusable although we enhanced our disaster recovery capabilities in 2016 through the completion of the new outofregion backup data center in north carolina there can be no assurance that our current disaster recovery plans and capabilities will adequately protect us from serious disaster 

risks related to our industry 

any deterioration in national economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our business is affected by national economic conditions as well as perceptions of those conditions and future economic prospects changes in such economic conditions are not predictable and cannot be controlled adverse economic conditions could require us to charge off a higher percentage of loans and increase the provision for credit losses which would reduce our net income and otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations for example our business was significantly affected by the global economic and financial crisis that began in 2008 the falling home prices increased rate of foreclosure and high levels of unemployment in the united states triggered significant writedowns by us and other financial institutions these writedowns adversely impacted our financial results in material respects although the us economy has made a significant recovery an interruption or reversal of this recovery would adversely affect the financial services industry and banking sector 

we operate in an industry that is highly competitive which could result in losing business or margin declines and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we operate in a highly competitive industry the industry could become even more competitive as a result of reform of the financial services industry resulting from the doddfrank act and other legislative regulatory and technological changes as well as continued consolidation we face aggressive competition from other domestic and foreign lending institutions and from numerous other providers of financial services including nonbanking financial institutions that are not subject to the same regulatory restrictions as banks and bank holding companies securities firms and insurance companies and competitors that may have greater financial resources 

with respect to nonbanking financial institutions technology and other changes have lowered barriers to entry and made it possible for nonbanks to offer products and services traditionally provided by banks for example consumers can maintain funds that would have historically been held as bank deposits in brokerage accounts or mutual funds consumers can also complete transactions such as paying bills andor transferring funds directly without the assistance of banks the process of eliminating banks as intermediaries known as “disintermediation” could result in the loss of fee income as well as the loss of customer deposits and the related income generated from those deposits some of our nonbank competitors are not subject to the same extensive regulations we are and therefore may have greater flexibility in competing for business as a result of these and other sources of competition we could lose business to competitors or be forced to price products and services on less advantageous terms to retain or attract clients either of which would adversely affect our profitability 

the conditions of other financial institutions or of the financial services industry could adversely affect our operations and financial conditions 

financial services institutions are typically interconnected as a result of trading investment liquidity management clearing counterparty and other relationships within the financial services industry the default by any one institution could lead to defaults by other institutions concerns about or a default by one institution could lead to significant liquidity problems and losses or defaults by other institutions as the commercial and financial soundness of many financial institutions are closely related as a result of these credit trading clearing and other relationships even the perceived lack of creditworthiness of or questions about a 



counterparty may lead to marketwide liquidity problems and losses or defaults by various institutions this systemic risk may adversely affect financial intermediaries such as clearing agencies banks and exchanges with which we interact on a daily basis or key funding providers such as the fhlbs any of which could have a material adverse effect on our access to liquidity or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

risks related to regulations governing our industry 

as a financial holding company and a bank holding company we are subject to comprehensive regulation that could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

as a financial holding company and a bank holding company we are subject to comprehensive regulation supervision and examination by the frb in addition cbna is subject to comprehensive regulation supervision and examination by the occ our regulators supervise us through regular examinations and other means that allow the regulators to gauge management’s ability to identify assess and control risk in all areas of operations in a safe and sound manner and to ensure compliance with laws and regulations in the course of their supervision and examinations our regulators may require improvements in various areas if we are unable to implement and maintain any required actions in a timely and effective manner we could become subject to informal nonpublic or formal public supervisory actions and public enforcement orders that could lead to significant restrictions on our existing business or on our ability to engage in any new business such forms of supervisory action could include without limitation written agreements cease and desist orders and consent orders and may among other things result in restrictions on our ability to pay dividends requirements to increase capital restrictions on our activities the imposition of civil monetary penalties and enforcement of such actions through injunctions or restraining orders we could also be required to dispose of certain assets and liabilities within a prescribed period the terms of any such supervisory or enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are a bank holding company that has elected to become a financial holding company pursuant to the bank holding company act financial holding companies are allowed to engage in certain financial activities in which a bank holding company is not otherwise permitted to engage however to maintain financial holding company status a bank holding company and all of its depository institution subsidiaries must be “well capitalized” and “well managed” if a bank holding company ceases to meet these capital and management requirements there are many penalties it would be faced with including the frb may impose limitations or conditions on the conduct of its activities and it may not undertake any of the broader financial activities permissible for financial holding companies or acquire a company engaged in such financial activities without prior approval of the frb if a company does not return to compliance within 180 days which period may be extended the frb may require divestiture of that company’s depository institutions to the extent we do not meet the requirements to be a financial holding company in the future there could be a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we may be unable to disclose some restrictions or limitations on our operations imposed by our regulators 

from time to time bank regulatory agencies take supervisory actions that restrict or limit a financial institution’s activities and lead it to raise capital or subject it to other requirements directives issued to enforce such actions may be confidential and thus in some instances we are not permitted to publicly disclose these actions in addition as part of our regular examination process our regulators may advise us to operate under various restrictions as a prudential matter any such actions or restrictions if and in whatever manner imposed could adversely affect our costs and revenues moreover efforts to comply with any such nonpublic supervisory actions or restrictions may require material investments in additional resources and systems as well as a significant commitment of managerial time and attention as a result such supervisory actions or restrictions if and in whatever manner imposed could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations and in certain instances we may not be able to publicly disclose these matters 

the regulatory environment in which we operate continues to be subject to significant and evolving regulatory requirements that could have a material adverse effect on our business and earnings 

we are heavily regulated by multiple banking consumer protection securities and other regulatory authorities at the federal and state levels this regulatory oversight is primarily established to protect depositors the fdic’s deposit insurance fund consumers of financial products and the financial system as a 



whole not our security holders changes to statutes regulations rules or policies including the interpretation implementation or enforcement of statutes regulations rules or policies could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways including by for example subjecting us to additional costs limiting the types of financial services and other products we may offer limiting our ability to pursue acquisitions and increasing the ability of third parties including nonbanks to offer competing financial services and products in recent years we together with the rest of the financial services industry have faced particularly intense scrutiny with many new regulatory initiatives and vigorous oversight and enforcement on the part of numerous regulatory and governmental authorities legislatures and regulators have pursued a broad array of initiatives intended to promote the safety and soundness of financial institutions financial market stability the transparency and liquidity of financial markets and consumer and investor protection certain regulators and law enforcement authorities have also recently required admissions of wrongdoing and in some cases criminal pleas as part of the resolutions of matters brought by them against financial institutions any such resolution of a matter involving us could lead to increased exposure to civil litigation could adversely affect our reputation could result in penalties or limitations on our ability to do business or engage in certain activities and could have other negative effects in addition a single event or issue may give rise to numerous and overlapping investigations and proceedings including by multiple federal and state regulators and other governmental authorities 

we are also subject to laws and regulations relating to the privacy of the information of our customers employees counterparties and others and any failure to comply with these laws and regulations could expose us to liability andor reputational damage as new privacyrelated laws and regulations are implemented the time and resources needed for us to comply with those laws and regulations as well as our potential liability for noncompliance and our reporting obligations in the case of data breaches may significantly increase 

while there have been significant revisions to the laws and regulations applicable to us that have been finalized in recent months there are other rules to implement changes that have yet to be proposed or enacted by our regulators the final timing scope and impact of these changes to the regulatory framework applicable to financial institutions remains uncertain for more information on the regulations to which we are subject and recent initiatives to reform financial institution regulation see the “regulation and supervision” section in item 1 

we are subject to capital adequacy and liquidity standards and if we fail to meet these standards our financial condition and operations would be adversely affected 

we are subject to several capital adequacy and liquidity standards to the extent that we are unable to meet these standards our ability to make distributions of capital will be limited and we may be subject to additional supervisory actions and limitations on our activities see “regulation and supervision” in item 1 and the “capital and regulatory requirements” and “liquidity” sections in item 7 for further discussion of the regulations to which we are subject 

the parent company could be required to act as a “source of strength” to cbna which would have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

frb policy historically required bank holding companies to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to their subsidiary banks the doddfrank act codified this policy as a statutory requirement this support may be required by the frb at times when we might otherwise determine not to provide it or when doing so is not otherwise in the interests of cfg or our stockholders or creditors and may include one or more of the following 

• the parent company may be compelled to contribute capital to cbna including by engaging in a public offering to raise such capital furthermore any extensions of credit from the parent company to cbna that are included in cbna’s capital would be subordinate in right of payment to depositors and certain other indebtedness of cbna 

• in the event of a bank holding company’s bankruptcy any commitment that the bank holding company had been required to make to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to priority of payment 

• in the event of impairment of the capital stock of cbna the parent company as cbna’s stockholder could be required to pay such deficiency 



the parent company depends on cbna for substantially all of its revenue and restrictions on dividends and other distributions by cbna could affect its liquidity and ability to fulfill our obligations 

as a bank holding company the parent company is a separate and distinct legal entity from cbna our banking subsidiary the parent company typically receives substantially all of our revenue from dividends from cbna these dividends are the principal source of funds to pay dividends on our equity and interest and principal on our debt various federal andor state laws and regulations as well as regulatory expectations limit the amount of dividends that cbna may pay to the parent company also our right to participate in a distribution of assets upon a subsidiary’s liquidation or reorganization is subject to the prior claims of the subsidiary’s creditors in the event cbna is unable to pay dividends to the parent company it may not be able to service debt pay obligations or pay dividends on its common stock the inability to receive dividends from cbna could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations see the “supervision and regulation” section in item 1 and the “capital and regulatory matters” section in item 7 

from timetotime we may become or are subject to regulatory actions that may have a material impact on our business 

we may become or are involved from time to time in reviews investigations and proceedings both formal and informal by governmental and selfregulatory agencies regarding our business these regulatory actions involve among other matters accounting compliance and operational matters certain of which may result in adverse judgments settlements fines penalties injunctions or other relief that may require changes to our business or otherwise materially impact our business 

in regulatory actions such as those referred to above it is inherently difficult to determine whether any loss is probable or whether it is possible to reasonably estimate the amount of any loss we cannot predict with certainty if how or when such proceedings will be resolved or what the eventual fine penalty or other relief conditions or restrictions if any may be particularly for actions that are in their early stages of investigation the parent company may be required to make significant restitution payments to cbna customers arising from certain compliance issues and also may be required to pay civil money penalties in connection with certain of these issues this uncertainty makes it difficult to estimate probable losses which in turn can lead to substantial disparities between the reserves we may establish for such proceedings and the eventual settlements fines or penalties adverse regulatory actions could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are and may be subject to litigation that may have a material impact on our business 

our operations are diverse and complex and we operate in legal and regulatory environments that expose us to potentially significant litigation risk in the normal course of business we have been named from time to time as a defendant in various legal actions including arbitrations class actions and other litigation arising in connection with our activities as a financial services institution including with respect to alleged unfair or deceptive business practices and misselling of certain products certain of the actual or threatened legal actions include claims for substantial compensatory andor punitive damages or claims for indeterminate amounts of damages in some cases the entities that would otherwise be the primary defendants in such cases are bankrupt or in financial distress moreover a number of recent judicial decisions have upheld the right of borrowers to sue lending institutions on the basis of various evolving legal theories collectively termed “lender liability” generally lender liability is founded on the premise that a lender has either violated a duty whether implied or contractual of good faith and fair dealing owed to the borrower or has assumed a degree of control over the borrower resulting in the creation of a fiduciary duty owed to the borrower or its other creditors or stockholders this could increase the amount of private litigation to which we are subject for more information regarding ongoing significant legal proceedings in which we may be involved see note 18 in item 8 

compliance with antimoney laundering and antiterrorism financing rules involves significant cost and effort 

we are subject to rules and regulations regarding money laundering and the financing of terrorism monitoring compliance with antimoney laundering and antiterrorism financing rules can put a significant financial burden on banks and other financial institutions and poses significant technical challenges although we believe our current policies and procedures are sufficient to comply with applicable rules and regulations we cannot guarantee that our antimoney laundering and antiterrorism financing policies and procedures completely prevent situations of money laundering or terrorism financing any such failure events may have severe 



consequences including sanctions fines and reputational consequences which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

risks related to our common stock 

our stock price may be volatile and you could lose all or part of your investment as a result 

you should consider an investment in our common stock to be risky and you should invest in our common stock only if you can withstand a significant loss and wide fluctuation in the market value of your investment the market price of our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to among other things the factors described in this “risk factors” section and other factors some of which are beyond our control these factors include 

• quarterly variations in our results of operations or the quarterly financial results of companies perceived to be similar to us 

• changes in expectations as to our future financial performance including financial estimates by securities analysts and investors 

• our announcements or our competitors’ announcements regarding new products or services enhancements significant contracts acquisitions or strategic investments 

• fluctuations in the market valuations of companies perceived by investors to be comparable to us 

• future sales of our common stock 

• additions or departures of members of our senior management or other key personnel 

• changes in industry conditions or perceptions and 

• changes in applicable laws rules or regulations and other dynamics 

furthermore the stock markets have experienced price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market price of equity securities of many companies these fluctuations have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies these broad market fluctuations as well as general economic systemic political and market conditions such as recessions loss of investor confidence interest rate changes or international currency fluctuations may negatively affect the market price of our common stock 

if any of the foregoing occurs it could cause our stock price to fall and may expose us to securities class action litigation that even if unsuccessful could be costly to defend and a distraction to management 

we may not repurchase shares or pay cash dividends on our common stock 

holders of our common stock are only entitled to receive such dividends as our board of directors may declare out of funds legally available for such payments although we have historically declared cash dividends on our common stock we are not required to do so and may reduce or eliminate our common stock dividend in the future this could adversely affect the market price of our common stock also as a bank holding company our ability to repurchase shares and declare and pay dividends is dependent on certain federal regulatory considerations including the rules of the frb regarding capital adequacy and dividends additionally we are required to submit periodic capital plans to the frb for review or otherwise obtain frb authorization before we can take certain capital actions including repurchasing shares declaring and paying dividends or repurchasing or redeeming capital securities if our capital plan or any amendment to our capital plan is objected to for any reason our ability to repurchase shares and declare and pay dividends on our capital stock may be limited further if we are unable to satisfy the capital requirements applicable to us for any reason we may be limited in our ability to repurchase shares and declare and pay dividends on our capital stock see the “regulation and supervision” section in item 1 for further discussion of the regulations to which we are subject 

“antitakeover” provisions and the regulations to which we are subject may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us even if the change in control would be beneficial to stockholders 

we are a bank holding company incorporated in the state of delaware antitakeover provisions in delaware law and our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws as well as regulatory approvals that would be required under federal law could make it more difficult for a third party to take control of us and may prevent stockholders from receiving a premium for their shares of our common stock these provisions could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and could reduce the amount that stockholders might get if we are sold 



we believe these provisions protect our stockholders from coercive or otherwise unfair takeover tactics by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with our board and by providing our board with more time to assess any acquisition proposal however these provisions apply even if the offer may be determined to be beneficial by some stockholders and could delay or prevent an acquisition that our board determines is not in our best interest and that of our stockholders 

furthermore banking laws impose notice approval and ongoing regulatory requirements on any stockholder or other party that seeks to acquire direct or indirect “control” of an fdicinsured depository institution these laws include the bank holding company act and the change in bank control act

this document contains nongaap financial measures denoted as “underlying” results underlying results for any given reporting period exclude certain items that may occur in that period which management does not consider indicative of our ongoing financial performance we believe these nongaap financial measures provide useful information to investors because they are used by management to evaluate our operating performance and make daytoday operating decisions in addition we believe our underlying results in any given reporting period reflect our ongoing financial performance and increase comparability of periodtoperiod results and accordingly are useful to consider in addition to our gaap financial results 

other companies may use similarly titled nongaap financial measures that are calculated differently from the way we calculate such measures accordingly our nongaap financial measures may not be comparable to similar measures used by such companies we caution investors not to place undue reliance on such nongaap financial measures but to consider them with the most directly comparable gaap measures nongaap financial measures have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for our results reported under gaap 

nongaap measures are denoted throughout our mda by the use of the term nongaap or underlying and where there is a reference to nongaap or underlying results in that paragraph all measures that follow that reference are on the same basis when applicable for more information on the computation of nongaap financial measures see “—nongaap financial measures and reconciliations”

results of operations — 2020 compared with 2019 

net interest income 

net interest income is our largest source of revenue and is the difference between the interest earned on interestearning assets generally loans leases and investment securities and the interest expense incurred in connection with interestbearing liabilities generally deposits and borrowed funds the level of net interest income is primarily a function of the difference between the effective yield on our average interestearning assets and the effective cost of our interestbearing liabilities these factors are influenced by the pricing and mix of interestearning assets and interestbearing liabilities which in turn are impacted by external factors such as local economic conditions competition for loans and deposits the monetary policy of the frb and market interest rates for further discussion refer to “—market risk — nontrading risk” and “—risk governance” 





1 interest income and rates on loans include loan fees additionally 10 billion and 728 million of average nonaccrual loans were included in the average loan balances used to determine the average yield on loans for december 2020 and 2019 respectively 

2 net interest income and net interest margin is presented on a fully taxableequivalent “fte” basis using the federal statutory tax rate of 21 the fte impact is predominantly attributable to commercial and industrial loans for the periods presented 

net interest income of 46 billion decreased 28 million reflecting 8 average interestearning asset growth including the addition of ppp loans and improvements in funding mix and deposit pricing that were more than offset by a 26 basis point decrease in net interest margin given the lower rate and challenging yield curve environment 

net interest margin on an fte basis of 289 decreased 27 basis points compared to 316 in 2019 primarily reflecting the impact of lower interest rates and elevated cash balances given strong deposit flows elevated cash balances drove 8 basis points of the decline partially offset by improved funding mix and deposit 



pricing average interestearning asset yields of 335 decreased 84 basis points from 419 in 2019 while average interestbearing liability costs of 069 decreased 77 basis points from 146 in 2019 reflecting strong pricing discipline 

average interestearning assets of 1593 billion increased 125 billion or 8 from 2019 driven by a 55 billion increase in average commercial loans a 44 billion increase in total investment securities and interestbearing cash and due from banks and deposits in banks a 15 billion increase in average total loans held for sale and a 11 billion increase in average retail loans commercial growth was driven by commercial and industrial primarily ppp loans and commercial real estate retail growth was driven by education and other retail partially offset by home equity 

average deposits of 1387 billion increased 154 billion from 2019 as a result of government stimulus benefiting consumers and small businesses and clients building liquidity given covid19 disruption increases in demand deposits money market accounts savings and checking with interest were partially offset by a decrease in term deposits total interestbearing deposit costs of 509 million decreased 646 million or 56 from 12 billion in 2019 primarily due to a lower rate environment and strong pricing discipline 

average total borrowed funds of 112 billion decreased 25 billion from 2019 as strong deposit flows allowed for significantly lower levels of borrowings with fhlb advances near zero at periodend and a reduction in senior and subordinated debt total borrowed funds costs of 262 million decreased 158 million from 2019 the total borrowed funds cost of 233 decreased 73 basis points from 306 in 2019 due to the impact of covid19 on the rate environment 



1 volume and rate changes have been allocated on a consistent basis using the respective percentage changes in average balances and average rates 



noninterest income 



1 includes bankowned life insurance income and other income for all periods presented and net impairment losses recognized in earnings on available for sale debt securities for the 2019 period 

noninterest income of 23 billion increased 442 million or 24 from 2019 reflecting increased mortgage banking fees due to higher origination volumes and gain on sale margins and capital markets fees these results were partially offset by lower service charges and fees and card fees as well as lower foreign exchange and interest rate products revenue reflecting challenging market conditions results also reflected decreased securities gains and other income given lower leasing income and lower gains related to asset dispositions partially offset by gain on sale of education loans 



noninterest expense 



noninterest expense of 40 billion in 2020 increased 144 million or 4 compared to 2019 r eflecting higher salaries and employee benefits reflecting strong mortgage production outside services tied to growth initiatives and an increase in equipment and software expense given continued investments in technology these results were partially offset by lower other operating expense given a decline in travel pension and advertising expenses  underlying noninterest expense increased 87 million or 2 due to the reasons listed above 



provision for credit losses 

the provision for credit losses is the result of a detailed analysis performed to estimate our acl the total provision for credit losses includes the provision for loan and lease losses and the provision for unfunded commitments refer to “—analysis of financial condition — allowance for credit losses and nonaccruing loans and leases” for more information 

provision for credit losses of 16 billion included a 923 million reserve build primarily associated with the impact of the covid19 pandemic and associated lockdowns on our loan portfolio which resulted in a sudden rise in unemployment and drop in gdp net chargeoffs of 693 million increased 263 million from 2019 which reflected chargeoffs in our commercial portfolio concentrated in certain subcategories including retail real estate metals and mining energy and related and casual dining as well as the impact of continued seasoning in retail growth portfolios and loan growth 

  

income tax expense 

income tax expense of 241 million decreased 219 million from 460 million in 2019 the 2020 effective tax rate of 185 decreased from 204 in 2019 driven by the increased benefit of taxadvantaged investments on lower pretax income an underlying effective tax rate of 199 in 2020 compared to 220 in 2019 



business operating segments 

we have two business operating segments consumer banking and commercial banking segment results are derived by specifically attributing managed assets liabilities capital and related revenues provision for credit losses which at the segment level is equal to net chargeoffs and other expenses the residual difference between the consolidated provision for credit losses and the business operating segments’ net chargeoffs is reflected in other 

nonsegment operations are classified as other which includes corporate functions the treasury function the securities portfolio wholesale funding activities intangible assets not directly allocated to a business operating segment community development noncore assets and other unallocated assets liabilities capital revenues provision for credit losses expenses and income tax expense in addition other includes goodwill not directly allocated to a business operating segment and any associated goodwill impairment charges for impairment testing purposes we allocate all goodwill to our consumer banking andor commercial banking reporting units 

our capital levels are evaluated and managed centrally however capital is allocated on a riskadjusted basis to the business operating segments to support evaluation of business performance because funding and asset liability management is a central function funds transferpricing “ftp” methodologies are utilized to allocate a cost of funds used or credit for the funds provided to all business operating segment assets liabilities and capital respectively using a matchedfunding concept the residual effect on net interest income of assetliability management including the residual net interest income related to the ftp process is included in other we periodically evaluate and refine our methodologies used to measure financial performance of our business operating segments 

noninterest income and expense are directly attributed to each business operating segment including fees service charges salaries and benefits and other direct revenues and costs and are respectively accounted for in a manner similar to our consolidated financial statements occupancy costs are allocated based on utilization of facilities by each business operating segment noninterest expenses incurred by centrally managed operations or business operating segments that directly support another business operating segment’s operations are charged to the applicable business operating segment based on its utilization of those services 

income tax expense is assessed to each business operating segment at a standard tax rate with the residual tax expense or benefit to arrive at the consolidated effective tax rate included in other 

developing and applying methodologies used to allocate items among the business operating segments is a dynamic process accordingly financial results may be revised periodically as management systems are enhanced methods of evaluating performance or product lines are updated or our organizational structure changes 



the following table presents certain financial data of our business operating segments total business operating segment financial results differ from total consolidated net income these differences are reflected in other nonsegment operations see note 25 in item 8 for further information 



1 includes lhfs 

2 the majority of ppp loans are reflected in consumer banking in accordance with how they are managed 

consumer banking 

net interest income increased 129 million or 4 from 2019 driven by the benefit of a 48 billion increase in average loans led by education other retail and the impact of the ppp loan program partially offset by lower deposit margins driven by the low rate environment noninterest income increased 499 million or 43 from 2019 driven by mortgage banking fees reflecting strong origination volumes and gain on sale margins and other income gain on sale of education loans partially offset by lower service charges and fees higher deposit balances and lower transaction volumes and card fees lower transaction volumes noninterest expense increased 113 million or 4 from 2019 reflecting higher salaries and employee benefits costs tied to higher mortgage origination volumes and ppp loans net chargeoffs of 288 million decreased 37 million or 11 reflecting the impact of loan forbearance programs 

commercial banking 

net interest income of 16 billion decreased 177 million or 12 from 2019 primarily due to the low rate environment partially offset by higher loan and lowercosting deposit volume noninterest income of 595 million decreased 12 million or 2 from 607 million in 2019 as higher capital markets fees were offset by a decrease in other income and foreign exchange and interest rate products noninterest expense of 860 million increased 2 million  from 858 million in 2019  driven by higher salaries and employee benefits partially offset by lower travel costs  net chargeoffs of 398 million increased 301 million from 2019 driven by the impact of covid19 and associated lockdowns primarily in the retail real estate metals and mining energy and related and casual dining industries

analysis of financial condition 

securities 



our securities portfolio is managed to maintain prudent levels of liquidity credit quality and market risk while achieving appropriate returns that align with our overall portfolio management strategy the portfolio includes high quality highly liquid investments reflecting our ongoing commitment to appropriate contingent liquidity levels and pledging capacity us governmentguaranteed notes and gseissued mortgagebacked securities represent 95 of the fair value of our debt securities portfolio holdings holdings backed by mortgages dominate our portfolio and facilitate our ability to pledge those securities to the fhlb for collateral purposes 

the fair value of the afs debt securities portfolio of 229 billion at december 31 2020 increased 23 billion from 206 billion at december 31 2019 largely reflecting an increase of 18 billion related to reinvestment timing and a 482 million increase in value from lower longterm rates the fair value of the htm debt securities portfolio decreased 115 million largely reflecting portfolio runoff partially offset by the reclass of certain abs in september 2020 we purchased 813 million of assetbacked securities which were recorded as afs however in october 2020 management transferred these securities to htm after concluding to hold these securities through maturity for further information see note 1 in item 8 

as of december 31 2020 the portfolio’s average effective duration was 27 years compared with 37 years as of december 31 2019 as lower longterm rates drove an increase in both actual and projected securities prepayment speeds we manage our securities portfolio duration and convexity risk through asset selection and securities structure and maintain duration levels within our risk appetite in the context of the broader interest rate risk in the banking book framework and limits 





1 expected maturities may differ from contractual maturities because issuers may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without incurring penalties 

2 as of december 31 2020 no investment exceeded 10 of stockholders’ equity 

3 yields on taxexempt securities are not computed on a taxequivalent basis 

4 yields exclude the impact of hedging activity 

loans and leases 



1 the commercial loan class has been renamed commercial and industrial and the commercial loans and leases loan segment has been renamed commercial 

2 the december 31 2020 commercial and industrial balance included ppp loans fully guaranteed by the sba 

3 beginning in the first quarter of 2020 home equity loans home equity lines of credit home equity loans serviced by others and home equity lines of credit serviced by others are included in home equity prior periods have been adjusted to conform with the current period presentation 

4 beginning in the first quarter of 2020 credit card and other retail are included in other retail prior periods have been adjusted to conform with the current period presentation 

total loans and leases increased 40 billion or 3 from 1191 billion as of december 31 2019 largely driven by commercial ppp loans to small business customers growth in retail loans driven by education was muted in part by the sale of education loans in september and december 2020 amounting to 11 billion inclusive of accrued interest capitalized interest and fees and a decline in home equity and other retail for further information see note 10 in item 8 

ppp loans to small business customers totaled approximately 47 billion for the quarters ended june 30 2020 and september 30 2020 and 42 billion as of december 31 2020 average ppp loans totaled approximately 34 billion 47 billion and 45 billion for the quarters ended june 30 2020 september 30 2020 and december 31 2020 respectively there were no outstanding ppp loans as of and during the quarter ended march 31 2020 



as of december 31 2020 under our covid19related forbearance programs that are guided by the cares act as well as banking regulator interagency guidance we have deferred payments on 

• approximately 14 billion or 23 of our retail portfolio for which the weighted average fico score is 711 

◦ 94 of customers that exited forbearance are current on payments 

◦ although not required approximately 42 of our residential mortgage borrowers have made payment while in active forbearance and the weighted average loantovalue of the 700 million in residential mortgage loans in active forbearance is 62 

• approximately 343 million or 06 of our commercial portfolio including approximately 53 million or 10 of our small business portfolio 

the vast majority of these deferrals are not classified as tdrs 



loan and lease concentrations 

at december 31 2020 we did not identify any concentration of loans and leases exceeding 10 of total loans and leases that were not otherwise disclosed as a category of loans and leases for further information on how we manage concentration exposures see note 5 in item 8 



allowance for credit losses and nonaccruing loans and leases 

the acl which consists of an alll and a reserve for unfunded lending commitments is created through charges to the provision for credit losses in order to provide appropriate reserves to absorb future estimated credit losses in accordance with gaap for further information on our processes to determine our acl see “—critical accounting estimates — allowance for credit losses” and note 5 in item 8 

  summary of loan and lease loss experience 













the alll represented 198 of total loans and leases and 240 of npls as of december 31 2020 compared with 105 and 178 respectively as of december 31 2019 



risk elements 



1 tdr balances reported in this line item consist of only those tdrs not reported in the nonaccrual loan or accruing and 90 days or more delinquent loan categories thus only those tdrs that are in compliance with their modified terms and not past due or those tdrs that are past due 3089 days and still accruing are included in the tdr balances listed above 

npls of 10 billion as of december 31 2020 increased 316 million from december 31 2019 driven by a 103 million increase in retail reflecting growth in mortgage npls and a 213 million increase in commercial npls reflecting a deterioration in certain industry sectors from the impacts of covid19 and associated lockdowns ncos of 693 million increased 263 million or 61 from 430 million in 2019 reflecting chargeoffs in our commercial portfolio related to retail real estate metals and mining energy and related and casual dining while retail ncos were down compared to 2019 due in large part to us government stimulus programs and forbearance ncos as a percentage of total average loans of 056 increased 20 basis points compared to 036 in 2019 

we continue to assess the impact of the covid19 pandemic and associated lockdowns and have instituted a variety of measures to identify and monitor areas of potential risk including direct outreach to commercial clients and close monitoring of retail credit metrics 

potential problem loans and leases 

at december 31 2020 we did not identify any potential problem loans or leases within the portfolio that were not already disclosed in “—risk elements” and “—commercial loan asset quality” potential problem loans or leases consist of loans and leases where information about a borrower’s possible credit problems cause management to have serious doubts as to the ability of a borrower to comply with the present repayment terms 

commercial loan asset quality 

our commercial portfolio consists of traditional commercial and industrial and commercial real estate loans the portfolio is largely comprised of customers in our footprint and adjacent states in which we have a physical presence where our local delivery model provides for strong client connectivity we also lend nationally to companies that fall within targeted client industry and geographic expansion strategies 



commercial npls increased 213 million to 458 million as of december 31 2020 from 245 million as of december 31 2019 as of december 31 2020 total commercial npls were 08 of the commercial portfolio and increased from 04 at december 31 2019 total 2020 commercial portfolio net chargeoffs of 425 million increased from 116 million in 2019 for the year ended december 31 2020 the commercial portfolio annualized net chargeoff ratio of 067 increased from 020 for the year ended december 31 2019 reflecting chargeoffs in the retail real estate metals and mining energy and related and casual dining industry sectors 

the increases in commercial npls and ncos were driven largely by a deterioration in certain industry sectors including retail real estate casual dining and energy and related resulting from the impacts of covid19 and associated lockdowns 

for commercial we utilize regulatory classification ratings to monitor credit quality for more information on regulatory classification ratings see note 5 in item 8 the recorded investment in commercial based on regulatory classification ratings is presented below 



1 pass includes ppp loans 



total commercial criticized balances of 46 billion as of december 31 2020 increased 16 billion compared with december 31 2019 commercial criticized as a percent of total commercial of 76 at december 31 2020 increased from 53 at december 31 2019 

commercial and industrial criticized balances of 33 billion or 75 of the total commercial and industrial loan portfolio as of december 31 2020 increased from 25 billion or 61 as of december 31 2019 the increase was due to the migration to criticized loans for hospitality energy and related and casual dining commercial and industrial criticized loans represented 71 of total criticized loans as of december 31 2020 compared to 83 as of december 31 2019 

commercial real estate criticized balances of 13 billion or 88 of the commercial real estate portfolio increased from 353 million or 26 as of december 31 2019 the increase was due to the migration to criticized loans for a few larger borrowers in the hospitality and retail industry sectors commercial real estate accounted for 28 of total criticized loans as of december 31 2020 compared to 12 as of december 31 2019 



 1 deferred fees and costs are reported in all other 

2 excludes ppp loans for the yearended december 31 2020 

retail loan asset quality 

for retail loans we utilize credit scores provided by fico which are generally refreshed on a quarterly basis and the loan’s payment and delinquency status to monitor credit quality management believes fico credit scores are considered the strongest indicator of credit losses over the contractual life of the loan as the scores are based on current and historical national industrywide consumer level credit performance data and assist management in predicting the borrower’s future payment performance the largest portion of the retail portfolio is represented by borrowers located in the new england midatlantic and midwest regions although we have continued to lend selectively in areas outside the footprint primarily in the auto finance and education lending 





for more information on the aging of accruing and nonaccruing retail loans see note 5 in item 8 



1 the real estate secured portfolio cltv is calculated as the mortgage and second lien loan balance divided by the most recently available value of the property 



retail asset quality remained relatively stable with december 31 2019 the net chargeoff rate of 044 for the year ended december 31 2020 reflected a decrease of 8 basis points from the year ended december 31 2019 driven by the forbearance and stimulus activity stemming from the covid19 pandemic and associated lockdowns 

troubled debt restructurings 

tdr is the classification given to a loan that has been restructured in a manner that grants a concession to a borrower experiencing financial hardship that we would not otherwise make tdrs typically result from our loss mitigation efforts and are undertaken in order to improve the likelihood of recovery and continuity of the relationship our loan modifications are handled on a casebycase basis and are negotiated to achieve mutually agreeable terms that maximize loan collectability and meet our borrower’s financial needs the types of concessions include interest rate reductions term extensions principal forgiveness and other modifications to the structure of the loan that fall outside our lending policy depending on the specific facts and circumstances of the customer restructuring can involve loans moving to nonaccrual remaining on nonaccrual or remaining on accrual status 

in the first quarter of 2020 we adopted the cares act and interagency guidance issued by the bank regulatory agencies which provide that covid19related modifications to retail and commercial loans that met certain eligibility criteria are exempt from classification as a tdr loans with payment deferrals and forbearance plans entered into as a result of the covid19 pandemic and associated lockdowns were generally not considered tdrs 

as of december 31 2020 718 million of retail loans were classified as tdrs compared with 667 million as of december 31 2019 as of december 31 2020 171 million of retail tdrs were in nonaccrual status with 38 current with payments compared to 143 million in nonaccrual status with 38 current on payments at december 31 2019 tdrs generally return to accrual status once repayment capacity and appropriate payment history can be established tdrs are individually evaluated for impairment and loans once classified as tdrs remain classified as tdrs until paid off sold or refinanced at market terms for additional information regarding tdrs see “—critical accounting estimates — allowance for credit losses” and note 5 in item 8 







impact of nonperforming loans and leases on interest income 

the following table presents the gross interest income for both nonaccrual and restructured loans that would have been recognized if those loans had been current in accordance with their original contractual terms and had been outstanding throughout the year or since origination if held for only part of the year the table also presents the interest income related to these loans that was actually recognized for the year 



1 based on the contractual rate that was being charged at the time the loan was restructured or placed on nonaccrual status 

crossborder outstandings

capital and regulatory matters 

as a bank holding company and a financial holding company we are subject to regulation and supervision by the frb our banking subsidiary cbna is a national banking association whose primary federal regulator is the occ our regulation and supervision continues to evolve as the legal and regulatory frameworks governing our operations continue to change for more information see the “regulation and supervision” section in item 1 

tailoring of prudential requirements 

in october 2019 the frb and the other banking regulators finalized rules that tailor the application of the enhanced prudential standards to bank holding companies and depository institutions to implement the egrrcpa amendments to the doddfrank act “tailoring rules” under the tailoring rules category iv firms such as us are subject to biennial supervisory stresstesting and are exempt from companyrun stress testing and related disclosure requirements category iv firms are also no longer required to submit resolution plans the frb continues to supervise category iv firms on an ongoing basis including evaluation of the capital adequacy and capital planning processes during offcycle years we remain subject to the requirement to develop maintain and submit an annual capital plan for review and approval by our board of directors or one of its committees as well as fr y14 reporting requirements on april 6 2020 we submitted our 2020 capital plan to the frb under the frb’s 2020 ccar process for more information see the “tailoring of prudential requirements” section in item 1 

on march 4 2020 the frb finalized a stress capital buffer “scb” requirement that integrates regulatory capital requirements with the results of the frb’s supervisory stress tests by replacing the static ccb of 25 with a dynamic scb requirement the new scb requirement is based on the projected losses under the supervisory severely adverse scenario of each firm subject to ccar plus four quarters of planned common stock dividends subject to a floor of 25 under the scb framework the frb will no longer object to capital plans on quantitative grounds and each firm will be required to maintain capital ratios above the sum of its minimum requirements and the scb requirements to avoid restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments for category iv firms like us the frb has stated that the scb will be recalibrated with each biennial supervisory stress test and updated annually to reflect our planned common stock dividends and common share buybacks on october 1 2020 our scb of 34 became effective and will apply to our capital actions through september 30 2021 

on september 30 2020 the frb issued a proposed rule to make conforming changes to its capital plan rule stress capital buffer requirements and capital planning requirements to be consistent with the tailoring rules framework under the proposal category iv firms like us would have the ability to elect to participate in the supervisory stress test and receive an updated scb requirement in a year in which they are not subject to the supervisory stress test for purposes of calculating the scb in 2021 the proposed rule would require us to notify the frb of our intention to participate in the 2021 supervisory stress test by april 5 2021 

in light of the heightened uncertainty related to the covid19 pandemic and associated lockdowns the frb took certain actions to preserve capital at banks among those actions the frb imposed certain limitations on firms for the third and fourth quarters of 2020 including mandatory suspension of share repurchases and limiting common stock dividends to existing rates and the average quarterly net income for the prior four quarters further the frb required that ccar firms like us conduct an additional round of stress tests and resubmit updated capital plans to reflect changes in the macroeconomic environment due to the covid19 pandemic consistent with the frb’s mandate we resubmitted our capital plan on november 2 2020 the results of our resubmission received on december 18 2020 exceeded all capital requirements under the frb’s severe stress scenarios and we reiterated key aspects of our 2020 capital plan which include maintaining quarterly common dividends of 039 per common share through the scb window period ending third quarter 2021 in december 2020 the frb modified its limitations on capital distributions for the first quarter of 2021 such that firms that participate in ccar like us may resume share repurchases provided that the aggregate of share repurchases and common stock dividends for the first quarter of 2021 do not exceed average quarterly net income for the trailing four quarters the frb can extend or modify its current capital distribution limitations in future quarters in january 2021 our board of directors authorized us to repurchase up to 750 million of our common stock beginning in the first quarter of 2021 the timing and amount of future dividends and share 



repurchases will depend on various factors including our capital position financial performance riskweighted assets capital impacts of strategic initiatives market conditions and regulatory considerations all future capital distributions are subject to consideration and approval by the board of directors prior to execution 

regulations relating to capital planning regulatory reporting and stress capital buffer requirements applicable to firms like us are presently subject to rulemaking and potential further guidance and interpretation by the applicable federal regulators we will continue to evaluate the impact of these and any other prudential regulatory changes including their potential resultant changes in our regulatory and compliance costs and expenses 

capital framework 

under the current us basel iii capital framework we and our banking subsidiary must meet the following specific minimum requirements cet1 capital ratio of 45 tier 1 capital ratio of 60 total capital ratio of 80 and tier 1 leverage ratio of 40 as a bank holding company our scb of 34 is imposed on top of the three minimum riskbased capital ratios listed above and a ccb of 25 is imposed on top of the three minimum riskbased capital ratios listed above for our banking subsidiary 

effective for us on april 1 2020 the cet1 deduction threshold for msrs certain deferred tax assets and significant investments in the capital of unconsolidated institutions is 25 as of december 31 2020 we did not meet the threshold for these additional capital deductions msrs or deferred tax assets not deducted from cet1 capital are assigned a 250 risk weight and significant investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions not deducted from cet1 capital are assigned an exposure category risk weight 

in reaction to the covid19 pandemic the frb and the other federal banking regulators adopted a final rule relative to regulatory capital treatment of acl under cecl this rule allowed electing banking organizations to delay the estimated impact of cecl on regulatory capital for a twoyear period ending january 1 2022 followed by a threeyear transition period ending january 1 2025 to phasein the aggregate amount of the capital benefit provided during the initial twoyear delay as of december 31 2020 568 million of the capital benefit has been accumulated for application to the threeyear transition period 



1 required “minimum capital ratio” for 2020 and 2019 are common equity tier 1 capital of 45 tier 1 capital of 60 total capital of 80 and tier 1 leverage of 40 

2 “minimum capital ratio” includes stress capital buffer of 34 for 2020 and capital conservation buffer of 25 for 2019 na to tier 1 leverage 

at december 31 2020 our cet1 capital tier 1 capital and total capital ratios were 100 113 and 134 respectively as compared with 100 111 and 130 respectively as of december 31 2019 the cet1 capital ratio remained stable as 39 billion of riskweighted asset “rwa” growth and the impact of the capital actions described in “—capital transactions” below were primarily offset by net income for the year ended december 31 2020 and 25 of the increase in aacl subsequent to cecl adoption the tier 1 capital ratio increased due to the changes in cet1 capital and the issuance of series f preferred stock described in “—capital transactions” below the total capital ratio increased due to the changes in cet1 and tier 1 capital and the net change in aacl attributable to cecl adoption the modified transition amount and excess acl partially offset by 



the subordinated debt exchange offers described in “—regulatory capital ratios and capital composition” below and an increase in nonqualifying subordinated debt at december 31 2020 our cet1 capital tier 1 capital and total capital ratios were approximately 210 basis points 190 basis points and 200 basis points respectively above their regulatory minimums plus our stress capital buffer all ratios remained well above the us basel iii minima 

regulatory capital ratios and capital composition 

cet1 capital under us basel iii standardized rules totaled 146 billion at december 31 2020 and increased 303 million from 143 billion at december 31 2019 largely driven by net income for the year ended december 31 2020 and 25 of the increase in aacl subsequent to cecl adoption partially offset by dividends and common share repurchases tier 1 capital at december 31 2020 totaled 166 billion reflecting a 698 million increase from 159 billion at december 31 2019 driven by the changes in cet1 capital and the issuance of series f preferred stock at december 31 2020 we had 20 billion of noncumulative perpetual preferred stock issued and outstanding an increase of 395 million from 16 billion at december 31 2019 given the second quarter 2020 issuance of 400000 shares of series f preferred stock that qualified as additional tier 1 capital total capital of 196 billion at december 31 2020 increased 11 billion from december 31 2019 driven by the changes in cet1 and tier 1 capital and the net change in aacl partially offset by a decrease in qualifying subordinated debt 

rwa totaled 1468 billion at december 31 2020 based on us basel iii standardized rules up 39 billion from december 31 2019 this increase was driven by higher derivative valuations increases in education loans commercial real estate loans msr rwa resulting from the finalization of the simplification rules which increased risk weight from 100 to 250 and increases in residential mortgages loans held for sale and commercial past due loans these rwa increases were partially offset by decreases in high volatility commercial real estate commercial loans home equity loans and consumer personal loans 

as of december 31 2020 the tier 1 leverage ratio was 94 decreasing from 100 at december 31 2019 driven by the 166 billion increase in quarterly adjusted average assets partially offset by higher tier one capital the increase in quarterly adjusted average assets was primarily driven by the covid19 pandemic and associated lockdowns resulting in increased cash level of 93 billion and an increase in total loans of 46 billion the increased cash is a result of higher deposits caused by government stimulus and commercial clients building liquidity the increase in total loans is primarily the result of an increase in commercial and industrial loans from ppp 





1 as a us basel iii standardized approach institution we selected the onetime election to optout of the requirements to include all the components of aoci 

2 as of december 31 2020 and 2019 the amount of nonqualifying subordinated debt excluded from regulatory capital was 348 million and 267 million respectively 

on february 11 2021 we completed 265 million in private exchange offers for five series of outstanding subordinated notes exchange offer participants received newly issued subordinated notes due 2031 which are redeemable by us five years prior to their maturity in september 2020 we completed 621 million in private exchange offers for five series of outstanding subordinated notes exchange offer participants received a combination of our newly issued subordinated notes due 2032 and an additional cash payment we also completed related cash tender offers which result in 11 million of subordinated notes being validly tendered and accepted for purchase by us and subsequently cancelled the completion of these subordinated debt exchange offers will benefit our tier 2 and total capital going forward by increasing the amount of subordinated debt eligible for inclusion in tier 2 capital without increasing the aggregate principal amount of subordinated debt outstanding 

capital adequacy process 

our assessment of capital adequacy begins with our risk appetite and risk management framework this framework provides for the identification measurement and management of material risks capital requirements are determined for actual and forecasted risk portfolios using applicable regulatory capital methodologies the assessment also considers the possible impacts of approved and proposed changes to regulatory capital requirements key analytical frameworks including stress testing which enable the assessment of capital adequacy versus unexpected loss under a variety of stress scenarios supplement our base line forecast a governance framework supports our capital planning process including capital management policies and procedures that document capital adequacy metrics and limits as well as our capital contingency plan and the active engagement of both the legalentity boards and senior management in oversight and decisionmaking 

forwardlooking assessments of capital adequacy feed development of a single capital plan covering us and our banking subsidiary that is periodically submitted to the frb we prepare this plan in full compliance with the frb’s capital plan rule and we participate annually in the frb’s horizontal capital review which is the frb’s assessment of specific capital planning areas as part of their normal supervisory process 

all distributions proposed under our capital plan are subject to consideration and approval by our board of directors prior to execution the timing and exact amount of future dividends and share repurchases will depend on various factors including our capital position financial performance and market conditions

banking subsidiary’s capital 



cbna cet1 and tier 1 capital totaled 160 billion at december 31 2020 up 422 million from 156 billion at december 31 2019 the increase was primarily driven by net income for the year ended december 31 2020 and 25 of the increase in aacl subsequent to cecl adoption partially offset by dividend payments to the parent company total capital was 190 billion at december 31 2020 an increase of 10 billion from 179 billion at december 31 2019 driven by the change in cet1 capital the net change in aacl and an increase in qualifying subordinated debt 

cbna had rwa of 1466 billion at december 31 2020 an increase of 40 billion from december 31 2019 driven by higher derivative valuations increases in education loans commercial real estate loans msr rwa resulting from the finalization of the simplification rules which increased risk weight from 100 to 250 and increases in residential mortgages loans held for sale and commercial past due loans these rwa increases were partially offset by decreases in high volatility commercial real estate commercial loans home equity loans and consumer personal loans 

as of december 31 2020 the cbna tier 1 leverage ratio decreased to 92 from 99 at december 31 2019 driven by the 166 billion increase in quarterly adjusted average assets partially offset by higher tier one capital the increase in quarterly adjusted average assets was primarily driven by covid19 and the associated lockdowns resulting in increased cash level of 93 billion and an increase in total loans of 46 billion the 



increased cash is a result of higher deposits caused by government stimulus and commercial clients building liquidity the increase in total loans is primarily the result of an increase in commercial and industrial loans from ppp 

liquidity 

liquidity is defined as our ability to meet our cash flow and collateral obligations in a timely manner at a reasonable cost an institution must maintain operating liquidity to meet its expected daily and forecasted cash flow requirements as well as contingent liquidity to meet unexpected stress scenario funding requirements as noted earlier reflecting the importance of meeting all unexpected and stress scenario funding requirements we identify and manage contingent liquidity consisting of cash balances at the frb unencumbered highquality and liquid securities and unused fhlb borrowing capacity separately we also identify and manage asset liquidity as a subset of contingent liquidity consisting of cash balances at the frb and unencumbered highquality securities we consider the effective and prudent management of liquidity fundamental to our health and strength 

we manage liquidity at the consolidated enterprise level and at each material legal entity including at the parent company and cbna level 

parent company liquidity 

our parent company’s primary sources of cash are dividends and interest received from cbna as a result of investing in bank equity and subordinated debt and externally issued preferred stock as well as senior and subordinated debt uses of cash include the routine cash flow requirements as a bank holding company including periodic share repurchases and payments of dividends interest and expenses the needs of subsidiaries including cbna for additional equity and as required its need for debt financing and the support for extraordinary funding requirements when necessary to the extent the parent company has relied on wholesale borrowings uses also include payments of related principal and interest 

during the year ended december 31 2020 the parent company completed the following transactions 

• issued 400 million or 400000 shares of 5650 fixedrate reset noncumulative perpetual series f preferred stock on june 4 2020 

• issued 750 million in tenyear 3250 fixedrate senior notes on april 30 2020 and 

• issued 300 million in tenyear 2500 fixedrate senior notes on february 6 2020 

for further information on outstanding debt and preferred stock see note 12 and note 16 in item 8 

during the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 the parent company declared and paid dividends on common stock of 672 million and 617 million respectively and declared dividends on preferred stock of 107 million and 73 million respectively in addition the parent company repurchased 270 million and 12 billion of its outstanding common stock respectively 

our parent company’s cash and cash equivalents represent a source of liquidity that can be used to meet various needs and totaled 27 billion as of december 31 2020 compared with 14 billion as of december 31 2019 the parent company’s doubleleverage ratio the combined equity investment in parent company subsidiaries divided by parent company equity is a measure of reliance on equity cash flows from subsidiaries to fund parent company obligations at december 31 2020 the parent company’s doubleleverage ratio was 98 

cbna liquidity 

in the ordinary course of business the liquidity of cbna is managed by matching sources and uses of cash the primary sources of bank liquidity include deposits from our consumer and commercial customers payments of principal and interest on loans and debt securities and wholesale borrowings as needed and as described under “—liquidity risk management and governance” the primary uses of bank liquidity include withdrawals and maturities of deposits payment of interest on deposits funding of loans and related commitments and funding of securities purchases to the extent that cbna has relied on wholesale borrowings uses also include payments of related principal and interest for further information on cbna’s outstanding debt see note 12 in item 8 

as cbna’s primary business involves taking deposits and making loans a key role of liquidity management is to ensure that customers have timely access to funds from deposits and for loans liquidity management also 



involves maintaining sufficient liquidity to repay wholesale borrowings pay operating expenses and support extraordinary funding requirements when necessary 

on april 30 2020 cbna issued 750 million in fiveyear 2250 fixedrate senior notes 

liquidity risk 

we define liquidity risk as the risk that an entity will be unable to meet its payment obligations in a timely manner at a reasonable cost liquidity risk can arise due to contingent liquidity risk andor funding liquidity risk 

contingent liquidity risk is the risk that market conditions may reduce an entity’s ability to liquidate pledge andor finance certain assets and thereby substantially reduce the liquidity value of such assets drivers of contingent liquidity risk include general market disruptions as well as specific issues regarding the credit quality andor valuation of a security or loan issuer or borrower andor asset class 

funding liquidity risk is the risk that market conditions andor entityspecific events may reduce an entity’s ability to raise funds from depositors andor wholesale market counterparties drivers of funding liquidity risk may be idiosyncratic or systemic reflecting impediments to operations andor damaged market confidence 

factors affecting liquidity 

given the composition of assets and borrowing sources contingent liquidity risk at cbna would be materially affected by events such as deterioration of financing markets for highquality securities eg mortgagebacked securities and other instruments issued by the gnma fnma and the fhlmc by any inability of the fhlbs to provide collateralized advances andor by a refusal of the frb to act as a lender of last resort in systemic stress 

similarly given the structure of its balance sheet the funding liquidity risk of cbna would be materially affected by an adverse idiosyncratic event eg a major loss causing a perceived or actual deterioration in its financial condition an adverse systemic event eg default or bankruptcy of a significant capital markets participant or a combination of both consequently and despite ongoing exposure to a variety of idiosyncratic and systemic events we view our contingent liquidity risk and our funding liquidity risk to be relatively modest 

an additional variable affecting our access to unsecured wholesale market funds and to large denomination ie uninsured customer deposits is the credit ratings assigned by such agencies as moody’s standard  poor’s and fitch 

 nr  not rated 

changes in our public credit ratings could affect both the cost and availability of our wholesale funding as a result and in order to maintain a conservative funding profile cbna continues to minimize reliance on unsecured wholesale funding at december 31 2020 our wholesale funding consisted primarily of secured borrowings from the fhlbs collateralized by highquality residential mortgages and term debt issued by the parent company and cbna 

existing and evolving regulatory liquidity requirements represent another key driver of systemic liquidity conditions and liquidity management practices the frb the occ and the fdic regularly evaluate our liquidity as 



part of the overall supervisory process in addition we are subject to existing and evolving regulatory liquidity requirements some of which are subject to further rulemaking guidance and interpretation by the applicable federal regulators for further discussion see the “regulation and supervision — financial regulatory reform” and “—liquidity requirements” sections in item 1 

the lcr was developed by the us federal banking regulators to ensure banks have sufficient highquality liquid assets to cover expected net cash outflows over a 30day liquidity stress period in accordance with the october 2019 final rules category iv institutions with less than 50 billion in weighted shortterm wholesale funding such as us are no longer subject to the requirements of the lcr rule as of december 31 2019 

liquidity risk management and governance 

liquidity risk is measured and managed by the funding and liquidity unit within our treasury unit in accordance with policy guidelines promulgated by our board and the asset liability committee in managing liquidity risk the funding and liquidity unit delivers regular and comprehensive reporting including current levels versus threshold limits for a broad set of liquidity metrics and early warning indicators explanatory commentary relating to emerging risk trends and as appropriate recommended remedial strategies 

our funding and liquidity unit’s primary goal is to deliver and otherwise maintain prudent levels of operating liquidity to support expected and projected funding requirements and contingent liquidity to support unexpected funding requirements resulting from idiosyncratic systemic and combination stress events and regulatory liquidity requirements in a timely manner from stable and costefficient funding sources 

we seek to accomplish this goal by funding loans with stable deposits by prudently controlling dependence on wholesale funding particularly shortterm unsecured funding and by maintaining ample available liquidity including a contingent liquidity buffer of unencumbered highquality loans and securities as of december 31 2020 

• core deposits continued to be our primary source of funding and our consolidated yearend loanstodeposits ratio which excludes lhfs was 836 

• our cash position which is defined as cash balance held at the frb totaled 117 billion 

• contingent liquidity was 473 billion consisting of unencumbered highquality liquid securities of 218 billion unused fhlb capacity of 139 billion and our cash position of 117 billion asset liquidity a component of contingent liquidity was 335 billion consisting of our cash position of 117 billion and unencumbered highquality liquid securities of 218 billion 

• available discount window capacity defined as available total borrowing capacity from the frb based on identified collateral is secured by nonmortgage commercial and retail loans and totaled 289 billion use of this borrowing capacity would be considered only during exigent circumstances and 

• for a summary of our sources and uses of cash by type of activity for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 see the consolidated statements of cash flows in item 8 

the funding and liquidity unit monitors a variety of liquidity and funding metrics and early warning indicators and metrics including specific risk thresholds limits these monitoring tools are broadly classified as follows 

• current liquidity sources and capacities including cash at the frbs free and liquid securities and available and secured fhlb borrowing capacity 

• liquidity stress sources including idiosyncratic systemic and combined stresses in addition to evolving regulatory requirements and 

• current and prospective exposures including secured and unsecured wholesale funding and spot and cumulative cashflow gaps across a variety of horizons 

further certain of these metrics are monitored individually for cbna and for our consolidated enterprise on a daily basis including cash position unencumbered securities asset liquidity and available fhlb borrowing capacity in order to identify emerging trends and risks and inform funding decisions specific metrics are also forecasted over a oneyear horizon

critical accounting estimates 

our audited consolidated financial statements which are included in this report are prepared in accordance with gaap the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to establish accounting policies and make estimates that affect amounts reported in our audited consolidated financial statements 

an accounting estimate requires assumptions and judgments about uncertain matters that could have a material effect on our audited consolidated financial statements estimates are made using facts and circumstances known at a point in time changes in those facts and circumstances could produce results substantially different from those estimates our most significant accounting policies and estimates and their related application are discussed below see note 1 in item 8 for further discussion of our significant accounting policies 

allowance for credit losses 

we reserve for expected credit losses on our loan and lease portfolio through the alll and for expected credit losses in our unfunded lending commitments through other liabilities collectively the alll and reserves for expected credit losses in unfunded lending commitments are referred to as the acl 

changes in the acl are reflected in net income through provision for credit losses changes in the credit risk profile of our loans and leases result in changes in provision expense with a resulting change net of chargeoffs and recoveries in the acl balance 

the acl is often the most critical of all the accounting estimates for banking institutions like us the acl is maintained at a level we believe to be appropriate to absorb expected lifetime credit losses over the contractual life of the loan and lease portfolios and on the unfunded lending commitments our determination of the acl is based on periodic evaluation of the loan and lease portfolios and unfunded lending commitments that are not unconditionally cancellable considering a number of relevant underlying factors including key assumptions and evaluation of quantitative and qualitative information 



key assumptions used in our acl measurement process include the use of a twoyear reasonable and supportable economic forecast period followed by a oneyear period during which the expected credit losses revert to longterm historical macroeconomic inputs 

the evaluation of quantitative and qualitative information is performed through assessments of groups of assets that share similar risk characteristics and certain individual loans and leases that do not share similar risk characteristics with the collective group loans are grouped generally by product type eg commercial and industrial commercial real estate residential mortgage etc and significant loan portfolios are assessed for credit losses using econometric models the evaluation process is inherently imprecise and subjective as it requires significant management judgment based on underlying factors that are susceptible to change sometimes materially and rapidly 

the quantitative evaluation of the adequacy of the acl utilizes a single economic forecast as its foundation and is primarily based on econometric models that use known or estimated data as of the balance sheet date and forecasted data over the reasonable and supportable period known and estimated data include current pd lgd and ead for commercial timing and amount of expected draws for unfunded lending commitments fico ltv term and time on books for retail loans mix and level of loan balances delinquency levels assigned risk ratings previous loss experience current business conditions amounts and timing of expected future cash flows and factors particular to a specific commercial credit such as competition business and management performance forwardlooking economic assumptions include real gross domestic product unemployment rate interest rate curve and changes in collateral values this data is aggregated to estimate expected credit losses over the contractual life of the loans and leases adjusted for expected prepayments in highly volatile economic environments historical information such as commercial customer financial statements or consumer credit ratings may not be as important to estimating future expected losses as forecasted inputs to the models 

the acl may also be affected materially by a variety of qualitative factors that we consider to reflect our current judgment of various events and risks that are not measured in our statistical procedures including uncertainty related to the economic forecasts used in the modeled credit loss estimates loan growth back testing results credit underwriting policy exceptions regulatory and audit findings and peer comparisons the qualitative allowance is further informed for certain industry sectors or loan classes by alternative scenarios to support the periodend acl balance we recognize that this approach may not be suitable in certain economic environments and differing analysis may be requested at management’s discretion due in part to its subjectivity the qualitative evaluation may be materially impacted during periods of economic uncertainty and late breaking events could lead to revision of reserves to reflect management’s best estimate of expected credit losses 

the measurement process results in specific or pooled allowances for loans leases and unfunded lending commitments and qualitative allowances that are judgmentally determined and applied across the portfolio 

there are certain loan portfolios that may not need an econometric model to enable us to calculate management’s best estimate of the expected credit losses less data intensive nonmodeled approaches to estimating losses are considered more efficient and practical for portfolios that have lower levels of outstanding balances eg runoff or closed portfolios and new products or products that are not significant to our overall credit risk exposure 

the difference in acl as of december 31 2020 as compared to december 31 2019 continues to be driven by the covid19 pandemic and associated lockdowns and the resulting economic impacts from march to december 31 2020 as well as our adoption of cecl on january 1 2020 we added 451 million in acl upon adoption of cecl and have added an additional 923 million over 2020 resulting in an ending acl balance of 27 billion 

to determine the acl as of december 31 2020 we utilized an economic scenario that generally reflects real gdp growth of approximately 4 over 2021 returning to fourth quarter 2019 real gdp levels by the last quarter of 2021 the scenario also projects the unemployment rate to be in the range of approximately 7 to 75 throughout 2021 while the macroeconomic forecast was slightly improved relative to the third quarter 2020 forecast we continued to apply management judgment to adjust the modeled reserves in the commercial industry sectors most impacted by the covid19 pandemic and associated lockdowns including retail and hospitality casual dining retail trade pricesensitive energy and related and educational services as well as in certain retail products 

our determination of the acl is sensitive to changes in forecasted macroeconomic conditions during the reasonable and supportable period to illustrate we applied a more pessimistic scenario than that described 



above which assumes vaccinations taking longer and covid19 cases being approximately 50 higher than our current expectations this pessimistic scenario reflects real gdp growth of approximately 25 and unemployment in the range of 8 to 85 over 2021 excluding consideration of qualitative adjustments this scenario would result in a quantitative lifetime loss estimate of approximately 12x our period end acl or an increase of 450 million 

because several quantitative and qualitative factors are considered in determining the acl this sensitivity analysis does not necessarily reflect the nature and extent of future changes in the acl or even what the acl would be under these economic circumstances the sensitivity is intended to provide insights into the impact of adverse changes in the macroeconomic environment and the corresponding impact to modeled loss estimates the hypothetical determination does not incorporate the impact of management judgment or other qualitative factors that could be applied in the actual estimation of the acl and does not imply any expectation of future deterioration in our loss rates 

to provide additional context regarding sensitivity to more pessimistic scenarios our acl balance of 27 billion represents 31 of the 86 billion of ninequarter losses projected in the federal reserve run of the december 2020 supervisory severely adverse scenario the “supervisory severely adverse scenario” which forecasted more protracted unemployment and gdp declines compared with our acl calculation our acl calculation also included the impacts of government stimulus 

comparatively our acl represents 53 of the 51 billion of projected losses in the company run results of the supervisory severely adverse scenario losses projected under the company run supervisory severely adverse scenario are lower than the federal reserve run results due to methodology and modeling differences as an example the federal reserve’s models did not recognize contractual loss sharing arrangements in the merchant loan portfolio in addition both the company run and federal reserve run results include incremental losses associated with loan originations assumed postjune 30 2020 in contrast our december 31 2020 acl balance considers only existing loans and lines of credit as of the reporting date 

while the recovery path is clearer than it was at the end of the third quarter 2020 significant future uncertainty still exists including size and timing of further monetary and fiscal stimulus and progress in the rollout of covid19related vaccines it remains difficult to estimate how changes in economic forecasts might affect our acl because such forecasts consider a wide variety of variables and inputs and changes in the variables and inputs may not occur at the same time or in the same direction and such changes may have differing impacts by product types further the variables and inputs may be idiosyncratically affected by existing or future monetary and fiscal stimulus programs and forbearance and other customer accommodation efforts nevertheless changes in one or multiple of the key variables may have a material impact to our estimation of expected credit losses 

we continue to monitor the impact of the covid19 pandemic vaccination efforts and related policy measures on the economy and the resulting potentially material effects on the acl

goodwill 

goodwill is initially recorded as the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired in a business combination and is assigned to our reporting units at the acquisition date our reporting units align to our operating segments identified in note 25 in item 8 we have identified and assigned goodwill totaling 71 billion at december 31 2020 to our reporting units as follows 23 billion to consumer banking and 48 billion to commercial banking 

goodwill is not amortized but is subject to annual impairment tests we review goodwill for impairment annually as of october 31 and in interim periods when events or changes indicate the carrying value of one or more reporting units may not be recoverable if it is more likely than not that the fair value exceeds the carrying value no further testing is necessary otherwise a quantitative assessment of goodwill is required 

the quantitative assessment used to identify potential impairment involves comparing each reporting unit’s fair value to its carrying value including goodwill if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value inclusive of goodwill the applicable goodwill is not considered impaired if the carrying value of the reporting unit inclusive of goodwill exceeds its fair value an impairment charge against net income is recorded equal to the excess amount under the quantitative impairment assessment the fair values of our reporting units are determined using a combination of income and marketbased approaches we rely on the income approach 



discounted cash flow method or “dcf” as our primary method to determine a range of values for each reporting unit with the market and transaction approaches used to inform management of the best estimate of value within that range 

significant management judgment is necessary in the determination of the fair value of a reporting unit as the income approach requires an estimation of future cash flows considering the aftertax results of operations the extent and timing of credit losses and appropriate discount and capital retention rates the determination of fair value is a highly subjective process and actual future cash flows may differ from forecasted results 

cash flow projections rely upon multiyear financial forecasts developed for each reporting unit that consider key business drivers such as new business initiatives customer retention standards market share changes anticipated loan and deposit growth fees and expenses forward interest rates historical performance credit performance and industry and economic trends among other considerations the longterm growth rate used in determining the terminal value of each reporting unit is estimated based on management’s assessment of the minimum expected terminal growth rate of each reporting unit as well as broader economic considerations such as gdp unemployment and inflation 

our discount rate was based on the estimated cost of equity under the capital asset pricing model which considers the riskfree interest rate market risk premium and beta specific to a particular reporting unit the discount rates are also calibrated on the assessment of the risks related to the projected cash flows of each reporting unit 

under the market approach valuation of our reporting units considers a combination of earnings and equity multiples from companies with characteristics similar to the reporting unit since the fair values determined under the market approach are representative of noncontrolling interests the valuations incorporate a control premium 

we performed our annual goodwill impairment assessment on a quantitative basis in the fourth quarter of 2020 when calculating the fair value of our reporting units under the income approach short and mediumterm forecasts incorporated current economic conditions and ongoing impacts of the covid19 pandemic and associated lockdowns including a federal funds target near zero and nearterm elevated acl offset by significant monetary and fiscal stimulus longterm cash flow projections reflected normalized rate and credit environments as well as a longterm rate of return for each reporting unit at the conclusion of the quantitative assessment it was determined that the estimated fair value of the commercial banking and consumer banking reporting units substantially exceed their carrying values due primarily to an improvement in the short and mediumterm economic forecasts 

when performing the quantitative goodwill impairment assessment in the fourth quarter of 2020 we corroborated the fair value of our reporting units determined by the dcf method by adding the aggregated sum of these fair value measurements to the fair value of our other nonsegment operations and comparing this total to our observed market capitalization the excess of the sum of the fair values of the reporting units over the market capitalization of citizens decreased from third quarter of 2020 to october 31 2020 and decreased significantly to december 31 2020 as our per share price rose from 2528 to 3576 the increase in our market capitalization resulted in a corresponding decrease in our implied control premium 

fair value 

we measure fair value of assets and liabilities using the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date fair value is also used on a recurring and nonrecurring basis to evaluate certain assets for impairment or for financial statement disclosure purposes examples of nonrecurring uses of fair value include impairment for certain loans leases and goodwill examples of recurring uses of fair value for financial statement disclosure purposes include disclosure of the fair value of certain financial assets and liabilities accounted for on an amortized cost basis such as htm securities for certain assets or liabilities the application of management judgment in the determination of the fair value is more significant due to the lack of observable market data 

msrs do not trade in an active market with readily observable prices msrs are classified as level 3 since the valuation methodology utilizes significant unobservable inputs the msr fair value was calculated using a discounted cash flow model which used assumptions including weightedaverage life prepayment assumptions and weightedaverage option adjusted spread it is important to note that changes in our assumptions may not be 



independent of each other changes in one assumption may result in changes to another eg changes in interest rates which are inversely correlated to changes in prepayment rates may result in changes to discount rates the underlying assumptions and estimated values are corroborated by values received from independent third parties based on their review of the servicing portfolio and comparisons to market transactions

risk governance 

we are committed to maintaining a strong integrated and proactive approach to the management of all risks to which we are exposed in pursuit of our business objectives a key aspect of our board’s responsibility as the main decision making body is setting our risk appetite to ensure that the levels of risk that we are willing to accept in the attainment of our strategic business and financial objectives are clearly understood 

to enable our board to carry out its objectives it has delegated authority for risk management activities as well as governance and oversight of those activities to a number of board and executive management level risk committees the executive risk committee “erc” chaired by the chief risk officer is responsible for oversight of risk across the enterprise and actively considers our inherent material risks analyzes our overall risk profile and seeks confirmation that the risks are being appropriately identified assessed and mitigated reporting to the erc are the following additional committees covering specific areas of risk compliance and operational risk committee model risk committee credit policy committee asset liability committee business initiatives review committee and the conduct and ethics committee 

risk framework 

our risk management framework is embedded in our business through a “three lines of defense” model which defines responsibilities and accountabilities for risk management activities 

first line of defense 

the business lines including their associated support functions are the first line of defense and are accountable for identifying assessing managing and controlling the risks associated with the products and services they provide the business lines are responsible for performing regular risk assessments to identify and assess the material risks that arise in their area of responsibility complying with relevant risk policies testing and certifying the adequacy and effectiveness of their operational and financial reporting controls on a regular basis establishing and documenting operating procedures and establishing and owning a governance structure for identifying and managing risk 

second line of defense 

the second line of defense includes independent monitoring and control functions accountable for developing and ensuring implementation of risk and control frameworks and related policies this centralized risk function is appropriately independent from the business and is accountable for overseeing and challenging our business lines on the effective management of their risks including credit market operational regulatory reputational interest rate liquidity and strategic risks 

third line of defense 

our internal audit function is the third line of defense providing independent assurance with a view of the effectiveness of our internal controls governance practices and culture so that risk is managed appropriately for the size complexity and risk profile of the organization internal audit has complete and unrestricted access to any and all of our records physical properties and personnel internal audit issues a report following each internal review and provides an audit opinion to the board’s audit committee on a quarterly basis 

credit quality assurance reports to the chief audit executive and provides the legalentity boards senior management and other stakeholders with independent assurance on the quality of credit portfolios and adherence to agreed credit risk appetite and credit policies and processes in line with its procedures and regulatory expectations the credit quality assurance function undertakes a program of portfolio testing assessing and reporting through four risk pillars of asset quality rating and data integrity risk management and credit risk appetite 



risk appetite 

risk appetite is a strategic business and risk management tool we define our risk appetite as the maximum limit of acceptable risk beyond which we could be unable to achieve our strategic objectives and capital adequacy obligations 

our principal nonmarket risks include credit operational regulatory reputational liquidity and strategic risks we are also subject to certain market risks which include potential losses arising from changes in interest rates foreign exchange rates equity prices commodity prices andor other relevant market rates or prices market risk in our business arises from trading activities that serve customer needs including hedging of interest rates foreign exchange risk and nontrading activities within capital markets we have established enterprisewide policies and methodologies to identify measure monitor and report on market risk we actively manage both trading and nontrading market risks see “—market risk” for further information our risk appetite is reviewed and approved annually by the board risk committee 

credit risk 

overview 

credit risk represents the potential for loss arising from a customer counterparty or issuer failing to perform in accordance with the contractual terms of the obligation while the majority of our credit risk is associated with lending activities we do engage with other financial counterparties for a variety of purposes including investing asset and liability management and trading activities given the financial impact of credit risk on our earnings and balance sheet the assessment approval and management of credit risk represents a major part of our overall riskmanagement responsibility 

objective 

the independent credit risk function is responsible for reviewing and approving credit risk appetite across all lines of business and credit products approving larger and higher risk credit transactions monitoring portfolio performance identifying problem credit exposures and ensuring remedial management 

organizational structure 

management and oversight of credit risk is the responsibility of both the business line and the second line of defense the second line of defense the independent credit risk function is led by the chief credit officer who oversees all of our credit risk the chief credit officer reports to the chief risk officer the chief credit officer acting in a manner consistent with board policies has responsibility for among other things the governance process around policies procedures risk acceptance criteria credit risk appetite limits and authority delegation the chief credit officer and team also have responsibility for credit approvals for larger and higher risk transactions and oversight of line of business credit risk activities reporting to the chief credit officer are the heads of the second line of defense credit functions specializing in consumer banking commercial banking citizens restructuring management portfolio and corporate reporting alll analytics current expected credit loss and credit policy and administration each team under these leaders is composed of highly experienced credit professionals 

governance 

the primary mechanisms used to govern our credit risk function are our consumer and commercial credit policies these policies outline the minimum acceptable lending standards that align with our desired risk appetite material changes in our business model and strategies that identify a need to change our risk appetite or highlight a risk not previously contemplated are identified by the individual committees and presented to the credit policy committee executive risk committee and the board risk committee for approval as appropriate 

key management processes 

we employ a comprehensive and integrated risk control program to proactively identify measure monitor and mitigate existing and emerging credit risks across the credit life cycle origination account managementportfolio management and loss mitigation and recovery 

consumer 

on the consumer banking side of credit risk our teams use models to evaluate consumer loans across the life cycle of the loan starting at origination credit scoring models are used to forecast the probability of default 



of an applicant when approving customers for a new loan or extension of an existing credit line credit scores are used in conjunction with other credit risk variables such as affordability length of term collateral value collateral type and lien subordination 

to ensure proper oversight of the underwriting teams lending authority is granted by the second line of defense credit risk function to each underwriter the amount of delegated authority depends on the experience of the individual we periodically evaluate the performance of each underwriter and annually reauthorize their delegated authority only senior members of the second line of defense credit risk team are authorized to approve significant exceptions to credit policies it is not uncommon to make exceptions to established policies when compensating factors are present there are exception limits which when reached trigger a comprehensive analysis 

once an account is established credit scores and collateral values are refreshed at regular intervals to allow for proactive identification of increasing or decreasing levels of credit risk our approach to managing credit risk is highly analytical and where appropriate is automated to ensure consistency and efficiency 

commercial 

on the commercial banking side of credit risk the structure is broken into ci loans leases and cre within ci loans and leases there are separate verticals established for certain specialty products eg assetbased lending leasing franchise finance health care technology and midcorporate a “specialty vertical” is a standalone team of industry or product specialists substantially all activity that falls under the ambit of the defined industry or product is managed through a specialty vertical when one exists cre also operates as a specialty vertical 

commercial credit risk management begins with defined credit products and policies 

commercial transactions are subject to individual analysis and approval at origination and with few exceptions are subject to a formal annual review requirement the underwriting process includes the establishment and approval of credit grades that confirm the pd and lgd all material transactions then require the approval of both a business line approver and an independent credit approver with the requisite level of delegated authority the approval level of a particular credit facility is determined by the size of the credit relationship as well as the pd the checks and balances in the credit process and the independence of the credit approver function are designed to appropriately assess and sanction the level of credit risk being accepted facilitate the early recognition of credit problems when they occur and to provide for effective problem asset management and resolution all authority to grant credit is delegated through the independent credit risk function and is closely monitored and regularly updated 

the primary factors considered in commercial credit approvals are the financial strength of the borrower assessment of the borrower’s management capabilities cash flows from operations industry sector trends type and sufficiency of collateral type of exposure transaction structure and the general economic outlook while these are the primary factors considered there are a number of other factors that may be considered in the decision process in addition to the credit analysis conducted during the approval process at origination and annual review our credit quality assurance group performs testing to provide an independent review and assessment of the quality of the portfolio and new originations this group conducts portfolio reviews on a riskbased cycle to evaluate individual loans and validate risk ratings as well as test the consistency of the credit processes and the effectiveness of credit risk management 

the maximum level of credit exposure to individual credit borrowers is limited by policy guidelines based on the perceived risk of each borrower or related group of borrowers concentration risk is managed through limits on industry asset class and loan quality factors we focus predominantly on extending credit to commercial customers with existing or expandable relationships within our primary markets for this purpose defined as our 11 state footprint plus contiguous states although we do engage in lending opportunities outside our primary markets if we believe that the associated risks are acceptable and aligned with strategic initiatives 

substantially all loans categorized as classified are managed by a specialized group of credit professionals 

market risk 

market risk refers to potential losses arising from changes in interest rates foreign exchange rates equity prices commodity prices andor other relevant market rates or prices modest market risk arises from trading activities that serve customer needs including hedging of interest rate and foreign exchange risk as 



described below more material market risk arises from our nontrading banking activities such as loan origination and depositgathering we have established enterprisewide policies and methodologies to identify measure monitor and report market risk we actively manage market risk for both trading and nontrading activities 

nontrading risk 

we are exposed to market risk as a result of nontrading banking activities this market risk is substantially composed of interest rate risk as we have no commodity risk and de minimis direct currency and equity risk we also have market risk related to capital markets loan originations as well as the valuation of our msrs 

interest rate risk 

interest rate risk emerges from the balance sheet after the aggregation of our assets liabilities and equity we refer to this nontrading risk embedded in the balance sheet as “structural interest rate risk” or “interest rate risk in the banking book” 

a major source of structural interest rate risk is a difference in the repricing of assets relative to liabilities and equity there are differences in the timing and drivers of rate changes reflecting the maturity andor repricing of assets and liabilities for example the rate earned on a commercial loan may reprice monthly with changes in libor while the rate paid on debt or certificates of deposit may be fixed for a longer period there may also be differences in the drivers of rate changes loans may be tied to a specific index rate such as libor or prime while deposits may be only loosely correlated with libor and dependent upon competitive demand due to these basis differences net interest income is sensitive to changes in spreads between certain indices or repricing rates 

another important source of structural interest rate risk relates to the potential exercise of explicit or embedded options for example most consumer loans can be prepaid without penalty and most consumer deposits can also be withdrawn without penalty the exercise of such options by customers can exacerbate the timing differences discussed above 

a primary source of our structural interest rate risk relates to faster repricing of floatingrate loans relative to core deposit funding this source of asset sensitivity is more biased toward the short end of the yield curve 

the secondary source of our interest rate risk is driven by longer term rates comprising the rollover or reinvestment risk on fixedrate loans as well as prepayment risk on mortgagerelated loans and securities funded by nonrate sensitive deposits and equity 

the primary goal of interest rate risk management is to control exposure to interest rate risk within policy limits approved by our board these limits and guidelines reflect our tolerance for interest rate risk over both shortterm and longterm horizons to ensure that exposure to interest rate risk is managed within our risk appetite we must measure the exposure and hedge it as necessary the treasury asset and liability management team is responsible for measuring monitoring and reporting on our structural interest rate risk position these exposures are reported on a monthly basis to the asset liability committee and at board meetings 

we measure structural interest rate risk through a variety of metrics intended to quantify both shortterm and longterm exposures the primary method we use to quantify interest rate risk is simulation analysis in which we model net interest income from assets liabilities and hedge derivative positions under various interest rate scenarios over a threeyear horizon exposure to interest rate risk is reflected in the variation of forecasted net interest income across the scenarios 

key assumptions in this simulation analysis relate to the behavior of interest rates and spreads the changes in product balances and the behavior of loan and deposit clients in different rate environments the most material of these behavioral assumptions relate to the repricing characteristics and balance fluctuations of deposits with indeterminate ie noncontractual maturities as well as the pace of mortgage prepayments assessments are periodically made by running sensitivity analyses to determine the impact of key assumptions the results of these analyses are reported to the asset liability committee 

as the future path of interest rates cannot be known in advance we use simulation analysis to project net interest income under various interest rate scenarios including a “most likely” implied forward scenario as well as a variety of deliberately extreme and perhaps unlikely scenarios these scenarios may assume gradual 



ramping of the overall level of interest rates immediate shocks to the level of rates and various yield curve twists in which movements in short or longterm rates predominate generally projected net interest income in any interest rate scenario is compared to net interest income in a base case where market forward rates are realized 

the table below reports net interest income exposures against a variety of interest rate scenarios our policies involve measuring exposures as a percentage change in net interest income over the next year due to either instantaneous or gradual parallel changes in rates relative to the market implied forward yield curve as the following table illustrates our balance sheet is assetsensitive net interest income would benefit from an increase in interest rates while exposure to a decline in interest rates is within limit while an instantaneous and severe shift in interest rates is included in this analysis we believe that any actual shift in interest rates would likely be more gradual and therefore have a more modest impact 



we continue to manage asset sensitivity within the scope of our policy and changing market conditions asset sensitivity against a 200 basis point gradual increase in rates was 108 at december 31 2020 compared with 32 at december 31 2019 current levels of asset sensitivity are elevated relative to our core sensitivity profile due to meaningful increases in cash and deposit balances as a result of monetary and fiscal stimulus programs this increase in asset sensitivity is recognition of the current level of historically low interest rates and is consistent with our positioning in prior periods of policy rates between zero and 25 basis points the risk position can be affected by changes in interest rates which impact the repricing sensitivity or beta of the deposit base as well as the cash flows on assets that allow for early payoff without a penalty the risk position is managed within our risk limits and long term view of interest rates through occasional adjustments to securities investments interest rate swaps and mix of funding 

we use a valuation measure of exposure to structural interest rate risk economic value of equity “eve” as a supplement to net interest income simulations eve complements net interest income simulation analysis as it estimates risk exposure over a longterm horizon eve measures the extent to which the economic value of assets liabilities and offbalance sheet instruments may change in response to fluctuations in interest rates this analysis is highly dependent upon assumptions applied to assets and liabilities with noncontractual maturities the change in value is expressed as a percentage of regulatory capital 

we use interest rate swap contracts to manage the interest rate exposure to variability in the interest cash flows on our floatingrate assets and floatingrate wholesale funding and to hedge market risk on fixedrate capital markets debt issuances 





1 includes 18 billion of forwardstarting payfixed interest rate swaps 

using the interest rate curve at december 31 2020 the estimated net contribution to net interest income related to the alm interest rate swap contracts we use to manage the interest rate exposure to the variability in the interest cash flows on our floatingrate commercial loans and floatingrate wholesale funding as well as the variability in the fair value of afs securities is approximately 58 million for the fullyear 2021 this amount could differ from amounts actually recognized due to changes in interest rates hedge dedesignations and the addition of other hedges subsequent to december 31 2020 



libor transition 

as previously disclosed many of our lending products securities derivatives and other financial transactions utilize the libor benchmark rate and will be impacted by its planned discontinuance in late 2018 we formed a libor transition program designed to guide the organization through the planned discontinuation of libor the program with direction and oversight from our chief financial officer is responsible for developing maintaining and executing against a coordinated strategy to ensure a timely and orderly transition from libor the program is structured to address various initiatives including program governance transition management communications exposure management new alternative reference rate product delivery risk management contract remediation operations and technology readiness accounting and reporting as well as tax and regulation impacts we have identified and are monitoring the risks associated with the libor transition on a quarterly basis 

the arrc recommended that banks be systemically and operationally capable of supporting transactions in alternative reference rates such as sofr by the end of september 2020 guided by this milestone we are systemically and operationally prepared to support alternative reference rate transactions in light of announcements from the ice benchmark administration regarding their proposal to extend the availability of us dollar libor for most tenors through june 20 2023 and the support for this proposal from the official sector in the us we are now engaged in determining the impact that this change may have on our libor transition activities remaining mindful that regulators are still urging market participants to stop entering into new us dollar libor contracts as soon as practicable but no later than the end of 2021 we will continue all efforts to move new originations to alternative reference rates over the course of 2021 however plans for legacy contract remediation will extend through mid2023 should the proposal become final in its current form more broadly program governance remains robust and progress has been made in the aboveoutlined initiatives as management closely monitors the consultations and waits for timelines to be finalized 



for a further discussion of how the discontinuance of libor may impact our business see item 1a “risk factors 

capital markets 

a key component of our capital markets activities is the underwriting and distribution of corporate credit facilities to partially finance mergers and acquisitions transactions for our clients we have a rigorous risk management process around these activities including a limit structure capping our underwriting risk our potential loss and sublimits for specific asset classes further the ability to approve underwriting exposure is delegated only to senior level individuals in the credit risk management and capital markets organizations with each transaction adjudicated in the loan underwriting approval committee 

mortgage servicing rights 

we have market risk associated with the value of residential msrs which are impacted by various types of inherent risks including risks related to duration basis convexity volatility and yield curve through december 31 2019 we had elected to account for the msrs acquired from famc at fair value while maintaining a lower of cost or market approach on our msrs held before the famc acquisition on january 1 2020 we elected to change our accounting treatment such that all msrs will be accounted for at fair value 

as part of our overall risk management strategy relative to the fair market value of the msrs we enter into various freestanding derivatives such as interest rate swaps interest rate swaptions interest rate futures and forward contracts to purchase mortgagebacked securities to economically hedge the changes in fair value as of december 31 2020 and 2019 the fair value of our msrs was 658 million and 642 million respectively and the total notional amount of related derivative contracts was 114 billion and 86 billion respectively gains and losses on msrs and the related derivatives used for hedging are included in mortgage banking fees on the consolidated statements of operations 

as with our traded market riskbased activities earnings at risk excludes the impact of msrs msrs are captured under our single price risk management framework that is used for calculating a management value at risk that is consistent with the definition used by banking regulators as defined below 

trading risk 

we are exposed to market risk primarily through client facilitation activities including derivatives and foreign exchange products as well as corporate bond underwriting and market making activities exposure is created as a result of changes in interest rates and related basis spreads and volatility foreign exchange rates and credit spreads on a select range of interest rates foreign exchange commodities corporate bonds and secondary loan instruments these trading activities are conducted through cbna and ccmi 

client facilitation activities consist primarily of interest rate derivatives financially settled commodity derivatives and foreign exchange contracts where we enter into offsetting trades with a separate counterparty or exchange to manage our market risk exposure in addition to the aforementioned activities we operate a secondary loan trading desk with the objective to meet secondary liquidity needs of our issuing clients’ transactions and investor clients we do not engage in any trading activities with the intent to benefit from shortterm price differences 

we record these rate derivatives and foreign exchange contracts as derivative assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets trading assets and liabilities are carried at fair value with income earned related to these activities included in net interest income changes in fair value of trading assets and liabilities are reflected in other income a component of noninterest income on the consolidated statements of operations 

market risk governance 

the market risk limit setting process is established inline with the formal enterprise risk appetite process and policy this appetite reflects the strategic and enterprise level articulation of opportunities for creating franchise value set to the boundaries of how much market risk to assume dealing authorities represent the key control tool in the management of market risk that allows the cascading of the risk appetite throughout the enterprise a dealing authority sets the operational scope and tolerances within which a business andor trading desk is permitted to operate which is reviewed at least annually dealing authorities are structured to accommodate client facing trades and hedges needed to manage the risk profile primary responsibility for keeping within established tolerances resides with the business key risk indicators including var open foreign 



currency positions and single name risk are monitored on a daily basis and reported against tolerances consistent with our risk appetite and business strategy to relevant business line management and risk counterparts 

market risk measurement 

we use var as a statistical measure for estimating potential exposure of our traded market risk in normal market conditions our var framework for risk management and regulatory reporting is the same risk management var is based on a one day holding period to a 99 confidence level whereas regulatory var is based on a ten day holding period to the same confidence level in addition to var nonstatistical measurements for measuring risk are employed such as sensitivity analysis market value and stress testing 

our market risk platform and associated market risk and valuation models capture correlation effects across all our “covered positions” and allow for aggregation of market risk across products risk types business lines and legal entities we measure monitor and report market risk for both management and regulatory capital purposes 

var overview 

the market risk measurement model is based on historical simulation the var measure estimates the extent of any fair value losses on trading positions that may occur due to broad market movements general var such as changes in the level of interest rates foreign exchange rates equity prices and commodity prices it is calculated on the basis that current positions remain broadly unaltered over the course of a given holding period it is assumed that markets are sufficiently liquid to allow the business to close its positions if required within this holding period var’s benefit is that it captures the historic correlations of a portfolio based on the composition of our “covered positions” we also use a standardized addon approach for the loan trading and high yield bond desks’ specific risk capital which estimates the extent of any losses that may occur from factors other than broad market movements the general var approach is expressed in terms of a confidence level over the past 500 trading days the internal var measure used as the basis of the main var trading limits is a 99 confidence level with a one day holding period meaning that a loss greater than the var is expected to occur on average on only one day in 100 trading days ie 1 of the time theoretically there should be a loss event greater than var two to three times per year the regulatory measure of var is done at a 99 confidence level with a tenday holding period the historical market data applied to calculate the var is updated on a two business day lag refer to “market risk regulatory capital” below for details of our tenday var metrics for the quarters ended december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively including high low average and period end var for interest rate and foreign exchange rate risks as well as total var 



market risk regulatory capital 

the us banking regulators’ “market risk rule” covers the calculation of market risk capital for the purposes of the market risk rule all of our client facing trades and associated hedges maintain a net low risk and do qualify as “covered positions” the internal management var measure is calculated based on the same population of trades that is utilized for regulatory var

svar is an extension of var but uses a longer historical lookback horizon that is fixed from january 3 2005 this is done not only to identify headline risks from more volatile periods but also to provide a counterbalance to var which may be low during periods of low volatility the holding period for profit and loss determination is ten days in addition to risk management purposes svar is also a component of market risk regulatory capital we calculate svar daily under its own dynamic window regime in a dynamic window regime values of the tenday 99 var are calculated over all possible 260day periods that can be obtained from the complete historical data set refer to “market risk regulatory capital” above for details of svar metrics including high low average and period end svar for the combined portfolio 

sensitivity analysis 

sensitivity analysis is the measure of exposure to a single risk factor such as a one basis point change in rates or credit spread we conduct and monitor sensitivity on interest rates basis spreads foreign exchange exposures option prices and credit spreads whereas var is based on previous moves in market risk factors over recent periods it may not be an accurate predictor of future market moves sensitivity analysis complements var as it provides an indication of risk relative to each factor irrespective of historical market moves and is an effective tool in evaluating the appropriateness of hedging strategies and concentrations 

stress testing 

conducting a stress test of a portfolio consists of running risk models with the inclusion of key variables that simulate various historical or hypothetical scenarios for historical stress tests profit and loss results are simulated for selected time periods corresponding to the most volatile underlying returns while hypothetical stress tests aim to consider concentration risk illiquidity under stressed market conditions and risk arising from our trading activities that may not be fully captured by our other risk measurement methodologies hypothetical scenarios also assume that market moves happen simultaneously and no repositioning or hedging activity takes place to mitigate losses as market events unfold we generate stress tests of our trading positions on a daily basis for example we currently include a stress test that simulates a “lehmantype” crisis scenario by taking 



the worst 20trading day peak to trough moves for the various risk factors that go into var from that period and assumes they occurred simultaneously 

var model review and validation 

market risk measurement models used are independently reviewed and subject to ongoing performance analysis by the model owners the independent review and validation focuses on the model methodology market data and performance independent review of market risk measurement models is the responsibility of citizens’ model risk management and validation team aspects covered include challenging the assumptions used the quantitative techniques employed and the theoretical justification underpinning them and an assessment of the soundness of the required data over time where possible the quantitative impact of the major underlying modeling assumptions will be estimated eg through developing alternative models results of such reviews are shared with our us banking regulators the market risk models may be periodically enhanced due to changes in market price levels and price action regime behavior the market risk management and validation team will conduct internal validation before a new or changed model element is implemented and before a change is made to a market data mapping 

var backtesting 

backtesting is one form of validation of the var model and is run daily the market risk rule requires a comparison of our internal var measure to the actual net trading revenue excluding fees commissions reserves intraday trading and net interest income for each day over the preceding year the most recent 250 business days any observed loss in excess of the var number is taken as an exception the level of exceptions determines the multiplication factor used to derive the var and svarbased capital requirement for regulatory reporting purposes when applicable we perform subportfolio backtesting as required under the market risk rule using models approved by our banking regulators for interest rate credit spread and foreign exchange positions 

the following graph shows our daily net trading revenue and total internal modeled var for the year ended december 31 2020

maintain a highperforming customercentric organization to accomplish this we continually strive to enhance our “customerfirst” culture in order to deliver the best possible banking experience recently we launched a new companywide branding campaign ‘made ready’ which is centered around our focus on delivering personalized and distinctive experiences for colleagues we are taking talent management to the next level with a goal of attracting developing and retaining great people while ensuring strong leadership teamwork and a sense of empowerment accountability and urgency 

develop differentiated value propositions to acquire deepen and retain core customer segments we have focused on certain customer segments where we believe we are well positioned to compete in consumer banking we focus on serving mass affluent and affluent customers and small business customers in commercial banking we focus on serving customers in the middle market midcorporate and certain industry vertical areas by developing differentiated and targeted value propositions we believe we can attract new customers deepen relationships with existing customers and deliver an enhanced customer experience

competition 

the financial services industry is highly competitive our branch footprint is in the new england midatlantic and midwest regions though certain lines of business serve national markets within these markets we face competition from community banks superregional and national financial institutions credit unions savings and loan associations mortgage banking firms consumer finance companies securities brokerage firms insurance companies money market funds hedge funds and private equity firms some of our larger competitors may make available to their customers a broader array of products pricing and structure alternatives while some smaller competitors may have more liberal lending policies and processes competition among providers of financial products and services continues to increase with consumers having the opportunity to select from a growing variety of traditional and nontraditional alternatives the ability of nonbanking financial institutions including fintech companies to provide services previously limited to commercial banks has also intensified competition 

in consumer banking the industry has become increasingly dependent on and oriented toward technologydriven delivery systems permitting transactions to be conducted through telephone online and mobile channels in addition technology has lowered barriers to entry and made it possible for nonbank institutions to attract funds and provide lending and other financial products and services the emergence of digitalonly banking models has increased and we expect this trend to continue given their lower cost structure these models are often on average able to offer higher rates on deposit products than retail banking institutions with a traditional branch footprint the primary factors driving competition for loans and deposits are interest rates fees charged tailored value propositions to different customer segments customer service levels convenience including branch locations and hours of operation and the range of products and services offered 

in commercial banking there is intense competition for quality loan originations from traditional banking institutions particularly large regional banks as well as commercial finance companies leasing companies and other nonbank lenders and institutional investors including clo managers hedge funds and private equity firms some larger competitors including certain national banks that compete in our market area may offer a broader array of products and due to their asset size may sometimes be in a position to hold more exposure on their own balance sheet we compete on a number of factors including providing innovative corporate finance solutions quality of customer service and execution range of products offered price and reputation 

regulation and supervision 

our operations are subject to extensive regulation supervision and examination under federal and state laws and regulations these laws and regulations cover all aspects of our business including lending practices deposit insurance customer privacy and cybersecurity capital adequacy and planning liquidity safety and soundness consumer protection and disclosure permissible activities and investments and certain transactions with affiliates these laws and regulations are intended primarily for the protection of depositors the deposit insurance fund and the banking system as a whole and not for the protection of shareholders or other investors the discussion below outlines the material elements of selected laws and regulations applicable to us and our subsidiaries changes in applicable law or regulation and in their interpretation and application by regulatory agencies and other governmental authorities cannot be predicted but may have a material effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

we and our subsidiaries are subject to examinations by federal and state banking regulators as well as the sec finra and various state insurance and securities regulators in some cases regulatory agencies may take supervisory actions that may not be publicly disclosed and such actions may restrict or limit our activities or activities of our subsidiaries as part of our regular examination process regulators may advise us to operate under various restrictions as a prudential matter we have periodically received requests for information from regulatory authorities at the federal and state level including from banking securities and insurance regulators state attorneys general federal agencies or law enforcement authorities and other regulatory authorities concerning our business practices such requests are considered incidental to the normal conduct of business for a further discussion of how regulatory actions may impact our business see item 1a “risk factors” for additional information regarding regulatory and supervisory matters see note 24 in item 8 

overview 

we are a bank holding company under the bank holding company act we have elected to be treated as a financial holding company under amendments to the bank holding company act as effected by glba as such we are subject to the supervision examination and reporting requirements of the bank holding company act and the regulations of the frb including through the federal reserve bank of boston under the system of “functional regulation” established under the bank holding company act the frb serves as the primary regulator of our 



consolidated organization and the sec serves as the primary regulator of our brokerdealer and investment advisory subsidiaries and directly regulates the activities of those subsidiaries with the frb exercising a supervisory role 

the federal banking regulators have authority to approve or disapprove mergers acquisitions consolidations the establishment of branches and similar corporate actions these banking regulators also have the power to prevent the continuance or development of unsafe or unsound banking practices or other violations of law federal law governs the activities in which cbna engages including the investments it makes and the aggregate amount of available credit that it may grant to one borrower various consumer and compliance laws and regulations also affect its operations the actions the frb takes to implement monetary policy also affect cbna 

in addition cbna is subject to regulation supervision and examination by the cfpb with respect to consumer protection laws and regulations the cfpb has broad authority to regulate the offering and provision of consumer financial products by depository institutions such as cbna with more than 10 billion in total assets the cfpb may promulgate rules under a variety of consumer financial protection statutes including the truth in lending act the electronic funds transfer act and the real estate settlement procedures act 

tailoring of prudential requirements 

in october 2019 the frb and the other federal banking regulators finalized rules that tailor the application of the enhanced prudential standards to bank holding companies and depository institutions to implement the economic growth regulatory relief and consumer protection act of 2018 “egrrcpa” amendments to the doddfrank act “tailoring rules” the tailoring rules assign each us bank holding company with 100 billion or more in total consolidated assets as well as its bank subsidiaries to one of four categories based on its size and five other riskbased indicators 

i crossjurisdictional activity 

ii weighted shortterm wholesale funding “wstwf” 

iii nonbank assets 

iv offbalance sheet exposure and 

v status as a us globally systematically important bank 

under the tailoring rules we are subject to “category iv standards” which apply to banking organizations with at least 100 billion in total consolidated assets that do not meet any of the thresholds specified for categories i through iii accordingly category iv firms such as us 

 ii remain not subject to advanced approaches capital requirements 

 iv remain not subject to the supplementary leverage ratio 

v remain not subject to the countercyclical capital buffer 

vi are no longer subject to companyrun stress testing requirements 

vii became subject to supervisory stress testing on a biennial instead of annual basis 

viii remain subject to requirements to develop and maintain a capital plan on an annual basis and 

ix remain subject to certain liquidity risk management and risk committee requirements 

we discuss other elements of the tailoring rules where relevant below the liquidity requirements are described below under “—liquidity requirements” and their stress testing requirements are described below under “—capital planning and stress testing requirements” in addition the resolution planning requirements implemented by the frb and fdic are described below under “—resolution planning” 

many of the provisions of the egrrcpa and other laws are subject to further rulemaking guidance and interpretation by the applicable federal regulators the ultimate effects of egrrcpa and the tailoring rules on us and our activities will be subject to any additional rule making issued by the frb and other federal regulators we will continue to evaluate the impact of any changes in law and any new regulations promulgated including changes 



in regulatory costs and fees modifications to consumer products or disclosures required by the cfpb and the requirements of the enhanced supervision provisions among others 

financial holding company regulation 

the bank holding company act generally restricts bank holding companies from engaging in business activities other than banking managing or controlling banks furnishing services to or performing services for subsidiaries and activities that the frb has determined to be closely related to banking for so long as they continue to meet the eligibility requirements for financial holding company status financial holding companies may engage in a broader range of activities including securities underwriting and dealing insurance underwriting and brokerage merchant banking and other activities that are determined by the frb in coordination with the treasury department to be “financial in nature or incidental thereto” or that the frb determines unilaterally to be “complementary” to financial activities in addition a financial holding company may conduct permissible new financial activities or acquire permissible nonbank financial companies with afterthefact notice to the frb 

as noted above we currently have elected to be treated as a financial holding company under amendments to the bank holding company act as effected by glba to maintain financial holding company status a financial holding company and all of its insured depository institution subsidiaries must remain well capitalized and well managed as described below under “federal deposit insurance act” and maintain a cra rating of at least “satisfactory” see “community reinvestment act requirements” below if a financial holding company ceases to meet the capital and management requirements the frb’s regulations provide that the financial holding company must enter into an agreement with the frb to comply with all applicable capital and management requirements until the financial holding company returns to compliance the frb may impose limitations or conditions on the conduct of its activities and the company may not commence any of the broader financial activities permissible for financial holding companies or acquire a company engaged in such financial activities without prior approval of the frb in addition the failure to meet such requirements could result in other material restrictions on the activities of the financial holding company may also adversely affect the financial holding company’s ability to enter into certain transactions including acquisition transactions or obtain necessary approvals in connection therewith and may result in the bank holding company losing financial holding company status any restrictions imposed on our activities by the frb may not necessarily be made known to the public if the company does not return to compliance within 180 days which period may be extended the frb may require the financial holding company to divest its subsidiary depository institutions or to discontinue or divest investments in companies engaged in activities permissible only for a bank holding company electing to be treated as a financial holding company if any insured depository institution subsidiary of a financial holding company fails to maintain a cra rating of at least “satisfactory” the financial holding company would be subject to restrictions on certain new activities and acquisitions bank holding companies and banks must also be both well capitalized and well managed in order to acquire banks located outside their home state 

capital 

the us basel iii rules apply to us these rules establish riskbased and leverage capital requirements the riskbased requirements are based on a banking organization’s riskweighted assets also known as rwa which reflect the organization’s on and offbalance sheet exposures subject to risk weights the leverage requirements are based on a banking organization’s average consolidated onbalance sheet assets for more detail on our regulatory capital see the “capital and regulatory matters” section of item 7 

we calculate rwa using the standardized approach and have made the onetime election to optout of aoci as a result we are not required to recognize in regulatory capital the impacts of net unrealized gains and losses included within aoci for debt securities that are available for sale or held to maturity accumulated net gains and losses on cash flow hedges and certain defined benefit pension plan assets 

under the us basel iii rules the minimum capital ratios are 

• 45 cet1 capital to riskweighted assets 

• 60 tier 1 capital that is cet1 capital plus additional tier 1 capital to riskweighted assets 

• 80 total capital that is tier 1 capital plus tier 2 capital to riskweighted assets and 



 

the us basel iii rules also impose a capital conservation buffer “ccb” of 25 on top of each of the three minimum riskweighted asset ratios listed above banking institutions that fail to meet the effective minimum ratios with the ccb taken into account will be subject to constraints on capital distributions including dividends and share repurchases and certain discretionary executive compensation the severity of the constraints depends on the amount of the shortfall and the institution’s “eligible retained income” defined as four quarter trailing net income net of distributions and tax effects not reflected in net income for more details see the “capital and regulatory matters” section of item 7 

in april 2018 the frb issued a proposal designed to create a single integrated capital requirement by combining the quantitative assessment of firms’ capital plans with the ccb requirement details of this proposal are discussed under “—capital planning and stress testing requirements” below although the proposal if adopted would change the way in which the minimum capital ratios are calculated firms would continue to be subject to progressively more stringent constraints on capital actions as they approach the minimum ratios 

we are also subject to the frbs riskbased capital requirements for market risk see the “market risk” section of item 7 

in july 2019 the frb and the other federal banking regulators issued a final rule to simplify regulatory capital treatment for msrs certain dtas and significant investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions pursuant to egrrcpa effective for us on april 1 2020 the final rule will change the individual cet1 deduction threshold for these assets from 10 to 25 eliminate the aggregate deduction threshold for these assets of 15 assign a 250 risk weight for any msrs or dtas not deducted from cet1 capital and assign an exposure category risk weight for investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions not deducted from cet1 capital 

liquidity requirements 

the federal banking regulators have adopted the basel iiibased us lcr rule which is a quantitative liquidity metric designed to ensure that a covered bank or bank holding company maintains an adequate level of unencumbered highquality liquid assets to cover expected net cash outflows over a 30day time horizon under an acute liquidity stress scenario as noted above under the tailoring rules category iv firms with less than 50 billion in wstwf including us are no longer subject to any lcr requirement 

the basel iii framework also includes a second liquidity standard the nsfr which is designed to promote more medium and longterm funding of the assets and activities of banks over a oneyear time horizon in may 2016 the federal banking regulators issued a proposed rule that would implement the nsfr for large us banking organizations under the 2016 proposal bank holding companies with 50 billion or more in total consolidated assets but that are not advanced approaches bank holding companies including us would have been subject to a modified less stringent nsfr requirement although the nsfr has not been finalized it is expected that the framework for applying any finalized nsfr will be consistent with the approach for the lcr requirement under the tailoring rules 

finally per the liquidity rules included in the frb’s enhanced prudential standards adopted pursuant to section 165 of the doddfrank act referred to above under “—tailoring of prudential requirements” we are also required to maintain a buffer of highly liquid assets based on projected funding needs for 30 days under the tailoring rules the liquidity buffer requirements continue to apply to category iv firms such as us and remain subject to liquidity risk management requirements however these requirements are now tailored such that we required to 

i calculate collateral positions monthly as opposed to weekly 

ii establish a more limited set of liquidity risk limits than was previously required and 

iii monitor fewer elements of intraday liquidity risk exposures than were previously monitored 

we are also now subject to liquidity stress testing quarterly rather than monthly and are required to report liquidity data on a monthly basis 

  capital planning and stress testing requirements 

under the final tailoring rules implementing the egrrcpa category iv firms with 100 billion to 250 billion in total assets including us are no longer required to conduct and publicly disclose results of the companyrun stress tests and are subject to supervisory stress testing on a twoyear rather than an annual basis category iv firms continue to be subject to the requirement to submit an annual capital plan that must be reviewed and approved 



by the firm’s board of directors or one of its committees at least annually as well as fr y14 reporting requirements in connection with the final tailoring rules the frb noted that it intends to propose changes to the capital plan rule including providing firms subject to category iv standards additional flexibility to develop their annual plans 

in february 2019 the frb provided relief to a number of bhcs with assets between 100 billion and 250 billion in assets including us from certain regulatory requirements related to supervisory stress testing and companyrun stress testing and related disclosure requirements for the 2019 stress test cycle as a result we were not required to participate in the supervisory stress test or ccar conduct companyrun stress tests or submit a capital plan to the frb for 2019 as required we submitted our planned capital actions for the period beginning july 1 2019 and ending june 30 2020 to the frb consistent with the frb authorization our planned capital actions for the four quarters ending june 30 2020 are largely based on the results for our 2018 supervisory stress test adjusted for any changes in our regulatory capital ratios since the frb acted on our 2018 capital plan we are required to submit a capital plan to the frb on or before april 5 2020 

as noted above the frb’s april 2018 proposal to create a single integrated capital requirement by combining the quantitative assessment of ccar with the ccb requirement would if adopted replace the current static 25 ccb with a firmspecific stress capital buffer “scb” requirement the scb subject to a minimum of 25 would reflect stressed losses in the supervisory severely adverse scenario of the frb’s supervisory stress tests and would also include four quarters of planned common stock dividends the proposal would also introduce a stress leverage buffer “slb” requirement similar to the scb which would apply to the tier 1 leverage ratio in addition the proposal would eliminate the quantitative objection provisions of ccar but would require a bank holding company to reduce its planned capital distributions if those distributions would not be consistent with the applicable capital buffer constraints based on the bank holding company’s own baseline scenario projections the frb is reconsidering several aspects of the scb proposal including the fourquarter dividend addon the slb requirement yeartoyear volatility and alignment with the twoyear supervisory stress testing cycle for category iv bank holding companies as is currently the case under the proposal a bank holding company subject to ccar would generally not be permitted to exceed the capital distributions reflected in its capital plan either on a gross basis or net of capital issuances without prior approval of the frb 

resolution planning 

under section 165 of the doddfrank act as amended by egrrcpa certain bank holding companies must submit a periodic resolution plan to the frb and fdic providing for the company’s strategy for rapid and orderly resolution in the event of its material financial distress or failure we submitted our most recent resolution plan to the frb and fdic in december 2016 however in october 2019 in connection with the release of the tailoring rules the frb and fdic issued final rules which adjusted the scope and applicability of the agencies’ resolution planning requirements under these new rules category iv bank holding companies such as us are no longer required to submit resolution plans 

the fdic has separately implemented a resolution planning rule that currently requires insured depository institutions of 50 billion or more in total assets such as cbna to periodically submit a resolution plan in april 2019 the fdic released an advance notice of proposed rulemaking regarding potential changes to its resolution planning requirements for insured depository institutions such as cbna and the next round of insured depository institution resolution plan submissions will not be required until the rulemaking process is complete cbna submitted its most recent resolution plan to the fdic in july 2018 

standards for safety and soundness 

the fdia requires the frb occ and fdic to prescribe operational and managerial standards for all insured depository institutions including cbna the agencies have adopted regulations and interagency guidelines that set forth the safety and soundness standards used to identify and address problems at insured depository institutions before capital becomes impaired if an agency determines that a bank fails to satisfy any standard it may require the bank to submit an acceptable plan to achieve compliance consistent with deadlines for the submission and review of such safety and soundness compliance plans if after being notified to submit a compliance plan an institution fails to submit an acceptable compliance plan or fails in any material respect to implement an acceptable compliance plan the agency must issue an order directing action to correct the deficiency and may issue an order directing other actions of the types to which an undercapitalized institution is subject under the fdia see “federal deposit insurance act” below if an institution fails to comply with such an order the agency may seek to enforce such order in judicial proceedings and to impose civil money penalties 



federal deposit insurance act 

the fdia requires among other things that the federal banking regulators take “prompt corrective action” with respect to depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements as described above in “capital” the fdia sets forth the following five capital categories “wellcapitalized” “adequately capitalized” “undercapitalized” “significantly undercapitalized” and “critically undercapitalized” a depository institution’s capital category depends upon how its capital levels compare with various relevant capital measures and certain other factors that are established by regulation the federal banking regulators must take certain mandatory supervisory actions and are authorized to take other discretionary actions with respect to institutions that are undercapitalized significantly undercapitalized or critically undercapitalized with the actions becoming more restrictive and punitive the lower the institution’s capital category under existing rules an institution that is not an advanced approaches institution is deemed to be “well capitalized” if it has a cet1 ratio of at least 65 a tier 1 capital ratio of at least 8 a total capital ratio of at least 10 and a tier 1 leverage ratio of at least 5 

the fdia’s prompt corrective action provisions only apply to depository institutions and not to bank holding companies the frb’s regulations applicable to bank holding companies separately define “well capitalized” for bank holding companies to require maintaining a tier 1 capital ratio of at least 6 and a total capital ratio of at least 10 as described above under “—financial holding company regulation” a financial holding company that is not wellcapitalized and wellmanaged or whose bank subsidiaries are not well capitalized and well managed under applicable prompt corrective action standards may be restricted in certain of its activities and ultimately may lose financial holding company status as of december 31 2019 the parent company and cbna were wellcapitalized 

the fdia prohibits insured banks from accepting brokered deposits or offering interest rates on any deposits significantly higher than the prevailing rate in the bank’s normal market area or nationally depending upon where the deposits are solicited unless it is “wellcapitalized” or it is “adequately capitalized” and receives a waiver from the fdic a bank that is “adequately capitalized” and that accepts brokered deposits under a waiver from the fdic may not pay an interest rate on any deposit in excess of 75 basis points over certain prevailing market rates the fdia imposes no such restrictions on a bank that is “wellcapitalized” 

deposit insurance 

the fdia requires cbna to pay deposit insurance assessments fdic assessment rates for large institutions are calculated based on one of two scorecards one for most large institutions that have more than 10 billion in assets and another for “highly complex” institutions that have over 50 billion in assets and are fully owned by a parent with over 500 billion in assets each scorecard has a performance score and a lossseverity score that are combined to produce a total score which is translated into an initial assessment rate in calculating these scores the fdic utilizes the camels ratings and forwardlooking financial measures to assess an institution’s ability to withstand assetrelated stress and fundingrelated stress the fdic has the ability to make discretionary adjustments to the total score based upon significant risk factors that are not adequately captured in the scorecard the total score is then translated to an initial base assessment rate on a nonlinear sharplyincreasing scale 

the deposit insurance assessment is calculated based on average consolidated total assets less average tangible equity of the insured depository institution during the assessment period deposit insurance assessments are also affected by the minimum reserve ratio with respect to the deposit insurance fund “dif” the fdia established a minimum reserve ratio of the dif of 115 prior to september 2020 and 135 thereafter as of september 30 2019 the reserve ratio of the dif reached 141 

dividends 

various federal statutory provisions and regulations as well as regulatory expectations limit the amount of dividends that we and our subsidiaries may pay 

our payment of dividends to our stockholders is subject to the oversight of the frb in particular the frb reviews the dividend policies and share repurchases of a large bank holding company based on capital plans submitted as part of the ccar process and on the results of stress tests as discussed above in addition to other limitations our ability to make any capital distributions including dividends and share repurchases is contingent on the frb’s nonobjection to such planned distributions included in our submitted capital plan or the frb’s authorization to make distributions if we are exempt from the requirement to submit a capital plan see “—capital” and “—capital planning and stress testing requirements” above 

dividends payable by cbna as a national bank subsidiary are limited to the lesser of the amount calculated under a “recent earnings” test and an “undivided profits” test under the recent earnings test a dividend may not be paid if the total of all dividends declared by a bank in any calendar year is in excess of the current year’s net 



income combined with the retained net income of the two preceding years less any required transfers to surplus unless the national bank obtains the approval of the occ under the undivided profits test a dividend may not be paid in excess of the entity’s “undivided profits” generally accumulated net profits that have not been paid out as dividends or transferred to surplus federal bank regulatory agencies have issued policy statements that provide that fdicinsured depository institutions and their holding companies should generally pay dividends only out of their current operating earnings 

support of subsidiary bank 

under section 616 of the doddfrank act which codifies the frb’s longstanding “source of strength” doctrine the parent company must serve as a source of financial and managerial strength for our depository institution subsidiary the statute defines “source of financial strength” as the ability to provide financial assistance in the event of the financial distress at the insured depository institution the frb may require that the parent company provide such support at times even when the parent company may not have the financial resources to do so or when doing so may not serve our interests or those of our shareholders or creditors in addition any capital loans by a bank holding company to its subsidiary bank are subordinate in right of payment to deposits and to certain other indebtedness of such subsidiary bank in the event of a bank holding company’s bankruptcy any commitment by the bank holding company to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to a priority of payment 

transactions with affiliates and insiders 

sections 23a and 23b of the federal reserve act and related frb rules including regulation w restrict cbna from extending credit to or engaging in certain other transactions with the parent company and its nonbank subsidiaries these restrictions place limits on certain specified “covered transactions” between bank subsidiaries and their affiliates which must be limited to 10 of a bank’s capital and surplus for any one affiliate and 20 for all affiliates furthermore within the foregoing limitations as to amount certain covered transactions must meet specified collateral requirements ranging from 100 to 130 covered transactions are defined to include among other things a loan or extension of credit as well as a purchase of securities issued by an affiliate a purchase of assets unless otherwise exempted by the frb from the affiliate the acceptance of securities issued by the affiliate as collateral for a loan derivatives transactions and securities lending transactions where the bank has credit exposure to an affiliate and the issuance of a guarantee acceptance or letter of credit on behalf of an affiliate all covered transactions including certain additional transactions such as transactions with a third party in which an affiliate has a financial interest must be conducted on market terms the frb enforces these restrictions and we are audited for compliance 

section 23b prohibits an institution from engaging in certain transactions with affiliates unless the transactions are on terms substantially the same or at least as favorable to the bank as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with nonaffiliated companies transactions between a bank and any of its subsidiaries that are engaged in certain financial activities may be subject to the affiliated transaction limits the frb also may designate banking subsidiaries as affiliates 

pursuant to frb regulation o we are also subject to quantitative restrictions on extensions of credit to executive officers directors principal stockholders and their related interests in general such extensions of credit may not exceed certain dollar limitations must be made on substantially the same terms including interest rates and collateral as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with third parties and must not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features certain extensions of credit also require the approval of our board 



volcker rule 

the doddfrank act prohibits banks and their affiliates from engaging in proprietary trading and investing in sponsoring and having certain relationships with private funds such as hedge funds or private equity funds that would be an investment company for purposes of the investment company act of 1940 but for the exclusions in sections 3c1 or 3c7 of that act both subject to certain limited exceptions the statutory provision is commonly called the “volcker rule” the regulations implementing the volcker rule jointly issued by the frb occ fdic the sec and the commodity futures trading commission “cftc” require that large bank holding companies design and implement compliance programs to ensure adherence to the volcker rule’s prohibitions maintenance and monitoring of the required compliance program requires the expenditure of resources and management attention in october 2019 the frb occ fdic cftc and sec issued final rules that tailor the application of the volcker rule based on the size and scope of a banking entity’s trading activities and clarify and amend certain definitions requirements and exemptions these regulators have also stated their intention to engage in further rulemaking with respect to the implementing regulations relating to covered funds including potential changes to the definition of “covered fund” and prohibitions on certain covered transactions 

consumer financial protection regulations 

the retail activities of banks are subject to a variety of statutes and regulations designed to protect consumers and promote lending to various sectors of the economy and population these laws include but are not limited to the equal credit opportunity act the fair debt collection practices act the fair credit reporting act the truth in lending act the home mortgage disclosure act the service members civil relief act the expedited funds availability act the right to financial privacy act the truth in savings act the electronic funds transfer act and their respective federal regulations and state law counterparts 

in addition to these federal laws and regulations the guidance and interpretations of the various federal agencies charged with the responsibility of implementing such regulations also influences loan and deposit operations 

the cfpb has broad rulemaking supervisory examination and enforcement authority over various consumer financial protection laws including the laws referenced above fair lending laws and certain other statutes the cfpb also has examination and primary enforcement authority with respect to depository institutions with 10 billion or more in assets including the authority to prevent unfair deceptive or abusive acts or practices in connection with the offering of consumer financial products 

the doddfrank act permits states to adopt stricter consumer protection laws and standards that are more stringent than those adopted at the federal level and in certain circumstances allows state attorneys general to enforce compliance with both the state and federal laws and regulations state regulation of financial products and potential enforcement actions could also adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

protection of customer personal information and cybersecurity 

the privacy provisions of glba generally prohibit financial institutions including us from disclosing nonpublic personal financial information of consumer customers to third parties for certain purposes primarily marketing unless customers have the opportunity to opt out of the disclosure the fair credit reporting act restricts information sharing among affiliates for marketing purposes both the fair credit reporting act and regulation v issued by the frb govern the use and provision of information to consumer reporting agencies 

the federal banking regulators regularly issue guidance regarding cybersecurity intended to enhance cyber risk management standards among financial institutions financial institutions are expected to design multiple layers of security controls to establish lines of defense and to ensure that their risk management processes also address the risk posed by compromised customer credentials including security measures to reliably authenticate customers’ accessing internetbased services of the financial institution further a financial institution’s management is expected to maintain sufficient business continuity planning processes to ensure the rapid recovery resumption and maintenance of the institution’s operations after a cyberattack involving destructive malware a financial institution is also expected to develop appropriate processes to enable recovery of data and business operations and address rebuilding network capabilities and restoring data if the institution or its critical service providers fall victim to this type of cyberattack if we fail to observe the regulatory guidance we could be subject to various regulatory sanctions including financial penalties for a further discussion of risks related to cybersecurity see item 1a “risk factors” 

in october 2016 federal regulators jointly issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking on enhanced cyber risk management standards that are intended to increase the operational resilience of large and interconnected entities under their supervision once established the enhanced cyber risk management standards would help to 



reduce the potential impact of a cyberattack or other cyberrelated failure on the financial system the advance notice of proposed rulemaking addresses five categories of cyber standards 

i cyber risk governance 

ii cyber risk management 

iii internal dependency management 

iv external dependency management and 

v incident response cyber resilience and situational awareness 

we will continue to monitor any developments related to this proposed rulemaking 

state regulators have also been increasingly active in implementing privacy and cybersecurity standards and regulations recently several states have adopted laws and regulations requiring certain financial institutions to implement cybersecurity programs and providing detailed requirements with respect to these programs including data encryption requirements for example the california consumer privacy act which became effective on january 1 2020 gives new rights to california residents to require certain businesses to disclose or delete their personal information in addition many states have also recently implemented or modified their data breach notification and data privacy requirements we expect this trend of statelevel activity to continue and are continually monitoring developments in the states in which we operate 

community reinvestment act requirements 

the cra requires banking regulators to evaluate the parent company and cbna in meeting the credit needs of our local communities including providing credit to individuals residing in low and moderate income neighborhoods the cra requires each appropriate federal bank regulatory agency in connection with its examination of a depository institution to assess such institution’s record in assessing and meeting the credit needs of the community served by that institution and assign ratings the regulatory agency’s assessment of the institution’s record is made available to the public these evaluations are also considered in evaluating mergers acquisitions and applications to open a branch or facility and in the case of a bank holding company that has elected financial holding company status a cra rating of at least “satisfactory” is required to commence certain new financial activities or to acquire a company engaged in such activities cbna received a rating of “outstanding” in our most recent cra evaluation 

in december 2019 the occ and fdic issued a notice of proposed rulemaking intended to clarify which activities qualify for cra credit update where activities count for cra credit create a more transparent and objective method for measuring cra performance and provide for more transparent consistent and timely crarelated data collection recordkeeping and reporting we will continue to evaluate the impact of any changes to the regulations implementing the cra 

compensation 

our compensation practices are subject to oversight by the frb and the occ the federal banking regulators have issued guidance designed to ensure that incentive compensation arrangements at banking organizations take into account risk and are consistent with safe and sound practices the guidance sets forth the following three key principles with respect to incentive compensation arrangements 

 the guidance provides that supervisory findings with respect to incentive compensation will be incorporated as appropriate into the organization’s supervisory ratings 



the us financial regulators including the frb the occ and the sec jointly proposed regulations in 2011 and again in 2016 to implement the incentive compensation requirements of section 956 of the doddfrank act these regulations have not been finalized 

antimoney laundering 

the usa patriot act enacted in 2001 and renewed in 2006 substantially broadened the scope of us antimoney laundering laws and regulations by imposing significant new compliance and due diligence obligations creating new crimes and penalties and expanding the extraterritorial jurisdiction of the united states institutions must maintain antimoney laundering programs that include established internal policies procedures and controls a designated compliance officer an ongoing employee training program and testing of the program by an independent audit function we are prohibited from entering into specified financial transactions and account relationships and must meet enhanced standards for due diligence in dealings with foreign financial institutions and foreign customers we also must take reasonable steps to conduct enhanced scrutiny of account relationships to guard against money laundering and to report any suspicious transactions recent laws provide law enforcement authorities with increased access to financial information maintained by banks 

the usa patriot act also provides for the facilitation of information sharing among governmental entities and financial institutions for the purpose of combating terrorism and money laundering the statute also creates enhanced information collection tools and enforcement mechanics for the us government including requiring standards for verifying customer identification at account opening promulgating rules to promote cooperation among financial institutions regulators and law enforcement entities in identifying parties that may be involved in terrorism or money laundering requiring reports by nonfinancial trades and businesses filed with the treasury’s financial crimes enforcement network “fincen” for transactions exceeding 10000 and mandating the filing of suspicious activities reports if a bank believes a customer may be violating us laws and regulations the statute also requires enhanced due diligence requirements for financial institutions that administer maintain or manage private bank accounts or correspondent accounts for nonus persons bank regulators routinely examine institutions for compliance with these obligations and are required to consider compliance in connection with the regulatory review of applications 

fincen drafts regulations implementing the usa patriot act and other antimoney laundering and bank secrecy act legislation fincen has adopted rules that require financial institutions to obtain beneficial ownership information with respect to legal entities with which such institutions conduct business subject to certain exclusions and exemptions bank regulators are focusing their examinations on antimoney laundering compliance and we continue to monitor and augment where necessary our antimoney laundering compliance programs 

office of foreign assets control regulation 

the us has imposed economic sanctions that affect transactions with designated foreign countries nationals and others these are typically known as the “ofac” rules based on their administration by the us treasury department office of foreign assets control the ofacadministered sanctions targeting countries take many different forms generally they contain one or more of the following elements 

 ofac publishes and routinely updates lists of names of persons and organizations suspected of aiding harboring or engaging in terrorist acts including the specially designated nationals and blocked persons we are responsible for among other things blocking accounts of and transactions with such targets and countries prohibiting unlicensed trade and financial transactions with them and reporting blocked transactions after their occurrence if we find a name on any transaction account or wire transfer that is on an ofac list we must freeze such account file a suspicious activity report and notify the appropriate authorities failure to comply with these sanctions could have serious legal and reputational consequences 



regulation of brokerdealers 

our subsidiary ccmi is a registered brokerdealer with the sec and subject to regulation and examination by the sec as well as finra and other selfregulatory organizations these regulations cover a broad range of issues including capital requirements sales and trading practices use of client funds and securities the conduct of directors officers and employees recordkeeping and recording supervisory procedures to prevent improper trading on material nonpublic information qualification and licensing of sales personnel and limitations on the extension of credit in securities transactions in addition to federal registration state securities commissions require the registration of certain brokerdealers 

heightened risk governance standards 

cbna is subject to occ guidelines imposing heightened risk governance standards on large national banks with average total consolidated assets of 50 billion or more the guidelines set forth minimum standards for the design and implementation of a bank’s risk governance framework and minimum standards for oversight of that framework by a bank’s board of directors the guidelines are intended to protect the safety and soundness of covered banks and improve bank examiners’ ability to assess compliance with the occ’s expectations under the guidelines a bank may use its parent company’s risk governance framework if the framework meets the minimum standards the risk profiles of the parent company and the covered bank are substantially the same and certain other conditions are met cbna has elected to use the parent company’s risk governance framework a bank’s board of directors is required to have two members who are independent of the bank and parent company management a bank’s board of directors is responsible for ensuring that the risk governance framework meets the standards in the guidelines providing active oversight and a credible challenge to management’s recommendations and decisions and ensuring that the parent company decisions do not jeopardize the safety and soundness of the bank 

  intellectual property 

in the highly competitive banking industry in which we operate trademarks service marks trade names and logos are important to the success of our business we own and license a variety of trademarks service marks trade names logos and pending registrations and are spending significant resources to develop our standalone brands 

  employees 

as of december 31 2019  we had approximately 18000 fulltime equivalent employees none of our employees are parties to a collective bargaining agreement we consider our relationship with our employees to be good and have not experienced interruptions of operations due to labor disagreements 




 item 1a risk factors 

we are subject to a number of risks potentially impacting our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows as we are a financial services organization certain elements of risk are inherent in our transactions and operations and are present in the business decisions we make we therefore encounter risk as part of the normal course of our business and we design risk management processes to help manage these risks our success is dependent on our ability to identify understand and manage the risks presented by our business activities so that we can appropriately balance revenue generation and profitability these risks include but are not limited to credit risk market risk liquidity risk operational risk model risk technology regulatory and legal risk and strategic and reputational risk we discuss our principal risk management processes and in appropriate places related historical performance in the “risk governance” section in item 7 

you should carefully consider the following risk factors that may affect our business financial condition and results of operations other factors that could affect our business financial condition and results of operation are discussed in the “forwardlooking statements” section above however there may be additional risks that are not presently material or known and factors besides those discussed below or in this or other reports that we file or furnish with the sec that could also adversely affect us 

risks related to our business 

we may not be able to successfully execute our business strategy 

our business strategy is designed to maximize the full potential of our business and drive sustainable growth and enhanced profitability and our success rests on our ability to maintain a highperforming customercentric organization develop differentiated value propositions to acquire deepen and retain core customer segments 



build excellent capabilities designed to help us stand out from our competitors operate with financial discipline and a mindset of continuous improvement to selffund investments prudently grow and optimize our balance sheet modernize our technology and operational models to improve delivery organizational agility and speed to market and embed risk management within our culture and our operations our future success and the value of our stock will depend in part on our ability to effectively implement our business strategy there are risks and uncertainties many of which are not within our control associated with each element of our strategy if we are not able to successfully execute our business strategy we may never achieve our financial performance goals and any shortfall may be material see the “business strategy” section in item 1 for further information 

supervisory requirements and expectations on us as a financial holding company and a bank holding company and any regulatorimposed limits on our activities could adversely affect our ability to implement our strategic plan expand our business continue to improve our financial performance and make capital distributions to our stockholders 

our operations are subject to extensive regulation supervision and examination by the federal banking agencies the frb the occ and the fdic as well as the cfpb as part of the supervisory and examination process if we are unsuccessful in meeting the supervisory requirements and expectations that apply to us regulatory agencies may from time to time take supervisory actions against us that may not be publicly disclosed such actions may include restrictions on our activities or the activities of our subsidiaries informal nonpublic or formal public supervisory actions or public enforcement actions including the payment of civil money penalties which could increase our costs and limit our ability to implement our strategic plans and expand our business and as a result could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations see the “regulation and supervision” section in item 1 for further information 

changes in interest rates may have an adverse effect on our profitability 

net interest income historically has been and we anticipate that it will remain a significant component of our total revenue this is due to the fact that a high percentage of our assets and liabilities have been and will likely continue to be in the form of interestbearing or interestrelated instruments changes in interest rates can have a material effect on many areas of our business including net interest income deposit costs loan volume and delinquency and the value of our mortgage servicing rights interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond our control including general economic conditions and policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies and in particular the federal open market committee changes in monetary policy including changes in interest rates could influence not only the interest we receive on loans and securities and the amount of interest we pay on deposits and borrowings but such changes could also affect our ability to originate loans and obtain deposits and the fair value of our financial assets and liabilities if the interest rates on our interestbearing liabilities increase at a faster pace than the interest rates on our interest earning assets our net interest income may decline and with it a decline in our earnings may occur our net interest income and our earnings would be similarly affected if the interest rates on our interest earning assets declined at a faster pace than the interest rates on our interestbearing liabilities 

we cannot control or predict with certainty changes in interest rates global national regional and local economic conditions competitive pressures and the policies of regulatory authorities including monetary policies of the frb affect interest income and interest expense although we have policies and procedures designed to manage the risks associated with changes in market interest rates as further discussed under the “risk governance” section in item 7 changes in interest rates still may have an adverse effect on our profitability 

if our ongoing assumptions regarding borrower or depositor behavior or overall economic conditions are significantly different than we anticipate then our risk mitigation may be insufficient to protect against interest rate risk and our net income would be adversely affected 

changes in the method pursuant to which the libor and other benchmark rates are calculated and their potential discontinuance could adversely impact our business operations and financial results 

many of our lending products securities derivatives and other financial transactions utilize a benchmark rate such as the london interbank offered rate “libor” to determine the applicable interest rate or payment amount in july 2017 the chief executive of the uk financial conduct authority “fca” announced that the fca intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of libor after 2021 this announcement indicates that the continuation of libor cannot and will not be guaranteed after 2021 in late 2018 



we formed a libor transition program designed to guide the organization through the potential discontinuation of libor 

the discontinuation of a benchmark rate changes in a benchmark rate or changes in market perceptions of the acceptability of a benchmark rate including libor could among other things adversely affect the value of and return on certain of our financial instruments or products result in changes to our risk exposures or require renegotiation of previous transactions in addition any such discontinuation or changes whether actual or anticipated could result in market volatility adverse tax or accounting effects increased compliance legal and operational costs and risks associated with customer disclosures and contract negotiations the transition to using a new rate could also expose us to risks associated with disputes with customers and other market participants in connection with interpreting and implementing libor fallback provisions 

various regulators industry bodies and other market participants in the us and other countries are engaged in initiatives to develop introduce and encourage the use of alternative rates to replace certain benchmarks despite progress made to date by regulators and industry participants such as us to prepare for the anticipated discontinuation of libor significant uncertainties still remain such uncertainties relate to for example whether replacement benchmark rates may become accepted alternatives to libor for different types of transactions and financial instruments how the terms of any transaction or financial instrument may be adjusted to account for differences between libor and any alternative rate selected how any replacement would be implemented across the industry and the effect any changes in industry views or movement to alternative benchmarks would have on the markets for liborlinked financial instruments 

we could fail to attract retain or motivate highly skilled and qualified personnel including our senior management other key employees or members of our board which could impair our ability to successfully execute our strategic plan and otherwise adversely affect our business 

a cornerstone of our strategic plan involves the hiring of highly skilled and qualified personnel accordingly our ability to implement our strategic plan and our future success depends on our ability to attract retain and motivate highly skilled and qualified personnel including our senior management and other key employees and directors the marketplace for skilled personnel is becoming more competitive which means the cost of hiring incentivizing and retaining skilled personnel may continue to increase the failure to attract or retain including as a result of an untimely death or illness of key personnel or replace a sufficient number of appropriately skilled and key personnel could place us at a significant competitive disadvantage and prevent us from successfully implementing our strategy which could impair our ability to implement our strategic plan successfully achieve our performance targets and otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

limitations on the manner in which regulated financial institutions such as us can compensate their officers and employees including those contained in pending rule proposals implementing requirements of section 956 of the doddfrank act may make it more difficult for such institutions to compete for talent with financial institutions and other companies not subject to these or similar limitations if we are unable to compete effectively our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected perhaps materially 

our ability to meet our obligations and the cost of funds to do so depend on our ability to access identified sources of liquidity at a reasonable cost 

liquidity risk is the risk that we will not be able to meet our obligations including funding commitments as they come due this risk is inherent in our operations and can be heightened by a number of factors including an overreliance on a particular source of funding including for example secured fhlb advances changes in credit ratings or marketwide phenomena such as market dislocation and major disasters like many banking groups our reliance on customer deposits to meet a considerable portion of our funding has grown over recent years and we continue to seek to increase the proportion of our funding represented by customer deposits however these deposits are subject to fluctuation due to certain factors outside our control such as increasing competitive pressures for retail or corporate customer deposits changes in interest rates and returns on other investment classes or a loss of confidence by customers in us or in the banking sector generally which could result in a significant outflow of deposits within a short period of time to the extent there is heightened competition among us banks for retail customer deposits this competition may increase the cost of procuring new deposits andor retaining existing deposits and otherwise negatively affect our ability to grow our deposit base an inability to grow or any material decrease in our deposits could have a material adverse effect on our ability to satisfy our liquidity needs 

maintaining a diverse and appropriate funding strategy for our assets consistent with our wider strategic risk appetite and plan remains challenging and any tightening of credit markets could have a material adverse 



impact on us in particular there is a risk that corporate and financial institution counterparties may seek to reduce their credit exposures to banks and other financial institutions for example reductions in unsecured deposits supplied by these counterparties which may cause funding from these sources to no longer be available under these circumstances we may need to seek funds from alternative sources potentially at higher costs than has previously been the case or may be required to consider disposals of other assets not previously identified for disposal in order to reduce our funding commitments 

a reduction in our credit ratings which are based on a number of factors could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

credit ratings affect the cost and other terms upon which we are able to obtain funding rating agencies regularly evaluate us and their ratings are based on a number of factors including our financial strength other factors considered by rating agencies include conditions affecting the financial services industry generally any downgrade in our ratings would likely increase our borrowing costs could limit our access to capital markets and otherwise adversely affect our business for example a ratings downgrade could adversely affect our ability to sell or market certain of our securities including longterm debt engage in certain longerterm derivatives transactions and retain our customers particularly corporate customers who may require a minimum rating threshold in order to place funds with us in addition under the terms of certain of our derivatives contracts we may be required to maintain a minimum credit rating or have to post additional collateral or terminate such contracts any of these results of a rating downgrade could increase our cost of funding reduce our liquidity and have adverse effects on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our financial performance may be adversely affected by deterioration in borrower credit quality particularly in the new england midatlantic and midwest regions where our operations are concentrated 

we have exposure to many different industries and risks arising from actual or perceived changes in credit quality and uncertainty over the recoverability of amounts due from borrowers is inherent in our businesses our exposure may be exacerbated by the geographic concentration of our operations which are predominately located in the new england midatlantic and midwest regions the credit quality of our borrowers may deteriorate for a number of reasons that are outside our control including as a result of prevailing economic and market conditions and asset valuation the trends and risks affecting borrower credit quality particularly in the new england midatlantic and midwest regions have caused and in the future may cause us to experience impairment charges increased repurchase demands higher costs additional writedowns and losses and an inability to engage in routine funding transactions which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our framework for managing risks may not be effective in mitigating risk and loss 

our risk management framework is made up of various processes and strategies to manage our risk exposure the framework to manage risk including the framework’s underlying assumptions may not be effective under all conditions and circumstances if the risk management framework proves ineffective we could suffer unexpected losses and could be materially adversely affected 

one of the main types of risks inherent in our business is credit risk an important feature of our credit risk management system is to employ an internal credit risk control system through which we identify measure monitor and mitigate existing and emerging credit risk of our customers as this process involves detailed analyses of the customer or credit risk taking into account both quantitative and qualitative factors it is subject to human error in exercising their judgment our employees may not always be able to assign an accurate credit rating to a customer or credit risk which may result in our exposure to higher credit risks than indicated by our risk rating system 

in addition we have undertaken certain actions to enhance our credit policies and guidelines to address potential risks associated with particular industries or types of customers as discussed in more detail under the “risk governance” and “market risk” sections in item 7 however we may not be able to effectively implement these initiatives or consistently follow and refine our credit risk management system if any of the foregoing were to occur it may result in an increase in the level of nonperforming loans and a higher risk exposure for us which could have a material adverse effect on us 



changes in our accounting policies or in accounting standards could materially affect how we report our financial results and condition 

from time to time the fasb and sec change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of our financial statements these changes can be operationally complex to implement and can materially impact how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations for example in june 2016 the fasb issued accounting standards update 201613 measurement of credit losses on financial instruments “cecl” that effective january 1 2020 substantially changed the accounting for credit losses on loans and other financial assets held by banks financial institutions and other organizations the standard replaces existing incurred loss impairment guidance and establishes a single allowance framework for financial assets carried at amortized cost upon adoption of cecl companies must recognize credit losses on these assets equal to management’s estimate of credit losses over the full remaining expected life companies must consider all relevant information when estimating expected credit losses including details about past events current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts in december 2018 the federal reserve occ and fdic released a final rule to revise their regulatory capital rules to address this upcoming change to the treatment of credit expense and allowances the final rule provides an optional threeyear phasein period for the dayone adverse regulatory capital effects upon adopting the standard we adopted the standard on january 1 2020 and elected to phase in the impact of the standard over a threeyear period the standard could introduce heightened volatility in provision for credit losses given uncertainty in the accuracy of macroeconomic forecasts over longer time horizons variances in the rate and composition of loan growth changes in overall loan portfolio size and mix as a result following adoption it is possible that our ongoing reported earnings and lending activity could be negatively impacted for more information regarding cecl see note 1 in item 8 

our financial and accounting estimates and risk management framework rely on analytical forecasting and models 

the processes we use to estimate our inherent loan losses and to measure the fair value of financial instruments as well as the processes used to estimate the effects of changing interest rates and other market measures on our financial condition and results of operations depends upon the use of analytical and forecasting models some of our tools and metrics for managing risk are based upon our use of observed historical market behavior we rely on quantitative models to measure risks and to estimate certain financial values models may be used in such processes as determining the pricing of various products grading loans and extending credit measuring interest rate and other market risks predicting losses assessing capital adequacy and calculating regulatory capital levels as well as estimating the value of financial instruments and balance sheet items poorly designed or implemented models present the risk that our business decisions based on information incorporating such models will be adversely affected due to the inadequacy of that information moreover our models may fail to predict future risk exposures if the information used in the model is incorrect obsolete or not sufficiently comparable to actual events as they occur we seek to incorporate appropriate historical data in our models but the range of market values and behaviors reflected in any period of historical data is not at all times predictive of future developments in any particular period and the period of data we incorporate into our models may turn out to be inappropriate for the future period being modeled in such case our ability to manage risk would be limited and our risk exposure and losses could be significantly greater than our models indicated in addition if existing or potential customers believe our risk management is inadequate they could take their business elsewhere this could harm our reputation as well as our revenues and profits finally information we provide to our regulators based on poorly designed or implemented models could also be inaccurate or misleading some of the decisions that our regulators make including those related to capital distributions to our stockholders could be affected adversely due to their perception that the quality of the models used to generate the relevant information is insufficient 

the preparation of our financial statements requires the use of estimates that may vary from actual results particularly various factors may cause our alll to increase 

the preparation of audited consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make significant estimates that affect the financial statements our most critical accounting estimate is the alll the alll is a reserve established through a provision for loan and lease losses charged to expense and represents our estimate of incurred but unrealized losses within the existing portfolio of loans the alll is necessary to reserve for estimated loan and lease losses and risks inherent in the loan portfolio the level of the alll reflects our ongoing evaluation of industry concentrations specific credit risks loan and lease loss experience current loan portfolio quality present economic political and regulatory conditions and incurred losses inherent in the current loan portfolio 



the determination of the appropriate level of the alll inherently involves a degree of subjectivity and requires that we make significant estimates of current credit risks and future trends all of which may undergo material changes changes in economic conditions affecting borrowers the stagnation of certain economic indicators that we are more susceptible to such as unemployment and real estate values new information regarding existing loans identification of additional problem loans and other factors both within and outside our control may require an increase in the alll in addition bank regulatory agencies periodically review our alll and may require an increase in the alll or the recognition of further loan chargeoffs based on judgments that can differ from those of our own management in addition if chargeoffs in future periods exceed the alll—that is if the alll is inadequate—we will need additional loan and lease loss provisions to increase the alll should such additional provisions become necessary they would result in a decrease in net income and capital and may have a material adverse effect on us for more information regarding our use of estimates in preparation of financial statements see note 1 in item 8 and the “critical accounting estimates” section in item 7 

operational risks are inherent in our businesses 

our operations depend on our ability to process a very large number of transactions efficiently and accurately while complying with applicable laws and regulations operational risk and losses can result from internal and external fraud improper conduct or errors by employees or third parties failure to document transactions properly or to obtain proper authorization failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements and conduct of business rules equipment failures including those caused by natural disasters or by electrical telecommunications or other essential utility outages business continuity and data security system failures including those caused by computer viruses cyberattacks or unforeseen problems encountered while implementing major new computer systems or upgrades to existing systems or the inadequacy or failure of systems and controls including those of our suppliers or counterparties although we have implemented risk controls and loss mitigation actions and substantial resources are devoted to developing efficient procedures identifying and rectifying weaknesses in existing procedures and training staff it is not possible to be certain that such actions have been or will be effective in controlling each of the operational risks faced by us any weakness in these systems or controls or any breaches or alleged breaches of such laws or regulations could result in increased regulatory supervision enforcement actions and other disciplinary action and have an adverse impact on our business applicable authorizations and licenses reputation and results of operations 

the financial services industry including the banking sector is undergoing rapid technological changes as a result of competition and changes in the legal and regulatory framework and we may not be able to compete effectively as a result of these changes 

the financial services industry including the banking sector is continually undergoing rapid technological change with frequent introductions of new technologydriven products and services in addition new unexpected technological changes could have a disruptive effect on the way banks offer products and services we believe our success depends to a great extent on our ability to address customer needs by using technology to offer products and services that provide convenience to customers and to create additional efficiencies in our operations however we may not be able to among other things keep up with the rapid pace of technological changes effectively implement new technologydriven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to our customers as a result our ability to compete effectively to attract or retain new business may be impaired and our business financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected 

in addition changes in the legal and regulatory framework under which we operate require us to update our information systems to ensure compliance our need to review and evaluate the impact of ongoing rule proposals final rules and implementation guidance from regulators further complicates the development and implementation of new information systems for our business also recent regulatory guidance has focused on the need for financial institutions to perform increased due diligence and ongoing monitoring of thirdparty vendor relationships thus increasing the scope of management involvement and decreasing the efficiency otherwise resulting from our relationships with thirdparty technology providers given the significant number of ongoing regulatory reform initiatives it is possible that we incur higher than expected information technology costs in order to comply with current and impending regulations see “—supervisory requirements and expectations on us as a financial holding company and a bank holding company and any regulatorimposed limits on our activities could adversely affect our ability to implement our strategic plan expand our business continue to improve our financial performance and make capital distributions to our stockholders” 



we are subject to a variety of cybersecurity risks that if realized could adversely affect how we conduct our business 

information security risks for large financial institutions such as us have increased significantly in recent years in part because of the proliferation of new technologies such as internet and mobile banking to conduct financial transactions and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime hackers terrorists nationstates activists and other external parties third parties with whom we or our customers do business also present operational and information security risks to us including security breaches or failures of their own systems the possibility of employee error failure to follow security procedures or malfeasance also presents these risks our operations rely on the secure processing transmission and storage of confidential information in our computer systems and networks in addition to access our products and services our customers may use personal computers smartphones tablets and other mobile devices that are beyond our control environment although we believe that we have appropriate information security procedures and controls our technologies systems networks and our customers’ devices may be the target of cyberattacks or information security breaches that could result in the unauthorized release gathering monitoring misuse loss or destruction of the confidential andor proprietary information of cfg our customers our vendors our counterparties or our employees we are under continuous threat of loss due to cyberattacks especially as we continue to expand customer capabilities to utilize the internet and other remote channels to transact business two of the most significant cyberattack risks that we face are efraud and loss of sensitive customer data loss from efraud occurs when cybercriminals extract funds directly from customers’ or our accounts using fraudulent schemes that may include internetbased funds transfers we have been subject to a number of efraud incidents historically we have also been subject to attempts to steal sensitive customer data such as account numbers and social security numbers through unauthorized access to our computer systems including computer hacking such attacks are less frequent but could present significant reputational legal and regulatory costs to us if successful we have implemented certain technology protections such as customer profiling and setup authentication to be in compliance with the ffiec authentication in internet banking environment “aibe” guidelines 

as cyber threats continue to evolve we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our layers of defense or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities system enhancements and updates may also create risks associated with implementing new systems and integrating them with existing ones due to the complexity and interconnectedness of information technology systems the process of enhancing our layers of defense can itself create a risk of systems disruptions and security issues in addition addressing certain information security vulnerabilities such as hardwarebased vulnerabilities may affect the performance of our information technology systems the ability of our hardware and software providers to deliver patches and updates to mitigate vulnerabilities in a timely manner can introduce additional risks particularly when a vulnerability is being actively exploited by threat actors 

despite our efforts to prevent a cyberattack a successful cyberattack could persist for an extended period of time before being detected and following detection it could take considerable time for us to obtain full and reliable information about the cybersecurity incident and the extent amount and type of information compromised during the course of an investigation we may not necessarily know the full effects of the incident or how to remediate it and actions and decisions that are taken or made in an effort to mitigate risk may further increase the costs and other negative consequences of the incident 

the techniques used by cyber criminals change frequently may not be recognized until launched and can be initiated from a variety of sources including terrorist organizations and hostile foreign governments these actors may attempt to fraudulently induce employees customers or other users of our systems to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to data or our systems in the event that a cyberattack is successful our business financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected for a discussion of the guidance that federal banking regulators have released regarding cybersecurity and cyber risk management standards see the “regulation and supervision” section of item 1 

we rely heavily on communications and information systems to conduct our business 

we rely heavily on communications and information systems to conduct our business any failure interruption or breach in security of these systems including due to hacking or other similar attempts to breach information technology security protocols could result in failures or disruptions in our customer relationship management general ledger deposit loan and other systems although we have established policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the effect of the possible failure interruption or security breach of our information systems there can be no assurance that these policies and procedures will be successful and that any such failure interruption or 



security breach will not occur or if they do occur that they will be adequately addressed the occurrence of any failure interruption or security breach of our information systems could require us to devote substantial resources including management time and attention to recovery and response efforts damage our reputation result in a loss of customer business subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny or expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability although we maintain insurance coverage for information security events we may incur losses as a result of such events that are not insured against or not fully covered by our insurance 

we rely on third parties for the performance of a significant portion of our information technology 

we rely on third parties for the performance of a significant portion of our information technology functions and the provision of information technology and business process services for example i unaffiliated third parties operate data communications networks on which certain components and services relating to our online banking system rely ii third parties host or maintain many of our applications including our commercial loan system which is hosted and maintained by automated financial systems inc iii fidelity national information services inc maintains our core deposits system and iv ibm corporation provides us with a wide range of information technology support services including end user data center mainframe storage and database services the success of our business depends in part on the continuing ability of these and other third parties to perform these functions and services in a timely and satisfactory manner which performance could be disrupted or otherwise adversely affected due to failures or other information security events originating at the third parties or at the third parties’ suppliers or vendors socalled “fourth party risk” we may not be able to effectively monitor or mitigate fourthparty risk in particular as it relates to the use of common suppliers or vendors by the third parties that perform functions and services for us if we experience a disruption in the provision of any functions or services performed by third parties we may have difficulty in finding alternate providers on terms favorable to us and in reasonable time frames if these services are not performed in a satisfactory manner we would not be able to serve our customers well in either situation our business could incur significant costs and be adversely affected 

we are exposed to reputational risk and the risk of damage to our brands and the brands of our affiliates 

our success and results depend in part on our reputation and the strength of our brands we are vulnerable to adverse market perception as we operate in an industry where integrity customer trust and confidence are paramount we are exposed to the risk that litigation employee misconduct operational failures the outcome of regulatory or other investigations or actions press speculation and negative publicity among other factors could damage our brands or reputation our brands and reputation could also be harmed if we sell products or services that do not perform as expected or customers’ expectations for the product are not satisfied 

we may be adversely affected by unpredictable catastrophic events or terrorist attacks and our business continuity and disaster recovery plans may not adequately protect us from serious disaster 

the occurrence of catastrophic events such as hurricanes tropical storms tornadoes and other largescale catastrophes and terrorist attacks could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations if a catastrophe rendered both our production data center in rhode island and our recovery data center in north carolina unusable although we enhanced our disaster recovery capabilities in 2016 through the completion of the new outofregion backup data center in north carolina there can be no assurance that our current disaster recovery plans and capabilities will adequately protect us from serious disaster 

risks related to our industry 

any deterioration in national economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our business is affected by national economic conditions as well as perceptions of those conditions and future economic prospects changes in such economic conditions are not predictable and cannot be controlled adverse economic conditions could require us to charge off a higher percentage of loans and increase the provision for credit losses which would reduce our net income and otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations for example our business was significantly affected by the global economic and financial crisis that began in 2008 the falling home prices increased rate of foreclosure and high levels of unemployment in the united states triggered significant writedowns by us and other financial institutions these writedowns adversely impacted our financial results in material respects although the us economy has 



made a significant recovery an interruption or reversal of this recovery would adversely affect the financial services industry and banking sector 

we operate in an industry that is highly competitive which could result in losing business or margin declines and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we operate in a highly competitive industry the industry could become even more competitive as a result of reform of the financial services industry resulting from the doddfrank act and other legislative regulatory and technological changes as well as continued consolidation we face aggressive competition from other domestic and foreign lending institutions and from numerous other providers of financial services including nonbanking financial institutions that are not subject to the same regulatory restrictions as banks and bank holding companies securities firms and insurance companies and competitors that may have greater financial resources 

with respect to nonbanking financial institutions technology and other changes have lowered barriers to entry and made it possible for nonbanks to offer products and services traditionally provided by banks for example consumers can maintain funds that would have historically been held as bank deposits in brokerage accounts or mutual funds consumers can also complete transactions such as paying bills andor transferring funds directly without the assistance of banks the process of eliminating banks as intermediaries known as “disintermediation” could result in the loss of fee income as well as the loss of customer deposits and the related income generated from those deposits some of our nonbank competitors are not subject to the same extensive regulations we are and therefore may have greater flexibility in competing for business as a result of these and other sources of competition we could lose business to competitors or be forced to price products and services on less advantageous terms to retain or attract clients either of which would adversely affect our profitability 

the conditions of other financial institutions or of the financial services industry could adversely affect our operations and financial conditions 

financial services institutions are typically interconnected as a result of trading investment liquidity management clearing counterparty and other relationships within the financial services industry the default by any one institution could lead to defaults by other institutions concerns about or a default by one institution could lead to significant liquidity problems and losses or defaults by other institutions as the commercial and financial soundness of many financial institutions are closely related as a result of these credit trading clearing and other relationships even the perceived lack of creditworthiness of or questions about a counterparty may lead to marketwide liquidity problems and losses or defaults by various institutions this systemic risk may adversely affect financial intermediaries such as clearing agencies banks and exchanges with which we interact on a daily basis or key funding providers such as the fhlbs any of which could have a material adverse effect on our access to liquidity or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

risks related to regulations governing our industry 

as a financial holding company and a bank holding company we are subject to comprehensive regulation that could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

as a financial holding company and a bank holding company we are subject to comprehensive regulation supervision and examination by the frb in addition cbna is subject to comprehensive regulation supervision and examination by the occ our regulators supervise us through regular examinations and other means that allow the regulators to gauge management’s ability to identify assess and control risk in all areas of operations in a safe and sound manner and to ensure compliance with laws and regulations in the course of their supervision and examinations our regulators may require improvements in various areas if we are unable to implement and maintain any required actions in a timely and effective manner we could become subject to informal nonpublic or formal public supervisory actions and public enforcement orders that could lead to significant restrictions on our existing business or on our ability to engage in any new business such forms of supervisory action could include without limitation written agreements cease and desist orders and consent orders and may among other things result in restrictions on our ability to pay dividends requirements to increase capital restrictions on our activities the imposition of civil monetary penalties and enforcement of such actions through injunctions or restraining orders we could also be required to dispose of certain assets and liabilities within a prescribed period the terms of any such supervisory or enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 



we are a bank holding company that has elected to become a financial holding company pursuant to the bank holding company act financial holding companies are allowed to engage in certain financial activities in which a bank holding company is not otherwise permitted to engage however to maintain financial holding company status a bank holding company and all of its depository institution subsidiaries must be “well capitalized” and “well managed” if a bank holding company ceases to meet these capital and management requirements there are many penalties it would be faced with including the frb may impose limitations or conditions on the conduct of its activities and it may not undertake any of the broader financial activities permissible for financial holding companies or acquire a company engaged in such financial activities without prior approval of the frb if a company does not return to compliance within 180 days which period may be extended the frb may require divestiture of that company’s depository institutions to the extent we do not meet the requirements to be a financial holding company in the future there could be a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we may be unable to disclose some restrictions or limitations on our operations imposed by our regulators 

from time to time bank regulatory agencies take supervisory actions that restrict or limit a financial institution’s activities and lead it to raise capital or subject it to other requirements directives issued to enforce such actions may be confidential and thus in some instances we are not permitted to publicly disclose these actions in addition as part of our regular examination process our regulators may advise us to operate under various restrictions as a prudential matter any such actions or restrictions if and in whatever manner imposed could adversely affect our costs and revenues moreover efforts to comply with any such nonpublic supervisory actions or restrictions may require material investments in additional resources and systems as well as a significant commitment of managerial time and attention as a result such supervisory actions or restrictions if and in whatever manner imposed could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations and in certain instances we may not be able to publicly disclose these matters 

the regulatory environment in which we operate continues to be subject to significant and evolving regulatory requirements that could have a material adverse effect on our business and earnings 

we are heavily regulated by multiple banking consumer protection securities and other regulatory authorities at the federal and state levels this regulatory oversight is primarily established to protect depositors the fdic’s deposit insurance fund consumers of financial products and the financial system as a whole not our security holders changes to statutes regulations rules or policies including the interpretation implementation or enforcement of statutes regulations rules or policies could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways including by for example subjecting us to additional costs limiting the types of financial services and other products we may offer limiting our ability to pursue acquisitions and increasing the ability of third parties including nonbanks to offer competing financial services and products in recent years we together with the rest of the financial services industry have faced particularly intense scrutiny with many new regulatory initiatives and vigorous oversight and enforcement on the part of numerous regulatory and governmental authorities legislatures and regulators have pursued a broad array of initiatives intended to promote the safety and soundness of financial institutions financial market stability the transparency and liquidity of financial markets and consumer and investor protection certain regulators and law enforcement authorities have also recently required admissions of wrongdoing and in some cases criminal pleas as part of the resolutions of matters brought by them against financial institutions any such resolution of a matter involving us could lead to increased exposure to civil litigation could adversely affect our reputation could result in penalties or limitations on our ability to do business or engage in certain activities and could have other negative effects in addition a single event or issue may give rise to numerous and overlapping investigations and proceedings including by multiple federal and state regulators and other governmental authorities 

we are also subject to laws and regulations relating to the privacy of the information of our customers employees counterparties and others and any failure to comply with these laws and regulations could expose us to liability andor reputational damage as new privacyrelated laws and regulations are implemented the time and resources needed for us to comply with those laws and regulations as well as our potential liability for noncompliance and our reporting obligations in the case of data breaches may significantly increase 

while there have been significant revisions to the laws and regulations applicable to us that have been finalized in recent months there are other rules to implement changes that have yet to be proposed or enacted by our regulators the final timing scope and impact of these changes to the regulatory framework applicable to financial institutions remains uncertain for more information on the regulations to which we are subject and 



recent initiatives to reform financial institution regulation see the “regulation and supervision” section in item 1 

we are subject to capital adequacy and liquidity standards and if we fail to meet these standards our financial condition and operations would be adversely affected 

we are subject to several capital adequacy and liquidity standards to the extent that we are unable to meet these standards our ability to make distributions of capital will be limited and we may be subject to additional supervisory actions and limitations on our activities see “regulation and supervision” in item 1 and the “capital and regulatory requirements” and “liquidity” sections in item 7 for further discussion of the regulations to which we are subject 

the parent company could be required to act as a “source of strength” to cbna which would have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

frb policy historically required bank holding companies to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to their subsidiary banks the doddfrank act codified this policy as a statutory requirement this support may be required by the frb at times when we might otherwise determine not to provide it or when doing so is not otherwise in the interests of cfg or our stockholders or creditors and may include one or more of the following 

 the parent company depends on cbna for most of its revenue and restrictions on dividends and other distributions by cbna could affect its liquidity and ability to fulfill our obligations 

as a bank holding company the parent company is a separate and distinct legal entity from cbna our banking subsidiary the parent company typically receives substantially all of our revenue from dividends from cbna these dividends are the principal source of funds to pay dividends on our equity and interest and principal on our debt various federal andor state laws and regulations as well as regulatory expectations limit the amount of dividends that cbna may pay to the parent company also our right to participate in a distribution of assets upon a subsidiary’s liquidation or reorganization is subject to the prior claims of the subsidiary’s creditors in the event cbna is unable to pay dividends to the parent company it may not be able to service debt pay obligations or pay dividends on its common stock the inability to receive dividends from cbna could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations see the “supervision and regulation” section in item 1 and the “capital and regulatory matters” section in item 7 

from timetotime we may become or are subject to regulatory actions that may have a material impact on our business 

we may become or are involved from time to time in reviews investigations and proceedings both formal and informal by governmental and selfregulatory agencies regarding our business these regulatory actions involve among other matters accounting compliance and operational matters certain of which may result in adverse judgments settlements fines penalties injunctions or other relief that may require changes to our business or otherwise materially impact our business 

in regulatory actions such as those referred to above it is inherently difficult to determine whether any loss is probable or whether it is possible to reasonably estimate the amount of any loss we cannot predict with certainty if how or when such proceedings will be resolved or what the eventual fine penalty or other relief conditions or restrictions if any may be particularly for actions that are in their early stages of investigation the parent company may be required to make significant restitution payments to cbna customers arising from certain compliance issues and also may be required to pay civil money penalties in connection with certain of these issues this uncertainty makes it difficult to estimate probable losses which in turn can lead to substantial disparities between the reserves we may establish for such proceedings and the eventual settlements fines or penalties 



adverse regulatory actions could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are and may be subject to litigation that may have a material impact on our business 

our operations are diverse and complex and we operate in legal and regulatory environments that expose us to potentially significant litigation risk in the normal course of business we have been named from time to time as a defendant in various legal actions including arbitrations class actions and other litigation arising in connection with our activities as a financial services institution including with respect to alleged unfair or deceptive business practices and misselling of certain products certain of the actual or threatened legal actions include claims for substantial compensatory andor punitive damages or claims for indeterminate amounts of damages in some cases the entities that would otherwise be the primary defendants in such cases are bankrupt or in financial distress moreover a number of recent judicial decisions have upheld the right of borrowers to sue lending institutions on the basis of various evolving legal theories collectively termed “lender liability” generally lender liability is founded on the premise that a lender has either violated a duty whether implied or contractual of good faith and fair dealing owed to the borrower or has assumed a degree of control over the borrower resulting in the creation of a fiduciary duty owed to the borrower or its other creditors or stockholders this could increase the amount of private litigation to which we are subject for more information regarding ongoing significant legal proceedings in which we may be involved see note 18 in item 8 

compliance with antimoney laundering and antiterrorism financing rules involve significant cost and effort 

we are subject to rules and regulations regarding money laundering and the financing of terrorism monitoring compliance with antimoney laundering and antiterrorism financing rules can put a significant financial burden on banks and other financial institutions and poses significant technical challenges although we believe our current policies and procedures are sufficient to comply with applicable rules and regulations we cannot guarantee that our antimoney laundering and antiterrorism financing policies and procedures completely prevent situations of money laundering or terrorism financing any such failure events may have severe consequences including sanctions fines and reputational consequences which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

risks related to our common stock 

our stock price may be volatile and you could lose all or part of your investment as a result 

you should consider an investment in our common stock to be risky and you should invest in our common stock only if you can withstand a significant loss and wide fluctuation in the market value of your investment the market price of our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to among other things the factors described in this “risk factors” section and other factors some of which are beyond our control these factors include 

 furthermore the stock markets have experienced price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market price of equity securities of many companies these fluctuations have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies these broad market fluctuations as well as general economic systemic political and market conditions such as recessions loss of investor confidence interest rate changes or international currency fluctuations may negatively affect the market price of our common stock 



if any of the foregoing occurs it could cause our stock price to fall and may expose us to securities class action litigation that even if unsuccessful could be costly to defend and a distraction to management 

we may not repurchase shares or pay cash dividends on our common stock 

holders of our common stock are only entitled to receive such dividends as our board of directors may declare out of funds legally available for such payments although we have historically declared cash dividends on our common stock we are not required to do so and may reduce or eliminate our common stock dividend in the future this could adversely affect the market price of our common stock also as a bank holding company our ability to repurchase shares and declare and pay dividends is dependent on certain federal regulatory considerations including the rules of the frb regarding capital adequacy and dividends additionally we are required to submit periodic capital plans to the frb for review or otherwise obtain frb authorization before we can take certain capital actions including repurchasing shares declaring and paying dividends or repurchasing or redeeming capital securities if our capital plan or any amendment to our capital plan is objected to for any reason our ability to repurchase shares and declare and pay dividends on our capital stock may be limited further if we are unable to satisfy the capital requirements applicable to us for any reason we may be limited in our ability to repurchase shares and declare and pay dividends on our capital stock see the “regulation and supervision” section in item 1 for further discussion of the regulations to which we are subject 

“antitakeover” provisions and the regulations to which we are subject may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us even if the change in control would be beneficial to stockholders 

we are a bank holding company incorporated in the state of delaware antitakeover provisions in delaware law and our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws as well as regulatory approvals that would be required under federal law could make it more difficult for a third party to take control of us and may prevent stockholders from receiving a premium for their shares of our common stock these provisions could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and could reduce the amount that stockholders might get if we are sold 

we believe these provisions protect our stockholders from coercive or otherwise unfair takeover tactics by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with our board and by providing our board with more time to assess any acquisition proposal however these provisions apply even if the offer may be determined to be beneficial by some stockholders and could delay or prevent an acquisition that our board determines is not in our best interest and that of our stockholders 

furthermore banking laws impose notice approval and ongoing regulatory requirements on any stockholder or other party that seeks to acquire direct or indirect “control” of an fdicinsured depository institution these laws include the bank holding company act and the change in bank control act

key performance metrics used by management and nongaap financial measures 

as a banking institution we manage and evaluate various aspects of our results of operations and our financial condition including the levels and trends of the line items included in our balance sheet and statement of operations used in calculating various key performance metrics commonly used in our industry the primary line items we use in calculating our key performance metrics to manage and evaluate our statement of operations include net interest income noninterest income total revenue provision for credit losses noninterest expense net income and net income available to common stockholders the primary line items we use in calculating our key performance metrics to manage and evaluate our balance sheet data include loans and leases securities allowance for credit losses deposits borrowed funds and derivatives we analyze these key performance metrics and financial trends against our own historical performance our budgeted performance and the financial condition and performance of comparable banking institutions in our region and nationally 

we consider the following key performance metrics when evaluating our performance and making daytoday operating decisions as well as evaluating capital utilization and adequacy including 

 this document contains nongaap financial measures denoted as “underlying” results underlying results for any given reporting period exclude certain items that may occur in that period which management does not consider indicative of our ongoing financial performance we believe these nongaap financial measures provide useful information to investors because they are used by management to evaluate our operating performance and make daytoday operating decisions in addition we believe our underlying results in any given reporting period reflect our ongoing financial performance and increase comparability of periodtoperiod results and accordingly are useful to consider in addition to our gaap financial results 

other companies may use similarly titled nongaap financial measures that are calculated differently from the way we calculate such measures accordingly our nongaap financial measures may not be comparable to similar measures used by such companies we caution investors not to place undue reliance on such nongaap financial measures but to consider them with the most directly comparable gaap measures nongaap financial measures 



have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for our results reported under gaap 

nongaap measures are denoted throughout our mda by the use of the term underlying and where there is a reference to underlying results in a paragraph all measures that follow this reference are on the same basis when applicable for more information on the computation of key performance metrics and nongaap financial measures see “—key performance metrics nongaap financial measures and reconciliations”

2019 compared with 2018  key highlights 

net income of 18 billion increase d 4 from 2018  with earnings per diluted common share of 381  up 8 from 352 per diluted common share for 2018  rotce of 126 compares with 129 in 2018

results of operations — 2019 compared with 2018 

net interest income 

net interest income is our largest source of revenue and is the difference between the interest earned on interestearning assets generally loans leases and investment securities and the interest expense incurred in connection with interestbearing liabilities generally deposits and borrowed funds the level of net interest income is primarily a function of the difference between the effective yield on our average interestearning assets and the effective cost of our interestbearing liabilities these factors are influenced by the pricing and mix of interestearning assets and interestbearing liabilities which in turn are impacted by external factors such as local economic conditions competition for loans and deposits the monetary policy of the frb and market interest rates 



the following table presents the major components of net interest income and net interest margin 



1 interest income and rates on loans include loan fees additionally 778 million and 836 million of average nonaccrual loans were included in the average loan balances used to determine the average yield on loans for december 2019 and 2018  respectively 

2 balances are net of certain shortterm receivables associated with reverse repurchase agreements as applicable interest expense includes the full cost of the repurchase agreements and certain hedging costs 

3 beginning in the first quarter of 2019 borrowed funds balances and the associated interest expense are classified based on original maturity prior periods have been adjusted to conform with the current period presentation 

4 net interest income and net interest margin is presented on a fully taxableequivalent “fte” basis using the federal statutory tax rate of 21 the fte impact is predominantly attributable to commercial loans for the periods presented 



net interest income of 46 billion increased 82 million  reflecting 4 average interestearning asset growth partially offset by a 7 basis point decrease in net interest margin given the challenging yield curve environment 

net interest margin of 314 decrease d 7 basis points compared to 321 in 2018  driven by higher funding costs tied to modestly higher shortterm rates and higher securities premium amortization tied to significantly lower longterm rates these results were partially offset by the benefit of higher interestearning asset yields given continued mix shift toward more attractive riskadjusted return portfolios and modestly higher shortterm rates net interest margin on an fte basis of 316 decrease d 6 basis points compared to 322 in 2018  average interestearning asset yields of 419 increase d 14 basis points from 405 in 2018  while average interestbearing liability costs of 146 increase d 27 basis points from 119 in 2018  

average interestearning assets of 1468 billion increase d  55 billion  or 4  from 2018  driven by a 29 billion increase in average commercial loans and leases a 16 billion increase in average retail loans a 932 million increase in average total loans held for sale and a 156 million increase in total investment securities and interestbearing cash and due from banks and deposits in banks total commercial loan and lease growth was driven by commercial and commercial real estate retail loan growth was driven by residential mortgage education credit cards and other retail 

average deposits of 1233 billion increase d 74 billion from 2018  reflecting growth in savings term deposits checking with interest and money market accounts partially offset by a decline in demand deposits total interestbearing deposit costs of 12 billion increase d 370 million  or 47  from 785 million in 2018  primarily due to higher shortterm rates and average deposit growth 

average total borrowed funds of 137 billion decrease d 22 billion from 2018  reflecting a decrease in other shortterm borrowed funds a decrease in longterm borrowed funds and a decrease in federal funds purchased and repurchase agreements total borrowed funds costs of 420 million decreased 21 million from 2018  the total borrowed funds cost of 306 increase d 30 basis points from 276 in 2018 due to an increase in shortterm rates and a mix shift to longterm senior debt 

  



the following table presents the change in interest income and interest expense due to changes in both average volume and average rate volume and rate changes have been allocated on a consistent basis using the respective percentage changes in average balances and average rates 





noninterest income 

the following table presents the significant components of our noninterest income 



1 includes net impairment losses recognized in earnings on available for sale debt securities bankowned life insurance income and other income 

noninterest income increase d 281 million  from 2018  reflecting record mortgage banking fees capital markets fees and trust investment services fees which included the impact of acquisitions and along with higher foreign exchange and interest rate products revenue reflected the benefit of investments to broaden and enhance our capabilities results also reflected increase d other income due to higher leasing income including 7 million associated with a lease restructuring transaction and asset dispositions tied to balance sheet optimization and efficiency initiatives 



noninterest expense 

the following table presents the significant components of our noninterest expense 



1 in 2019 we combined our presentation of equipment and expense and amortization of software into equipment and software expense prior periods have been adjusted to conform with the current period presentation 

noninterest expense of 38 billion in 2019 increase d 228 million  or 6  compared to 2018  reflecting higher salaries and employee benefits outside services and equipment and software expense and included the impact of acquisitions as well as continued investments to diversify our platform and drive future revenue growth these results were partially offset by lower other operating expense largely tied to a reduction in fdic insurance premiums underlying noninterest expense increased 214 million  or 6  due to the reasons listed above 



provision for credit losses 

the provision for loan and lease losses is the result of a detailed analysis performed to estimate an appropriate and adequate acl the total provision for credit losses includes the provision for loan and lease losses as well as the provision for unfunded commitments refer to “—analysis of financial condition — allowance for credit losses and nonperforming assets” for more information 

provision for credit losses of 393 million increase d 67 million  or 21  from 326 million in 2018  which reflected a small number of uncorrelated losses in commercial the impact of continued seasoning in retail growth portfolios and loan growth full year 2019 results reflected a 37 million acl release  compared to 9 million acl build in 2018  net chargeoffs in 2019 of 430 million increase d 113 million compared to 2018  

  

income tax expense 

income tax expense of 460 million decrease d 2 million from 462 million in 2018  the 2019 effective tax rate of 204 decreased from 212 in 2018  largely reflecting legacy tax matters a benefit from an operational restructure a reduction in nondeductible fdic insurance premiums and an increase in benefits from tax advantaged investments partially offset by a benefit related to 2017 tax legislation in 2018 on an underlying basis the effective income tax rate decreased to 220 from 225 in 2018  primarily attributable to the reduction in nondeductible fdic insurance premiums and an increase in benefits from tax advantaged investments 



business operating segments 

we have two business operating segments consumer banking and commercial banking segment results are derived by specifically attributing managed assets liabilities capital and related revenues provision for credit losses income taxes and expenses nonsegment operations are classified as other which includes corporate functions the treasury function the securities portfolio wholesale funding activities intangible assets not directly allocated to a business operating segment community development noncore assets and other unallocated assets liabilities capital revenues expenses and residual provision for credit losses and income tax expense for a description of noncore assets see “—analysis of financial condition — allowance for credit losses and nonperforming assets — noncore assets” in addition other includes goodwill not directly assigned to a business operating segment and any associated goodwill impairment charges for impairment testing purposes we assign all goodwill to our consumer and commercial banking reporting units 

our capital levels are evaluated and managed centrally however capital is allocated on a riskadjusted basis to the business operating segments to support evaluation of business performance because funding and asset liability management is a central function funds transferpricing “ftp” methodologies are utilized to allocate a cost of funds used or credit for the funds provided to all business operating segment assets liabilities and capital respectively using a matchedfunding concept the residual effect on net interest income of assetliability management including the residual net interest income related to the ftp process is included in other we periodically evaluate and refine our methodologies used to measure financial performance of our business operating segments 

provision for credit losses is allocated to each business operating segment based on respective actual net chargeoffs the residual difference between the consolidated provision for credit losses and the business operating segments’ net chargeoffs is reflected in other 

noninterest income and expense are directly attributed to each business operating segment including fees service charges salaries and benefits and other direct revenues and costs and are respectively accounted for in a manner similar to our consolidated financial statements occupancy costs are allocated based on utilization of facilities by each business operating segment noninterest expenses incurred by centrally managed operations or business operating segments that directly support another business operating segment’s operations are charged to the applicable business operating segment based on its utilization of those services 

income tax expense is assessed to each business operating segment at a standard tax rate with the residual tax expense or benefit to arrive at the consolidated effective tax rate included in other 

developing and applying methodologies used to allocate items among the business operating segments is a dynamic process accordingly financial results may be revised periodically as management systems are enhanced methods of evaluating performance or product lines are updated or our organizational structure changes 



the following table presents certain financial data of our business operating segments total business operating segment financial results differ from total consolidated net income these differences are reflected in other nonsegment operations see note 25 in item 8 for further information 



1 includes lhfs 

consumer banking 

net interest income increased 118 million  or 4  from 2018  driven by the benefit of a 27 billion increase in average loans led by residential education and unsecured personal loans noninterest income increased 183 million  or 19  from 2018  driven by higher mortgage banking trust and investment services fees card fees and included the impact of acquisitions noninterest expense increased 128 million  or 5  from 2018  reflecting higher salaries and benefits and outside services and included the impact of acquisitions provision for credit losses of 325 million increased 36 million  or 12  reflecting higher net chargeoffs given expected seasoning in growth portfolios 

commercial banking 

net interest income of 15 billion decreased 31 million  or 2  from 2018  reflecting the impact of higher deposit costs partially offset by loan growth noninterest income of 607 million increased 62 million  or 11  from 545 million in 2018  driven by an increase in capital market and foreign exchange and interest rate product fees noninterest expense of 858 million increased 45 million  from 813 million in 2018  driven by higher salaries and employee benefits expense  provision for credit losses of 97 million increased 71 million from 2018  driven by higher net chargeoffs from a small number of uncorrelated losses

analysis of financial condition 

securities 

the following table presents our afs and htm securities 



our securities portfolio is managed to maintain prudent levels of liquidity credit quality and market risk while achieving appropriate returns that align with our overall portfolio management strategy the portfolio includes high quality highly liquid investments reflecting our ongoing commitment to appropriate contingent liquidity levels and pledging capacity us governmentguaranteed notes and gseissued mortgagebacked securities represent 97 of the fair value of our debt securities portfolio holdings holdings backed by mortgages dominate our portfolio and facilitate our ability to pledge those securities to the fhlb for collateral purposes 

the fair value of the afs debt securities portfolio of 206 billion at december 31 2019 increased 718 million from 199 billion at december 31 2018 largely reflecting the impact of the transfer of a net 740 million in securities from htm to afs upon the adoption of asu 2017–12 targeted improvements to accounting for hedging activities  and lower longterm rates the fair value of the htm debt securities portfolio decreased 799 million largely reflecting the net impact of the transfer discussed above for further information see note 1 in item 8 

as of december 31 2019  the portfolio’s average effective duration was 37 years compared with 44 years as of december 31 2018  as lower longterm rates drove an increase in both actual and projected securities prepayment speeds we manage our securities portfolio duration and convexity risk through asset selection and securities structure and maintain duration levels within our risk appetite in the context of the broader interest rate risk in the banking book framework and limits 



the following table presents an analysis of the amortized cost remaining contractual maturities and weightedaverage yields by contractual maturity for our debt securities portfolio expected maturities may differ from contractual maturities because issuers may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without incurring penalties 



1 as of december 31 2019  no investment exceeded 10 of stockholders’ equity 

2 yields on taxexempt securities are not computed on a taxequivalent basis 

3 yields exclude the impact of hedging activity 

loans and leases 

the following table presents the composition of loans and leases 



total loans and leases increased 24 billion  or 2  from 1167 billion as of december 31 2018  driven by growth in both retail and commercial retail loan growth was driven by education other retail credit cards and residential mortgages partially offset by run off in the home equity portfolio commercial loans and leases growth was driven by geographic product and clientfocused expansion strategies as well as strength in commercial real estate partially offset by planned reductions in leases 



maturities and sensitivities of loans and leases to changes in interest rates 

the following table presents a summary of loans and leases by remaining maturity or repricing date 



1 on a maturity basis only the commercial and commercial real estate loan portfolios maturing in one year or less were 74 billion and 26 billion respectively maturing after one year through five years were 278 billion and 98 billion respectively and maturing after five years were 63 billion and 11 billion respectively as of december 31 2019 

  

loan and lease concentrations 

at december 31 2019  we did not identify any concentration of loans and leases exceeding 10 of total loans and leases that were not otherwise disclosed as a category of loans and leases for further information on how we manage concentration exposures see note 5 in item 8 



allowance for credit losses and nonperforming assets 

the acl which consists of an alll and a reserve for unfunded lending commitments is created through charges to the provision for credit losses in order to provide appropriate reserves to absorb future estimated credit losses in accordance with gaap for further information on our processes to determine our acl see “—critical accounting estimates — allowance for credit losses” and note 5 in item 8 

summary of loan and lease loss experience 

the following table presents a summary of the changes to our alll 











1 as of december 31 2017 we enhanced the method for assessing various qualitative risks factors and events that may not be measured in the modeled results the qualitative allowance was presented within each loan class beginning in 2017 and prior periods were not reclassified to conform to the current presentation 

2 during december 2016 changes to the incurred loss period were reflected as components of the provision for retail property secured products 



allocation of the allowance for loan and lease losses 

the following table presents an allocation of the alll by class and the percent of each class of loans and leases to the total loans and leases 



1 the qualitative allowance was presented within each loan class beginning in 2017 and prior periods were not reclassified to conform to the current presentation 

the alll represented 105 of total loans and leases and 178 of nonperforming loans and leases as of december 31 2019 compared with 106 and 162  respectively as of december 31 2018  



risk elements 

the following table presents nonperforming loans and leases and loans accruing and 90 days or more past due and restructured loans and leases 



1 beginning in the fourth quarter of 2019 nonperforming balances exclude both fully and partially guaranteed residential mortgage loans sold to ginnie mae for which we have the right but not the obligation to repurchase prior periods have been adjusted to exclude partially guaranteed amounts to conform with the current period presentation 

2 tdr balances reported in this line item consist of only those tdrs not reported in the nonaccrual loan or accruing and 90 days or more delinquent loan categories thus only those tdrs that are in compliance with their modified terms and not past due or those tdrs that are past due 3089 days and still accruing are included in the tdr balances listed above 

overall credit quality remained strong across retail and commercial nonperforming loans and leases of 703 million as of december 31 2019 decrease d 63 million from december 31 2018  driven by a 107 million decrease in retail reflecting improvements in home equity education and auto that was partially offset by 44 million increase in commercial nonperforming loans net chargeoffs of 430 million increase d 113 million  or 36  from 317 million in 2018 reflecting a small number of uncorrelated losses in commercial and expected seasoning in the other retail loan portfolio net chargeoffs as a percentage of total average loans of 036 increase d 8 basis points compared to 028 in 2018  



potential problem loans and leases 

at december 31 2019  we did not identify any potential problem loans or leases within the portfolio that were not already disclosed in “—risk elements” and “—commercial loan asset quality” potential problem loans or leases consist of loans and leases where information about a borrower’s possible credit problems cause management to have serious doubts as to the ability of a borrower to comply with the present repayment terms 

commercial loan asset quality 

our commercial loan and lease portfolio consists of traditional commercial loans commercial leases and commercial real estate loans the portfolio is largely comprised of customers in our footprint and adjacent states in which we have a physical presence where our local delivery model provides for strong client connectivity we also lend nationally to companies that fall within targeted client industry and geographic expansion strategies 

for commercial loans and leases we utilize regulatory classification ratings to monitor credit quality for more information on regulatory classification ratings see note 5 in item 8 the recorded investment in commercial loans and leases based on regulatory classification ratings is presented below 





total commercial criticized loans and leases of 30 billion as of december 31 2019 increase d 199 million compared with december 31 2018  commercial criticized loans and leases as a percent of total commercial loans and leases of 53 at december 31 2019 increase d from 50 at december 31 2018  commercial criticized balances of 25 billion  or 61 of the commercial loan portfolio as of december 31 2019  increase d from 23 billion  or 55  as of december 31 2018  commercial real estate criticized balances of 353 million  or 26 of the commercial real estate portfolio decrease d from 500 million  or 38  as of december 31 2018  commercial criticized loans represented 83 of total criticized loans as of december 31 2019 compared to 80 as of december 31 2018  commercial real estate accounted for 12 of total criticized loans as of december 31 2019 compared to 18 as of december 31 2018

retail loan asset quality 

for retail loans we primarily utilize payment and delinquency status to regularly review and monitor credit quality trends historical experience indicates that the longer a loan is past due the greater the likelihood of future credit loss the largest portion of the retail portfolio is represented by borrowers located in the new england mid 



atlantic and midwest regions although we lend selectively in areas outside the footprint primarily in the auto finance education lending and unsecured portfolios 

the following tables present asset quality metrics for the retail loan portfolio 



1 the real estate secured portfolio cltv is calculated as the mortgage and second lien loan balance divided by the most recently available value of the property 

2 beginning in the fourth quarter of 2019 nonperforming balances exclude both fully and partially guaranteed residential mortgage loans sold to ginnie mae for which we have the right but not the obligation to repurchase prior periods have been adjusted to exclude partially guaranteed amounts to conform with the current period presentation 



retail asset quality remained relatively stable with december 31 2018  the net chargeoff rate of 052 for the year ended december 31 2019 reflected an increase of 4 basis points from the year ended december 31 2018  driven by expected seasoning in retail growth portfolios including personal and education refinance loans 

troubled debt restructurings 

tdr is the classification given to a loan that has been restructured in a manner that grants a concession to a borrower experiencing financial hardship that we would not otherwise make tdrs typically result from our loss mitigation efforts and are undertaken in order to improve the likelihood of recovery and continuity of the relationship our loan modifications are handled on a casebycase basis and are negotiated to achieve mutually agreeable terms that maximize loan collectability and meet our borrower’s financial needs the types of concessions include interest rate reductions term extensions principal forgiveness and other modifications to the structure of the loan that fall outside our lending policy depending on the specific facts and circumstances of the customer restructuring can involve loans moving to nonaccrual remaining on nonaccrual or remaining on accrual status 

as of december 31 2019  667 million of retail loans were classified as tdrs compared with 723 million as of december 31 2018  as of december 31 2019  143 million of retail tdrs were in nonaccrual status with 38 current with payments compared to 181 million in nonaccrual status with 49 current on payments at december 31 2018  tdrs generally return to accrual status once repayment capacity and appropriate payment history can be established tdrs are individually evaluated for impairment and loans once classified as tdrs remain classified as tdrs until paid off sold or refinanced at market terms for additional information regarding tdrs see “—critical accounting estimates — allowance for credit losses” and note 5 in item 8 



the following tables present retail tdrs by loan class including delinquency status for accruing tdrs and tdrs in nonaccrual 





impact of nonperforming loans and leases on interest income

capital and regulatory matters 

as a bank holding company and a financial holding company we are subject to regulation and supervision by the frb our banking subsidiary cbna is a national banking association whose primary federal regulator is the occ our regulation and supervision continues to evolve as the legal and regulatory frameworks governing our operations continue to change the current operating environment reflects heightened regulatory expectations around consumer compliance the bank secrecy act antimoney laundering compliance and increased internal audit activities among other factors for more information see the “regulation and supervision” section in item 1 

doddfrank act 

the doddfrank act regulates many aspects of the financial services industry and addresses among other things systemic risk capital adequacy deposit insurance assessments consumer financial protection derivatives and securities markets restrictions on an insured bank’s transactions with its affiliates lending limits and mortgage lending practices 

in october 2019 the frb and the other banking regulators finalized rules that tailor the application of the enhanced prudential standards to bank holding companies and depository institutions to implement the egrrcpa amendments to the doddfrank act “tailoring rules” concurrently the frb and other banking regulators finalized the regulatory capital liquidity and resolution plan requirements to firms with more than 100 billion in total assets category iv firms with 100 billion to 250 billion in total assets such as us will among other things be subject to biennial supervisory stresstesting and will be exempt from companyrun stress testing and related disclosure requirements the frb will continue to supervise category iv firms on an ongoing basis including evaluation of the capital adequacy and capital planning processes during offcycle years category iv firms are also no longer required to submit resolution plans for more information see the “tailoring of prudential requirements” and “resolution planning” sections in item 1 

in light of the tailoring rules the frb provided us relief in february 2019 from certain regulatory requirements related to supervisory stress testing companyrun stress testing and related disclosure requirements for the 2019 stress test cycle as a result we were not required to participate in the supervisory stress test of ccar conduct companyrun stress tests or submit a capital plan to the frb for 2019 we remain subject to the requirement to develop and maintain an annual capital plan that is reviewed and approved by our board of directors or one of its committees as well as fr y14 reporting requirements the frb has not objected to our maximum planned capital actions for the period beginning july 1 2019 and ending june 30 2020 which are largely based on the results for our 2018 supervisory stress test adjusted for any changes in our regulatory capital ratios since the frb acted on our 2018 capital plan on june 27 2019 our board of directors authorized common share repurchases of up to 1275 billion over the fourquarter period beginning july 1 2019 the timing and exact amount of future share repurchases will depend on various factors including capital position financial performance and market conditions 

  



capital framework 

under the current us basel iii capital framework we and our banking subsidiary must meet the following specific minimum requirements cet1 capital ratio of 45 tier 1 capital ratio of 60 total capital ratio of 80 and tier 1 leverage ratio of 40 a capital conservation buffer “ccb” of 25 is imposed on top of the three minimum riskbased capital ratios listed above 

in july 2019 the frb and the other federal banking regulators issued a final rule to simplify regulatory capital treatment for msrs certain dtas and significant investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions pursuant to egrrcpa effective for us on april 1 2020 the final rule will change the individual cet1 deduction threshold for these assets from 10 to 25 eliminate the aggregate deduction threshold for these assets of 15 assign a 250 risk weight for any msrs or dtas not deducted from cet1 capital and assign an exposure category risk weight for investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions not deducted from cet1 capital 

the table below presents our actual regulatory capital ratios under the us basel iii standardized rules 



1 required “minimum capital ratio” for 2019 and 2018 are common equity tier 1 capital of 45 tier 1 capital of 60 total capital of 80 and tier 1 leverage of 40 

2 “minimum capital ratio” includes capital conservation buffer of 2500 for 2019 and 1875 for 2018 na to tier 1 leverage 

at december 31 2019  our cet1 capital tier 1 capital and total capital ratios were 100  111 and 130  respectively as compared with 106  113 and 133  respectively as of december 31 2018  the cet1 capital ratio decreased as 67 billion of riskweighted asset “rwa” growth the impact of the capital actions described in “—capital transactions” below and an increase in goodwill and intangibles related to acquisitions were partially offset by net income for the year ended december 31 2019  the tier 1 capital ratio decreased as the changes in the cet1 capital ratio were partially offset by the issuance of preferred stock as described further in “—capital transactions” below the total capital ratio decreased due to the changes in cet1 and tier 1 capital ratios and an increase in nonqualifying subordinated debt at december 31 2019  our cet1 capital tier 1 capital and total capital ratios were approximately 300 basis points 260 basis points and 250 basis points respectively above their regulatory minimums plus the capital conservation buffer all ratios remained well above the us basel iii minima 

regulatory capital ratios and capital composition 

cet1 capital under us basel iii standardized rules totaled 143 billion at december 31 2019  and decreased 181 million from 145 billion at december 31 2018  as common share repurchases dividends and an increase in goodwill and intangibles related to acquisitions were partially offset by net income for the year ended december 31 2019  tier 1 capital at december 31 2019 totaled 159 billion  reflecting a 549 million increase from 153 billion at december 31 2018  driven by the changes in cet1 capital and the issuance of preferred stock at december 31 2019  we had 16 billion of noncumulative perpetual preferred stock issued and outstanding an increase of 730 million from 840 million at december 31 2018  given the first quarter 2019 issuance of 300000 shares of series d preferred stock and the fourth quarter 2019 issuance of 450000 shares of series e preferred 



stock that qualified as additional tier 1 capital total capital of 185 billion at december 31 2019  increased 385 million from december 31 2018  driven by the changes in cet1 and tier 1 capital and an increase in nonqualifying subordinated debt 

rwa totaled 1429 billion at december 31 2019  based on us basel iii standardized rules up 67 billion from december 31 2018  this increase was driven by growth in retail loans including education residential mortgages and unsecured retail portfolios as well as higher commercial loans and commitments higher derivative valuations and multifamily loans the increase in rwa was also driven by the creation of a rightofuse asset in conjunction with the adoption of asu 201602 leases topic 842 and market risk rwa as we met the reporting threshold prescribed by market risk capital guidelines these increases were partially offset by runoff in the home equity portfolio and lower investment securities 

as of december 31 2019  the tier 1 leverage ratio was 100 and was stable with december 31 2018 as the 58 billion increase in quarterly adjusted average assets was offset by the increase in tier 1 capital 

the following table presents our capital composition under the us basel iii capital framework 



1 as a us basel iii standardized approach institution we selected the onetime election to optout of the requirements to include all the components of aoci 

2 as of december 31 2019 and 2018  the amount of nonqualifying subordinated debt excluded from regulatory capital was 267 million and 139 million respectively 

capital adequacy process 

our assessment of capital adequacy begins with our risk appetite and risk management framework this framework provides for the identification measurement and management of material risks capital requirements are determined for actual and forecasted risk portfolios using applicable regulatory capital methodologies the assessment also considers the possible impacts of approved and proposed changes to regulatory capital requirements key analytical frameworks including stress testing which enable the assessment of capital adequacy versus unexpected loss under a variety of stress scenarios supplement our base line forecast a governance framework supports our capital planning process including capital management policies and procedures that document capital adequacy metrics and limits as well as our capital contingency plan and the active engagement of both the legalentity boards and senior management in oversight and decisionmaking 

forwardlooking assessments of capital adequacy feed development of a single capital plan covering us and our banking subsidiary that is periodically submitted to the frb we prepare this plan in full compliance with the frb’s capital plan rule and we participate annually in the frb’s horizontal capital review which is the frb’s assessment of specific capital planning areas as part of their normal supervisory process 

all distributions proposed under our capital plan are subject to consideration and approval by our board of directors prior to execution the timing and exact amount of future dividends and share repurchases will depend on various factors including our capital position financial performance and market conditions 



capital transactions 

we completed t he following capital actions during 2019 

 banking subsidiary’s capital 

the following table presents cbna’s capital ratios under us basel iii standardized rules 



cbna cet1 capital totaled 156 billion at december 31 2019  up 36 billion from 120 billion at december 31 2018  the increase was primarily driven by the net impact of the merger of cbpa into cbna effective january 2 2019 and net income for the year ended december 31 2019  the increase was partially offset by dividend payments to the parent company and an increase in goodwill and intangibles related acquisitions total capital was 179 billion at december 31 2019  an increase of 37 billion from december 31 2018  driven by the change in cet1 capital an increase in the acl primarily attributable to the merger and slightly offset by an increase in nonqualifying subordinated debt 

cbna had rwa of 1426 billion at december 31 2019  an increase of 289 billion from december 31 2018 driven primarily by the merger of cbpa into cbna in addition to growth in retail loans commercial loans and commitments and higher derivative valuations rwa was also increased by the creation of a rightofuse asset in conjunction with the adoption of asu 201602 leases topic 842 and market risk rwa as we met the reporting threshold prescribed by market risk capital guidelines these increases were partially offset by runoff in the home equity portfolio and certain sales of investment securities 

as of december 31 2019  the cbna tier 1 leverage ratio was 99 and was stable with december 31 2018 as the 367 billion increase in quarterly adjusted average assets was offset by the increase in tier 1 capital 



liquidity 

liquidity is defined as our ability to meet our cash flow and collateral obligations in a timely manner at a reasonable cost an institution must maintain operating liquidity to meet its expected daily and forecasted cash flow requirements as well as contingent liquidity to meet unexpected stress scenario funding requirements as noted earlier reflecting the importance of meeting all unexpected and stress scenario funding requirements we identify and manage contingent liquidity consisting of cash balances at the frb unencumbered highquality and liquid securities and unused fhlb borrowing capacity separately we also identify and manage asset liquidity cash balances at the frb and unencumbered securities as a subset of contingent liquidity asset liquidity and undrawn fhlb capacity we consider the effective and prudent management of liquidity to be fundamental to our financial health and strength 

we manage liquidity at the consolidated enterprise level and at each material legal entity including at the parent company and cbna level 

parent company liquidity 

our parent company’s primary sources of cash are dividends and interest received from cbna as a result of investing in bank equity and subordinated debt and externally issued preferred stock as well as senior and subordinated debt uses of cash include the routine cash flow requirements as a bank holding company including periodic share repurchases and payments of dividends interest and expenses the needs of subsidiaries including cbna for additional equity and as required its need for debt financing and the support for extraordinary funding requirements when necessary to the extent the parent company has relied on wholesale borrowings uses also include payments of related principal and interest 

on january 29 2019 the parent company issued 300 million  or 12000000 depositary shares each representing a 140th interest in a share of its 6350 fixedtofloating rate noncumulative perpetual series d preferred stock par value of 2500 per share with a liquidation preference of 1000 per share equivalent to 25 per depositary share for further information see note 16 in item 8 

on july 25 2019 the parent company issued 500 million in sevenyear 2850 fixedrate senior notes 

on october 28 2019 the parent company issued 450 million  or 18000000 depositary shares each representing a 140th interest in a share of its 5000 fixedrate noncumulative perpetual series e preferred stock par value of 2500 per share with a liquidation preference of 1000 per share equivalent to 25 per depositary share for further information see note 16 in item 8 

on february 6 2020 the parent company issued 300 million in tenyear 2500 fixedrate senior notes 

for further information on outstanding debt and preferred stock see note 12 and note 16 in item 8 

during the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018  the parent company declared and paid dividends on common stock of 617 million and 471 million  respectively and declared dividends on preferred stock of 73 million and 29 million  respectively in addition the parent company repurchased 1220 billion and 1025 billion of its outstanding common stock respectively 

our parent company’s cash and cash equivalents represent a source of liquidity that can be used to meet various needs and totaled 14 billion as of december 31 2019 compared with 911 million as of december 31 2018  the parent company’s doubleleverage ratio the combined equity investment in parent company subsidiaries divided by parent company equity is a measure of reliance on equity cash flows from subsidiaries to fund parent company obligations at december 31 2019  the parent company’s doubleleverage ratio was 99  

cbna liquidity 

in the ordinary course of business the liquidity of cbna is managed by matching sources and uses of cash the primary sources of bank liquidity include deposits from our consumer and commercial customers payments of principal and interest on loans and debt securities and wholesale borrowings as needed and as described under “—liquidity risk management and governance” the primary uses of bank liquidity include withdrawals and maturities of deposits payment of interest on deposits funding of loans and related commitments and funding of securities purchases to the extent that cbna has relied on wholesale borrowings uses also include payments of related principal and interest for further information on cbna’s outstanding debt see note 12 in item 8 

as cbna’s major businesses involve taking deposits and making loans a key role of liquidity management is to ensure that customers have timely access to funds from deposits and for loans liquidity management also involves 



maintaining sufficient liquidity to repay wholesale borrowings pay operating expenses and support extraordinary funding requirements when necessary 

on february 14 2019 cbna issued 15 billion in senior notes consisting of 700 million in threeyear 3250 fixedrate notes 300 million in threeyear floatingrate notes and 500 million in sevenyear 3750 fixedrate notes 

liquidity risk 

we define liquidity risk as the risk that an entity will be unable to meet its payment obligations in a timely manner at a reasonable cost liquidity risk can arise due to contingent liquidity risk andor funding liquidity risk 

contingent liquidity risk is the risk that market conditions may reduce an entity’s ability to liquidate pledge andor finance certain assets and thereby substantially reduce the liquidity value of such assets drivers of contingent liquidity risk include general market disruptions as well as specific issues regarding the credit quality andor valuation of a security or loan issuer or borrower andor asset class 

funding liquidity risk is the risk that market conditions andor entityspecific events may reduce an entity’s ability to raise funds from depositors andor wholesale market counterparties drivers of funding liquidity risk may be idiosyncratic or systemic reflecting impediments to operations andor damaged market confidence 

factors affecting liquidity 

given the composition of assets and borrowing sources contingent liquidity risk at cbna would be materially affected by events such as deterioration of financing markets for highquality securities eg mortgagebacked securities and other instruments issued by the gnma fnma and the fhlmc by any inability of the fhlbs to provide collateralized advances andor by a refusal of the frb to act as a lender of last resort in systemic stress 

similarly given the structure of its balance sheet the funding liquidity risk of cbna would be materially affected by an adverse idiosyncratic event eg a major loss causing a perceived or actual deterioration in its financial condition an adverse systemic event eg default or bankruptcy of a significant capital markets participant or a combination of both consequently and despite ongoing exposure to a variety of idiosyncratic and systemic events we view our contingent liquidity risk and our funding liquidity risk to be relatively modest 

an additional variable affecting our access to unsecured wholesale market funds and to large denomination ie uninsured customer deposits is the credit ratings assigned by such agencies as moody’s standard  poor’s and fitch the following table presents our credit ratings 



nr  not rated 

changes in our public credit ratings could affect both the cost and availability of our wholesale funding as a result and in order to maintain a conservative funding profile cbna continues to minimize reliance on unsecured wholesale funding at december 31 2019  our wholesale funding consisted primarily of secured borrowings from the fhlbs collateralized by highquality residential mortgages and term debt issued by the parent company and cbna 

existing and evolving regulatory liquidity requirements represent another key driver of systemic liquidity conditions and liquidity management practices the frb the occ and the fdic regularly evaluate our liquidity as part of the overall supervisory process in addition we are subject to existing and evolving regulatory liquidity requirements some of which are subject to further rulemaking guidance and interpretation by the applicable 



federal regulators for further discussion see the “regulation and supervision — financial regulatory reform” and “—liquidity requirements” sections in item 1 

the lcr was developed by the us federal banking regulators to ensure banks have sufficient highquality liquid assets to cover expected net cash outflows over a 30day liquidity stress period in accordance with the october 2019 final rules category iv institutions with less than 50 billion in weighted shortterm wholesale funding such as us are no longer subject to the requirements of the lcr rule as of december 31 2019 

liquidity risk management and governance 

liquidity risk is measured and managed by the funding and liquidity unit within our treasury unit in accordance with policy guidelines promulgated by our board and the asset liability committee in managing liquidity risk the funding and liquidity unit delivers regular and comprehensive reporting including current levels versus threshold limits for a broad set of liquidity metrics and early warning indicators explanatory commentary relating to emerging risk trends and as appropriate recommended remedial strategies 

our funding and liquidity unit’s primary goal is to deliver and otherwise maintain prudent levels of operating liquidity to support expected and projected funding requirements and contingent liquidity to support unexpected funding requirements resulting from idiosyncratic systemic and combination stress events and regulatory liquidity requirements in a timely manner from stable and costefficient funding sources 

we seek to accomplish this goal by funding loans with stable deposits by prudently controlling dependence on wholesale funding particularly shortterm unsecured funding and by maintaining ample available liquidity including a contingent liquidity buffer of unencumbered highquality loans and securities as of december 31 2019  

 the funding and liquidity unit monitors a variety of liquidity and funding metrics and early warning indicators and metrics including specific risk thresholds limits these monitoring tools are broadly classified as follows 

 further certain of these metrics are monitored individually for cbna and for our consolidated enterprise on a daily basis including cash position unencumbered securities asset liquidity and available fhlb borrowing capacity in order to identify emerging trends and risks and inform funding decisions specific metrics are also forecasted over a oneyear horizon 

  



contractual obligations 

the following table presents our outstanding contractual obligations as of december 31 2019  



1 deposits and longterm borrowed funds exclude interest 

2 includes demand checking with interest regular savings and money market account deposits see “—deposits” for further information 

3 includes obligations under capital leases 

4 includes accrued interest and future contractual interest obligations related to longterm borrowed funds 

5 includes purchase obligations for goods and services covered by noncancelable contracts and contracts including cancellation fees 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

the following table presents our outstanding offbalance sheet arrangements for further information see note 18 in item 8 



critical accounting estimates 

our audited consolidated financial statements which are included in this report are prepared in accordance with gaap the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to establish accounting policies and make estimates that affect amounts reported in our audited consolidated financial statements 

an accounting estimate requires assumptions and judgments about uncertain matters that could have a material effect on our audited consolidated financial statements estimates are made using facts and circumstances known at a point in time changes in those facts and circumstances could produce results substantially different from those estimates our most significant accounting policies and estimates and their related application are discussed below see note 1 in item 8 for further discussion of our significant accounting policies 

allowance for credit losses 

management’s estimate of probable losses in our loan and lease portfolios including unfunded lending commitments is recorded in the alll and the reserve for unfunded lending commitments at levels that we believe to be appropriate as of the balance sheet date the reserve for unfunded lending commitments is reported as a component of other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets our determination of such estimates is based on a periodic evaluation of the loan and lease portfolios and unfunded credit facilities as well as other relevant factors this evaluation is inherently subjective and requires significant estimates and judgments of underlying factors all of which are susceptible to change 

the alll and reserve for unfunded lending commitments could be affected by a variety of internal and external factors internal factors include portfolio performance such as delinquency levels assigned risk ratings the mix and level of loan balances differing economic risks associated with each loan category and the financial condition of specific borrowers external factors include fluctuations in the general economy unemployment rates bankruptcy filings developments within a particular industry changes in collateral values and factors particular to 



a specific commercial credit such as competition business and management performance the alll may be adjusted to reflect our current assessment of various qualitative risks factors and events that may not be measured in our statistical procedures there is no certainty that the alll and reserve for unfunded lending commitments will be appropriate over time to cover losses because of unanticipated adverse changes in any of these internal external or qualitative factors there were no material changes in assumptions or estimation techniques compared with prior years that impacted the determination of the current year’s alll and the reserve for unfunded lending commitments 

the evaluation of the adequacy of the commercial commercial real estate and lease alll and reserve for unfunded lending commitments is primarily based on risk rating models that assess probability of default “pd” loss given default “lgd” and exposure at default on an individual loan basis the models are primarily driven by individual customer financial characteristics and are validated against historical experience additionally qualitative factors are included in the risk rating models after the aggregation of individual borrower incurred loss additional overlays can be made based on backtesting against historical losses and forward loss curve ratios 

for nonaccruing commercial and commercial real estate loans with an outstanding balance of 3 million or greater and for all commercial and commercial real estate tdrs regardless of size we conduct specific analysis on a loan level basis to determine the probable amount of credit loss if appropriate a specific alll is established for the loan through a charge to the provision for credit losses for all classes of impaired loans individual loan measures of impairment may result in a chargeoff to the alll if deemed appropriate in such cases the provision for credit losses is not affected when a specific reserve for at least that amount already exists techniques utilized include comparing the loan’s carrying amount to the estimated present value of its future cash flows the fair value of its underlying collateral or the loan’s observable market price the technique applied to each impaired loan is based on the workout officer’s opinion of the most probable workout scenario historically this has generally led to the use of the estimated present value of future cash flows approach the fair value of underlying collateral will be used if the loan is deemed collateral dependent for loans that use the fair value of underlying collateral approach a chargeoff assessment is performed quarterly to write the loans down for declines in value to fair value less cost to sell 

for most nonimpaired retail loan portfolio types the alll is based upon the incurred loss model utilizing the pd lgd and exposure at default on an individual loan basis when developing these factors we may consider the loan product and collateral type delinquency status ltv ratio lien position borrower’s credit time outstanding geographic location and incurred loss period incurred loss periods are reviewed and updated at least annually and potentially more frequently when economic situations change rapidly as they tend to fluctuate with economic cycles incurred loss periods are generally longer in good economic times and shorter in bad times certain retail portfolios including education unsecured personal loans sbo home equity loans and credit card receivables utilize roll rate or vintage models to estimate the alll 

for home equity lines and loans a number of factors impact the pd specifically the borrower’s current fico score the utilization rate delinquency statistics borrower income current cltv ratio and months on books are all used to assess the borrower’s creditworthiness similarly lgd is also impacted by various factors including the utilization rate the cltv ratio the lien position the housing price index change for the location as measured by the caseshiller index age of the loan and current loan balance 

when we are not in a first lien position we use delinquency information on the first lien exposures obtained from thirdparty credit information providers in the credit assessment for all first liens whether owned by a third party or by us an additional assessment is performed on a quarterly basis in this assessment the most recent three months’ performance of the senior liens is reviewed for delinquency 90 days or more past due modification foreclosure andor bankruptcy statuses if any derogatory status is present the junior lien will be placed on nonaccrual status regardless of its delinquency status on our books this subsequent change to nonaccrual status will alter the treatment in the pd model thus affecting the reserve calculation 

in addition the first lien exposure is combined with the second lien exposure to generate a cltv the cltv is a more accurate reflection of the leverage of the borrower against the property value as compared to the ltv from just the junior liens the cltv is used for modeling both the junior lien pd and lgd this also impacts the alll rates for the junior lien helocs 

the above measures are all used to assess the pd and lgd for heloc borrowers for whom we originated the loans 

for retail tdrs that are not collateraldependent allowances are developed using the present value of expected future cash flows compared to the recorded investment in the loans expected redefault factors are considered in this analysis retail tdrs that are deemed collateraldependent are written down to the fair market 



value of the collateral less costs to sell the fair value of collateral is periodically monitored subsequent to the modification 

changes in the levels of estimated losses can significantly affect management’s determination of an appropriate alll for retail loans losses are affected by such factors as loss severity collateral values economic conditions and other factors a one basis point and five basis point increase in the estimated loss rate for retail loans at december 31 2019 would have increased the alll by 6 million and 31 million respectively the alll for our commercial banking segment is sensitive to assigned credit risk ratings and inherent loss rates if 10 and 20 of the december 31 2019 year end loan balances including unfunded commitments within each risk rating category of our commercial banking segment had experienced downgrades of two risk categories the alll would have increased by 66 million and 126 million respectively 

commercial loans and leases are charged off to the alll when there is little prospect of collecting either principal or interest chargeoffs of commercial loans and leases usually involve receipt of borrowerspecific adverse information for commercial collateraldependent loans an appraisal or other valuation is used to quantify a shortfall between the fair value of the collateral less costs to sell and the recorded investment in the commercial loan retail loan chargeoffs are generally based on established delinquency thresholds rather than borrowerspecific adverse information when a loan is collateraldependent any shortfalls between the fair value of the collateral less costs to sell and the recorded investment is promptly charged off placing any loan or lease on nonaccrual status does not by itself require a partial or total chargeoff however any identified losses are charged off at that time 

for additional information regarding the alll and reserve for unfunded lending commitments see note 1 and note 5 in item 8 

fair value 

we measure fair value using the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date fair value is based upon quoted market prices in an active market where available if quoted prices are not available observable marketbased inputs or independently sourced parameters are used to develop fair value whenever possible such inputs may include prices of similar assets or liabilities yield curves interest rates prepayment speeds and foreign exchange rates 

we classify our assets and liabilities that are carried at fair value in accordance with the threelevel valuation hierarchy 

 classification in the hierarchy is based upon the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement of the asset or liability for instruments classified in level 1 and 2 where inputs are primarily based upon observable market data there is less judgment applied in arriving at the fair value for instruments classified in level 3 management judgment is more significant due to the lack of observable market data 

we review and update the fair value hierarchy classifications on a quarterly basis changes from one quarter to the next related to the observability of inputs in fair value measurements may result in a reclassification between the fair value hierarchy levels and are recognized based on yearend balances we also verify the accuracy of the pricing provided by our primary external pricing service on a quarterly basis this process involves using a secondary external vendor to provide valuations for our securities portfolio for comparison purposes any securities with discrepancies beyond a certain threshold are researched and if necessary valued by an independent outside broker 

fair value is also used on a nonrecurring basis to evaluate certain assets for impairment or for disclosure purposes examples of nonrecurring uses of fair value include mortgage servicing rights accounted for by the amortization method loan impairments for certain loans and goodwill 

the fair value of assets under operating leases is determined using collateral specific pricing digests external appraisals broker opinions recent sales data from industry equipment dealers and the discounted cash flows 



derived from the underlying lease agreement as market data for similar assets and lease agreements is available and used in the valuation these assets are classified as level 2 

msrs do not trade in an active market with readily observable prices msrs are classified as level 3 since the valuation methodology utilizes significant unobservable inputs the fair value was calculated using a discounted cash flow model which used assumptions including weightedaverage life prepayment assumptions and weightedaverage option adjusted spread it is important to note that changes in our assumptions may not be independent of each other changes in one assumption may result in changes to another eg changes in interest rates which are inversely correlated to changes in prepayment rates may result in changes to discount rates which could impact sensitivities the underlying assumptions and estimated values are corroborated by values received from independent third parties based on their review of the servicing portfolio and comparisons to market transactions in addition the msr policy is approved by the asset liability committee

risk governance 

we are committed to maintaining a strong integrated and proactive approach to the management of all risks to which we are exposed in pursuit of our business objectives a key aspect of our board’s responsibility as the main decision making body is setting our risk appetite to ensure that the levels of risk that we are willing to accept in the attainment of our strategic business and financial objectives are clearly understood 

to enable our board to carry out its objectives it has delegated authority for risk management activities as well as governance and oversight of those activities to a number of board and executive management level risk committees the executive risk committee “erc” chaired by the chief risk officer is responsible for oversight of risk across the enterprise and actively considers our inherent material risks analyzes our overall risk profile and seeks confirmation that the risks are being appropriately identified assessed and mitigated reporting to the erc are the following additional committees covering specific areas of risk compliance and operational risk committee model risk committee credit policy committee asset liability committee business initiatives review committee and the conduct and ethics committee 

risk framework 

our risk management framework is embedded in our business through a “three lines of defense” model which defines responsibilities and accountabilities for risk management activities 

first line of defense 

the business lines including their associated support functions are the first line of defense and are accountable for identifying assessing managing and controlling the risks associated with the products and services they provide the business lines are responsible for performing regular risk assessments to identify and assess the material risks that arise in their area of responsibility complying with relevant risk policies testing and certifying the adequacy and effectiveness of their operational and financial reporting controls on a regular basis establishing and documenting operating procedures and establishing and owning a governance structure for identifying and managing risk 

second line of defense 

the second line of defense includes independent monitoring and control functions accountable for developing and ensuring implementation of risk and control frameworks and related policies this centralized risk function is appropriately independent from the business and is accountable for overseeing and challenging our business lines on the effective management of their risks including credit market operational regulatory reputational interest rate liquidity and strategic risks 

third line of defense 

our internal audit function is the third line of defense providing independent assurance with a view of the effectiveness of our internal controls governance practices and culture so that risk is managed appropriately for the size complexity and risk profile of the organization internal audit has complete and unrestricted access to any and all of our records physical properties and personnel internal audit issues a report following each internal review and provides an audit opinion to the board’s audit committee on a quarterly basis 

credit quality assurance reports to the chief audit executive and provides the legalentity boards senior management and other stakeholders with independent assurance on the quality of credit portfolios and adherence to agreed credit risk appetite and credit policies and processes in line with its procedures and regulatory expectations the credit quality assurance function undertakes a program of portfolio testing assessing and reporting through four risk pillars of asset quality rating and data integrity risk management and credit risk appetite 

risk appetite 

risk appetite is a strategic business and risk management tool we define our risk appetite as the maximum limit of acceptable risk beyond which we could be unable to achieve our strategic objectives and capital adequacy obligations 

our principal nonmarket risks include credit operational regulatory reputational liquidity and strategic risks we are also subject to certain market risks which include potential losses arising from changes in interest rates foreign exchange rates equity prices commodity prices andor other relevant market rates or prices market risk in our business arises from trading activities that serve customer needs including hedging of interest rates foreign exchange risk and nontrading activities within capital markets we have established enterprisewide policies 



and methodologies to identify measure monitor and report on market risk we actively manage both trading and nontrading market risks see “—market risk” for further information our risk appetite is reviewed and approved annually by the board risk committee 

credit risk 

overview 

credit risk represents the potential for loss arising from a customer counterparty or issuer failing to perform in accordance with the contractual terms of the obligation while the majority of our credit risk is associated with lending activities we do engage with other financial counterparties for a variety of purposes including investing asset and liability management and trading activities given the financial impact of credit risk on our earnings and balance sheet the assessment approval and management of credit risk represents a major part of our overall riskmanagement responsibility 

objective 

the independent credit risk function is responsible for reviewing and approving credit risk appetite across all lines of business and credit products approving larger and higher risk credit transactions monitoring portfolio performance identifying problem credit exposures and ensuring remedial management 

organizational structure 

management and oversight of credit risk is the responsibility of both the business line and the second line of defense the second line of defense the independent credit risk function is led by the chief credit officer who oversees all of our credit risk the chief credit officer reports to the chief risk officer the chief credit officer acting in a manner consistent with board policies has responsibility for among other things the governance process around policies procedures risk acceptance criteria credit risk appetite limits and authority delegation the chief credit officer and team also have responsibility for credit approvals for larger and higher risk transactions and oversight of line of business credit risk activities reporting to the chief credit officer are the heads of the second line of defense credit functions specializing in consumer banking commercial banking citizens restructuring management portfolio and corporate reporting alll analytics current expected credit loss and credit policy and administration each team under these leaders is composed of highly experienced credit professionals 

governance 

the primary mechanisms used to govern our credit risk function are our consumer and commercial credit policies these policies outline the minimum acceptable lending standards that align with our desired risk appetite material changes in our business model and strategies that identify a need to change our risk appetite or highlight a risk not previously contemplated are identified by the individual committees and presented to the credit policy committee executive risk committee and the board risk committee for approval as appropriate 

key management processes 

we employ a comprehensive and integrated risk control program to proactively identify measure monitor and mitigate existing and emerging credit risks across the credit life cycle origination account managementportfolio management and loss mitigation and recovery 

consumer 

on the consumer banking side of credit risk our teams use models to evaluate consumer loans across the life cycle of the loan starting at origination credit scoring models are used to forecast the probability of default of an applicant when approving customers for a new loan or extension of an existing credit line credit scores are used in conjunction with other credit risk variables such as affordability length of term collateral value collateral type and lien subordination 

to ensure proper oversight of the underwriting teams lending authority is granted by the second line of defense credit risk function to each underwriter the amount of delegated authority depends on the experience of the individual we periodically evaluate the performance of each underwriter and annually reauthorize their delegated authority only senior members of the second line of defense credit risk team are authorized to approve significant exceptions to credit policies it is not uncommon to make exceptions to established policies when compensating factors are present there are exception limits which when reached trigger a comprehensive analysis 



once an account is established credit scores and collateral values are refreshed at regular intervals to allow for proactive identification of increasing or decreasing levels of credit risk our approach to managing credit risk is highly analytical and where appropriate is automated to ensure consistency and efficiency 

commercial 

on the commercial banking side of credit risk the structure is broken into ci loans and leases and cre within ci loans and leases there are separate verticals established for certain specialty products eg assetbased lending leasing franchise finance health care and technology midcorporate a “specialty vertical” is a standalone team of industry or product specialists substantially all activity that falls under the ambit of the defined industry or product is managed through a specialty vertical when one exists cre also operates as a specialty vertical 

commercial credit risk management begins with defined credit products and policies 

commercial transactions are subject to individual analysis and approval at origination and with few exceptions are subject to a formal annual review requirement the underwriting process includes the establishment and approval of credit grades that confirm the pd and lgd all material transactions then require the approval of both a business line approver and an independent credit approver with the requisite level of delegated authority the approval level of a particular credit facility is determined by the size of the credit relationship as well as the pd the checks and balances in the credit process and the independence of the credit approver function are designed to appropriately assess and sanction the level of credit risk being accepted facilitate the early recognition of credit problems when they occur and to provide for effective problem asset management and resolution all authority to grant credit is delegated through the independent credit risk function and is closely monitored and regularly updated 

the primary factors considered in commercial credit approvals are the financial strength of the borrower assessment of the borrower’s management capabilities cash flows from operations industry sector trends type and sufficiency of collateral type of exposure transaction structure and the general economic outlook while these are the primary factors considered there are a number of other factors that may be considered in the decision process in addition to the credit analysis conducted during the approval process at origination and annual review our credit quality assurance group performs testing to provide an independent review and assessment of the quality of the portfolio and new originations this group conducts portfolio reviews on a riskbased cycle to evaluate individual loans and validate risk ratings as well as test the consistency of the credit processes and the effectiveness of credit risk management 

the maximum level of credit exposure to individual credit borrowers is limited by policy guidelines based on the perceived risk of each borrower or related group of borrowers concentration risk is managed through limits on industry asset class and loan quality factors we focus predominantly on extending credit to commercial customers with existing or expandable relationships within our primary markets for this purpose defined as our 11 state footprint plus contiguous states although we do engage in lending opportunities outside our primary markets if we believe that the associated risks are acceptable and aligned with strategic initiatives 

substantially all loans categorized as classified are managed by a specialized group of credit professionals 

market risk 

market risk refers to potential losses arising from changes in interest rates foreign exchange rates equity prices commodity prices andor other relevant market rates or prices modest market risk arises from trading activities that serve customer needs including hedging of interest rate and foreign exchange risk as described below more material market risk arises from our nontrading banking activities such as loan origination and depositgathering we have established enterprisewide policies and methodologies to identify measure monitor and report market risk we actively manage market risk for both trading and nontrading activities 

nontrading risk 

we are exposed to market risk as a result of nontrading banking activities this market risk is substantially composed of interest rate risk as we have no commodity risk and de minimis direct currency and equity risk we also have market risk related to capital markets loan originations as well as the valuation of our msrs  

interest rate risk 

interest rate risk emerges from the balance sheet after the aggregation of our assets liabilities and equity we refer to this nontrading risk embedded in the balance sheet as “structural interest rate risk” or “interest rate risk in the banking book” 



a major source of structural interest rate risk is a difference in the repricing of assets relative to liabilities and equity there are differences in the timing and drivers of rate changes reflecting the maturity andor repricing of assets and liabilities for example the rate earned on a commercial loan may reprice monthly with changes in libor while the rate paid on debt or certificates of deposit may be fixed for a longer period there may also be differences in the drivers of rate changes loans may be tied to a specific index rate such as libor or prime while deposits may be only loosely correlated with libor and dependent upon competitive demand due to these basis differences net interest income is sensitive to changes in spreads between certain indices or repricing rates 

another important source of structural interest rate risk relates to the potential exercise of explicit or embedded options for example most consumer loans can be prepaid without penalty and most consumer deposits can also be withdrawn without penalty the exercise of such options by customers can exacerbate the timing differences discussed above 

a primary source of our structural interest rate risk relates to faster repricing of floatingrate loans relative to retail deposit funding this source of asset sensitivity is more biased toward the short end of the yield curve after a period of slowly raising shortterm rates to a more neutral stance the frb adjusted their policy stance with a midcycle adjustment reducing short term rates by 75 basis points in 2019 as this shift occurred we reduced our asset sensitivity to a more moderate level to account for the less certain outlook for policy rates 

the secondary source of our interest rate risk is driven by longer term rates comprising the rollover or reinvestment risk on fixedrate loans as well as prepayment risk on mortgagerelated loans and securities funded by nonrate sensitive deposits and equity 

the primary goal of interest rate risk management is to control exposure to interest rate risk within policy limits approved by our board these limits and guidelines reflect our tolerance for interest rate risk over both shortterm and longterm horizons to ensure that exposure to interest rate risk is managed within our risk appetite we must measure the exposure and hedge it as necessary the treasury asset and liability management team is responsible for measuring monitoring and reporting on our structural interest rate risk position these exposures are reported on a monthly basis to the asset liability committee and at board meetings 

we measure structural interest rate risk through a variety of metrics intended to quantify both shortterm and longterm exposures the primary method we use to quantify interest rate risk is simulation analysis in which we model net interest income from assets liabilities and hedge derivative positions under various interest rate scenarios over a threeyear horizon exposure to interest rate risk is reflected in the variation of forecasted net interest income across the scenarios 

key assumptions in this simulation analysis relate to the behavior of interest rates and spreads the changes in product balances and the behavior of loan and deposit clients in different rate environments the most material of these behavioral assumptions relate to the repricing characteristics and balance fluctuations of deposits with indeterminate ie noncontractual maturities as well as the pace of mortgage prepayments assessments are periodically made by running sensitivity analyses to determine the impact of key assumptions the results of these analyses are reported to the asset liability committee 

as the future path of interest rates cannot be known in advance we use simulation analysis to project net interest income under various interest rate scenarios including a “most likely” implied forward scenario as well as a variety of deliberately extreme and perhaps unlikely scenarios these scenarios may assume gradual ramping of the overall level of interest rates immediate shocks to the level of rates and various yield curve twists in which movements in short or longterm rates predominate generally projected net interest income in any interest rate scenario is compared to net interest income in a base case where market forward rates are realized 

the table below reports net interest income exposures against a variety of interest rate scenarios our policies involve measuring exposures as a percentage change in net interest income over the next year due to either instantaneous or gradual parallel changes in rates relative to the market implied forward yield curve as the following table illustrates our balance sheet is assetsensitive net interest income would benefit from an increase in interest rates while exposure to a decline in interest rates is within limit while an instantaneous and severe shift in interest rates was used in this analysis we believe that any actual shift in interest rates would likely be more gradual and therefore have a more modest impact 



the table below presents the sensitivity of net interest income to various parallel yield curve shifts from the market implied forward yield curve 



  

given broad expectations that the frb will maintain its current policy stance we continue to manage asset sensitivity within the scope of our policy and changing market conditions asset sensitivity against a 200 basis point gradual increase in rates was 32 at december 31 2019  compared with 49 at december 31 2018  additionally approximately 75 to 80 of this asset sensitivity is tied to longterm interest rate exposure greater than six months the risk position can be affected by changes in interest rates which impact the repricing sensitivity or beta of the deposit base as well as the cash flows on assets that allow for early payoff without a penalty the risk position is managed within our risk limits and long term view of interest rates through occasional adjustments to securities investments interest rate swaps and mix of funding 

we use a valuation measure of exposure to structural interest rate risk economic value of equity “eve” as a supplement to net interest income simulations eve complements net interest income simulation analysis as it estimates risk exposure over a longterm horizon eve measures the extent to which the economic value of assets liabilities and offbalance sheet instruments may change in response to fluctuations in interest rates this analysis is highly dependent upon assumptions applied to assets and liabilities with noncontractual maturities the change in value is expressed as a percentage of regulatory capital 

we use interest rate swap contracts to manage the interest rate exposure to variability in the interest cash flows on our floatingrate assets and floatingrate wholesale funding and to hedge market risk on fixedrate capital markets debt issuances the table below summarizes the related hedging activities 



1 in 2019  we reduced asset sensitivity over the december 2019 to december 2021 period with the addition of 18 billion of december 2019 forward starting 

receivefixed interest rate swaps as part of an ongoing program to manage interest rate risk 

2 in 2019  we executed a lastoflayer hedge utilizing payfixed interest rate swap agreements to manage the interest rate exposure on mortgagebacked 

securities held in our available for sale debt securities portfolio as of december 31 2019  the notional and fair value of these hedges was 20 billion and 

2 million  respectively 



capital markets 

a key component of our capital markets activities is the underwriting and distribution of corporate credit facilities to partially finance mergers and acquisitions transactions for our clients we have a rigorous risk management process around these activities including a limit structure capping our underwriting risk our potential loss and sublimits for specific asset classes further the ability to approve underwriting exposure is delegated only to senior level individuals in the credit risk management and capital markets organizations with each transaction adjudicated in the loan underwriting approval committee 

mortgage servicing rights 

we have market risk associated with the value of residential msrs which are impacted by various types of inherent risks including risks related to duration basis convexity volatility and yield curve through december 31 2019 we had elected to account for the msrs acquired from famc at fair value while maintaining a lower of cost or market approach on our msrs held before the famc acquisition on january 1 2020 we elected to change our accounting treatment such that all msrs will be accounted for at fair value 

as part of our overall risk management strategy relative to the fair market value of the msrs we enter into various freestanding derivatives such as interest rate swaps interest rate swaptions interest rate futures and forward contracts to purchase mortgagebacked securities to economically hedge the changes in fair value as of december 31 2019 and 2018 the fair value of the famc msrs was 642 million and 600 million  respectively and the total notional amount of related derivative contracts was 86 billion and 46 billion  respectively gains and losses on msrs and the related derivatives used for hedging are included in mortgage banking fees on the consolidated statements of operations 

as of december 31 2019 and 2018  our msrs held before the famc acquisition had a book value of 182 million and 221 million  respectively and were carried at the lower of cost or market as of december 31 2019 and 2018  these msrs had a fair value of 193 million and 243 million  respectively which exceeded the carrying value at those dates 

as with our traded market riskbased activities earnings at risk excludes the impact of msrs msrs are captured under our single price risk management framework that is used for calculating a management value at risk that is consistent with the definition used by banking regulators as defined below 

trading risk 

we are exposed to market risk primarily through client facilitation activities including derivatives and foreign exchange products as well as underwriting and market making activities exposure is created as a result of changes in interest rates and related basis spreads and volatility foreign exchange rates and credit spreads on a select range of interest rates foreign exchange commodities corporate bonds and secondary loan instruments these trading activities are conducted through cbna and ccmi 

client facilitation activities consist primarily of interest rate derivatives financially settled commodity derivatives and foreign exchange contracts where we enter into offsetting trades with a separate counterparty or exchange to manage our market risk exposure in addition to the aforementioned activities we operate a secondary loan trading desk with the objective to meet secondary liquidity needs of our issuing clients’ transactions and investor clients we do not engage in any trading activities with the intent to benefit from shortterm price differences 

we record these rate derivatives and foreign exchange contracts as derivative assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets trading assets and liabilities are carried at fair value with income earned related to these activities included in net interest income changes in fair value of trading assets and liabilities are reflected in other income a component of noninterest income on the consolidated statements of operations 

market risk governance 

the market risk limit setting process is established inline with the formal enterprise risk appetite process and policy this appetite reflects the strategic and enterprise level articulation of opportunities for creating franchise value set to the boundaries of how much market risk to assume dealing authorities represent the key control tool in the management of market risk that allows the cascading of the risk appetite throughout the enterprise a dealing authority sets the operational scope and tolerances within which a business andor trading desk is permitted to operate which is reviewed at least annually dealing authorities are structured to accommodate client facing trades and hedges needed to manage the risk profile primary responsibility for keeping within established tolerances 



resides with the business key risk indicators including var open foreign currency positions and single name risk are monitored on a daily basis and reported against tolerances consistent with our risk appetite and business strategy to relevant business line management and risk counterparts 

market risk measurement 

we use var as a statistical measure for estimating potential exposure of our traded market risk in normal market conditions our var framework for risk management and regulatory reporting is the same risk management var is based on a one day holding period to a 99 confidence level whereas regulatory var is based on a ten day holding period to the same confidence level in addition to var nonstatistical measurements for measuring risk are employed such as sensitivity analysis market value and stress testing 

our market risk platform and associated market risk and valuation models capture correlation effects across all our “covered positions” and allow for aggregation of market risk across products risk types business lines and legal entities we measure monitor and report market risk for both management and regulatory capital purposes 

var overview 

the market risk measurement model is based on historical simulation the var measure estimates the extent of any fair value losses on trading positions that may occur due to broad market movements general var such as changes in the level of interest rates foreign exchange rates equity prices and commodity prices it is calculated on the basis that current positions remain broadly unaltered over the course of a given holding period it is assumed that markets are sufficiently liquid to allow the business to close its positions if required within this holding period var’s benefit is that it captures the historic correlations of a portfolio based on the composition of our “covered positions” we also use a standardized addon approach for the loan trading desk’s specific risk capital which estimates the extent of any losses that may occur from factors other than broad market movements the general var approach is expressed in terms of a confidence level over the past 500 trading days the internal var measure used as the basis of the main var trading limits is a 99 confidence level with a one day holding period meaning that a loss greater than the var is expected to occur on average on only one day in 100 trading days ie 1 of the time theoretically there should be a loss event greater than var two to three times per year the regulatory measure of var is done at a 99 confidence level with a tenday holding period the historical market data applied to calculate the var is updated on a two business day lag refer to “market risk regulatory capital” below for details of our tenday var metrics for the quarters ended december 31 2019 and 2018  respectively including high low average and period end var for interest rate and foreign exchange rate risks as well as total var 



market risk regulatory capital 

the us banking regulators’ “market risk rule” covers the calculation of market risk capital for the purposes of the market risk rule all of our client facing trades and associated hedges maintain a net low risk and do qualify as “covered positions” for the three months ended december 31 2019 we were subject to the reporting threshold under the market risk rule which resulted in the inclusion of 695 million of calculated riskweighted assets however for the three months ended december 31 2018  we were not subject to the reporting threshold as a result 785 million of calculated market riskweighted assets as of december 31 2018 was not included in our riskweighted assets and our covered trading activities were riskweighted under us basel iii standardized credit risk rules the internal management var measure is calculated based on the same population of trades that is utilized for regulatory var the following table presents the results of our modeled and nonmodeled measures for regulatory capital calculations 



 1 for the three months ended december 31 2018 we did not meet the reporting threshold prescribed by market risk rule 

stressed var 

svar is an extension of var but uses a longer historical lookback horizon that is fixed from january 3 2005 this is done not only to identify headline risks from more volatile periods but also to provide a counterbalance to var which may be low during periods of low volatility the holding period for profit and loss determination is ten days in addition to risk management purposes svar is also a component of market risk regulatory capital we calculate svar daily under its own dynamic window regime in a dynamic window regime values of the tenday 99 var are calculated over all possible 260day periods that can be obtained from the complete historical data set refer to “market risk regulatory capital” above for details of svar metrics including high low average and period end svar for the combined portfolio 

sensitivity analysis 

sensitivity analysis is the measure of exposure to a single risk factor such as a one basis point change in rates or credit spread we conduct and monitor sensitivity on interest rates basis spreads foreign exchange exposures option prices and credit spreads whereas var is based on previous moves in market risk factors over recent periods it may not be an accurate predictor of future market moves sensitivity analysis complements var as it provides an indication of risk relative to each factor irrespective of historical market moves and is an effective tool in evaluating the appropriateness of hedging strategies and concentrations 



stress testing 

conducting a stress test of a portfolio consists of running risk models with the inclusion of key variables that simulate various historical or hypothetical scenarios for historical stress tests profit and loss results are simulated for selected time periods corresponding to the most volatile underlying returns while hypothetical stress tests aim to consider concentration risk illiquidity under stressed market conditions and risk arising from our trading activities that may not be fully captured by our other models hypothetical scenarios also assume that market moves happen simultaneously and no repositioning or hedging activity takes place to mitigate losses as market events unfold we generate stress tests of our trading positions on a daily basis for example we currently include a stress test that simulates a “lehmantype” crisis scenario by taking the worst 20trading day peak to trough moves for the various risk factors that go into var from that period and assumes they occurred simultaneously 

var model review and validation 

market risk measurement models used are independently reviewed and subject to ongoing performance analysis by the model owners the independent review and validation focuses on the model methodology market data and performance independent review of market risk measurement models is the responsibility of citizens’ model risk management and validation team aspects covered include challenging the assumptions used the quantitative techniques employed and the theoretical justification underpinning them and an assessment of the soundness of the required data over time where possible the quantitative impact of the major underlying modeling assumptions will be estimated eg through developing alternative models results of such reviews are shared with our us banking regulators the market risk models may be periodically enhanced due to changes in market price levels and price action regime behavior the market risk management and validation team will conduct internal validation before a new or changed model element is implemented and before a change is made to a market data mapping 

var backtesting 

backtesting is one form of validation of the var model and is run daily the market risk rule requires a comparison of our internal var measure to the actual net trading revenue excluding fees commissions reserves intraday trading and net interest income for each day over the preceding year the most recent 250 business days any observed loss in excess of the var number is taken as an exception the level of exceptions determines the multiplication factor used to derive the var and svarbased capital requirement for regulatory reporting purposes when applicable we perform subportfolio backtesting as required under the market risk rule using models approved by our banking regulators for interest rate credit spread and foreign exchange positions 

the following graph shows our daily net trading revenue and total internal modeled var for the year ended december 31 2019

competition 

the financial services industry is highly competitive our branch footprint is in the new england midatlantic and midwest regions though certain lines of business serve national markets within these markets we face competition from community banks superregional and national financial institutions credit unions savings and loan associations mortgage banking firms consumer finance companies securities brokerage firms insurance companies money market funds hedge funds and private equity firms some of our larger competitors may make available to their customers a broader array of product pricing and structure alternatives while some smaller competitors may have more liberal lending policies and processes competition among providers of financial products and services continues to increase with consumers having the opportunity to select from a growing variety of traditional and nontraditional alternatives the ability of nonbanking financial institutions including fintech companies to provide services previously limited to commercial banks has also intensified competition 

in consumer banking the industry has become increasingly dependent on and oriented toward technologydriven delivery systems permitting transactions to be conducted through telephone online and mobile channels in addition technology has lowered barriers to entry and made it possible for nonbank institutions to attract funds and provide lending and other financial services in our footprint despite not having a physical presence there the emergence of digitalonly banking models has increased and we expect this trend to continue given their lower cost structure these institutions are often able to offer on average higher rates on deposit products than retail banking institutions with a traditional branch footprint the primary factors driving competition for loans and deposits are interest rates fees charged tailored value propositions to different customer segments customer service levels convenience including branch location and hours of operation and the range of products and services offered 

in commercial banking there is intense competition for quality loan originations from traditional banking institutions particularly large regional banks as well as commercial finance companies leasing companies and other nonbank lenders and institutional investors including clo managers hedge funds and private equity firms some larger competitors including certain national banks that compete in our market area may offer a broader array of products and due to their asset size may sometimes be in a position to hold more exposure on their own balance sheet we compete on a number of factors including providing innovative corporate finance solutions quality of customer service and execution range of products offered price and reputation 

regulation and supervision 

our operations are subject to extensive regulation supervision and examination under federal and state laws these laws and regulations cover all aspects of our business including lending practices safeguarding deposits customer privacy and information security capital structure liquidity conduct and qualifications of personnel and certain transactions with affiliates these laws and regulations are intended primarily for the protection of depositors

the deposit insurance fund and the banking system as a whole and not for the protection of shareholders or other investors the discussion below outlines the material elements of selected laws and regulations applicable to us and our subsidiaries changes in applicable law or regulation and in their interpretation and application by regulatory agencies and other governmental authorities cannot be predicted but may have a material effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

we and our subsidiaries and affiliates are subject to numerous examinations by federal and state banking regulators as well as the sec finra and various state insurance and securities regulators in some cases regulatory agencies may take supervisory actions that may not be publicly disclosed and such actions may restrict or limit our activities or activities of our subsidiaries as part of our regular examination process our and cbna’s respective regulators may advise us or cbna to operate under various restrictions as a prudential matter we and cbna have periodically received requests for information from regulatory authorities at the federal and state level including from state insurance commissions state attorneys general federal agencies or law enforcement authorities securities regulators and other regulatory authorities concerning their business practices such requests are considered incidental to the normal conduct of business for a further discussion of how regulatory actions may impact our business see “risk factors” in part i item 1a included in this report for additional information regarding regulatory and supervisory matters see note 18 “commitments and contingencies” in the notes to our consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this report 

overview 

we are a bank holding company under the bank holding company act of 1956 “bank holding company act” we have elected to be treated as a financial holding company under amendments to the bank holding company act as effected by grammleachbliley act of 1999 “glba” as such we are subject to the supervision examination and reporting requirements of the bank holding company act and the regulations of the frb including through the federal reserve bank of boston under the system of “functional regulation” established under the bank holding company act the frb serves as the primary regulator of our consolidated organization and the sec serves as the primary regulator of our brokerdealer subsidiaries and directly regulates the activities of those subsidiaries with the frb exercising a supervisory role the doddfrank act amendments to the bank holding company act require the frb to examine the activities of nondepository institution subsidiaries of bank holding companies that are not functionally regulated that are engaged in depository institutionpermissible activities and provide the frb with backup examination and enforcement authority for such activities the frb also has the authority to require reports of and examine any subsidiary of a bank holding company 

on july 3 2018 we received regulatory approval from the occ to consolidate our two banking subsidiaries via a merger of cbpa into cbna we completed this consolidation on january 2 2019 such that cbna is now our sole banking subsidiary cbna is a national banking association as such it is subject to regulation examination and supervision by the occ as its primary federal regulator and by the fdic as the insurer of its deposits 

the federal banking regulators have authority to approve or disapprove mergers acquisitions consolidations the establishment of branches and similar corporate actions these banking regulators also have the power to prevent the continuance or development of unsafe or unsound banking practices or other violations of law federal law governs the activities in which cbna engages including the investments it makes and the aggregate amount of loans that it may grant to one borrower various consumer and compliance laws and regulations also affect its operations the actions the frb takes to implement monetary policy also affect cbna 

in addition cbna is subject to regulation supervision and examination by the cfpb with respect to consumer protection laws and regulations the cfpb has broad authority to among other things regulate the offering and provision of consumer financial products by depository institutions such as cbna with more than 10 billion in total assets the cfpb may promulgate rules under a variety of consumer financial protection statutes including the truth in lending act the electronic funds transfer act and the real estate settlement procedures act 

financial regulatory reform 

the doddfrank act regulates many aspects of the financial services industry and addresses among other things systemic risk capital adequacy deposit insurance assessments consumer financial protection derivatives and securities markets restrictions on an insured bank’s transactions with its affiliates lending limits and mortgagelending practices moreover as a general matter in recent years the federal banking regulators the frb the occ and the fdic as well as the cfpb have taken a more stringent approach to supervising and regulating the financial institutions and financial products and services over which the regulators exercise their respective supervisory authorities including with respect to enforcement matters cbna’s and our products and services have been subject 

citizens financial group inc 

business 

to greater supervisory scrutiny and enhanced supervisory requirements and expectations in recent years and we expect this scrutiny to continue for the foreseeable future 

prior to amendment by the economic growth regulatory relief and consumer protection act of 2018 “egrrcpa” which was signed into law on may 24 2018 section 165 of the doddfrank act directed the frb to establish enhanced prudential standards applicable to systemically important financial institutions “sifis” bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of 50 billion or more the frb has adopted final rules implementing three aspects of section 165 liquidity requirements stress testing of capital and overall risk management requirements the current rules’ liquidity requirements are described below under “—liquidity requirements” and their stress testing requirements are described below under “—capital planning and stress testing requirements” in addition the resolution planning requirements implemented by the frb and fdic are described below under “—resolution planning” 

egrrcpa amended the doddfrank act by increasing the asset threshold for application of these enhanced prudential standards from 50 billion to 250 billion egrrcpa’s increased asset threshold took effect immediately for bank holding companies with total consolidated assets less than 100 billion the increased asset threshold generally will become effective 18 months after the date of enactment that is in november 2019 for bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of 100 billion or more but less than 250 billion including citizens the frb is authorized however during the 18month period to exempt by order any bank holding company with assets between 100 billion and 250 billion from any enhanced prudential standard requirement the frb is also authorized to apply any enhanced prudential standard requirement to any bank holding company with between 100 billion and 250 billion in total consolidated assets that would otherwise be exempt under egrrcpa if the frb determines that such action is appropriate to address risks to financial stability and promote safety and soundness taking into consideration certain factors including the bank holding company’s capital structure riskiness complexity financial activities including financial activities of subsidiaries size and any other riskrelated factors that the frb deems appropriate us global systemically important bank holding companies “gsibs” and bank holding companies with 250 billion or more in total consolidated assets remain fully subject to the doddfrank act’s enhanced prudential standards requirements 

in october 2018 the frb and the other federal banking regulators proposed rules that would tailor the application of the enhanced prudential standards to bank holding companies and depository institutions to implement the egrrcpa amendments “tailoring nprs” the proposed rules would assign each us bank holding company with 100 billion or more in total consolidated assets as well as its bank subsidiaries to one of four categories based on its size and five riskbased indicators i crossjurisdictional activity ii weighted shortterm wholesale funding iii nonbank assets iv offbalance sheet exposure and v status as a us gsib under the tailoring nprs “category iv standards” would apply to banking organizations with at least 100 billion in total consolidated assets that do not meet any of the thresholds specified for categories i through iii category i standards would be applicable to us gsibs category ii standards would be applicable to nongsibs with 700 billion or more in total consolidated assets or at least 100 billion in total consolidated assets and 75 billion or more in crossjurisdictional activity and category iii standards would be applicable to banking organizations that are not subject to category i or category ii standards and that have at least 250 billion in total consolidated assets or at least 100 billion in total consolidated assets and 75 billion or more in any of three indicators i nonbank assets ii weighted shortterm wholesale funding or iii offbalance sheet exposures 

in connection with the release of the proposed rules frb staff indicated which firms would fall into each of the four categories based on data for the second quarter of 2018 according to the frb staff’s projections citizens would be a “category iv” firm under the proposed rules firms subject to category iv standards would generally be subject to the same capital and liquidity requirements as firms with under 100 billion in total consolidated assets but would also be required to monitor and report certain riskbased indicators accordingly under the tailoring nprs category iv firms would i no longer be subject to any lcr or proposed nsfr requirement ii remain not subject to advanced approaches capital requirements iii remain eligible to optout of the requirement to recognize most elements of accumulated other comprehensive income in regulatory capital iv remain not subject to the supplementary leverage ratio v remain not subject to the countercyclical capital buffer vi no longer be subject to companyrun stress testing requirements and vii become subject to supervisory stress testing on a biennial instead of annual basis we discuss other elements of the proposed rules where relevant below the tailoring nprs are subject to modification through the federal rulemaking process in accordance with the administrative procedures act 

the us basel iii rules summarized briefly in the “—capital” section below have impacted our level of capital and may influence the types of business we may pursue and how we pursue business opportunities among other things the us basel iii rules raised the required minimums for certain capital ratios added a common equity

ratio included capital buffers and restricted what constitutes capital the capital and risk weighting requirements became effective for us on january 1 2015 

many of the provisions of the doddfrank act egrrcpa and other laws are subject to further rulemaking guidance and interpretation by the applicable federal regulators the ultimate effects of egrrcpa and the tailoring nprs on citizens cbna and their respective subsidiaries and activities will be subject to the final form of the tailoring nprs and additional rulemakings issued by the frb and other federal regulators we will continue to evaluate the impact of any changes in law and any new regulations promulgated including changes in regulatory costs and fees modifications to consumer products or disclosures required by the cfpb and the requirements of the enhanced supervision provisions among others 

financial holding company regulation 

the bank holding company act generally restricts bank holding companies from engaging in business activities other than i banking managing or controlling banks ii furnishing services to or performing services for subsidiaries and iii activities that the frb has determined to be so closely related to banking as to be a proper incident thereto for so long as they continue to meet the eligibility requirements for financial holding company status financial holding companies may engage in a broader range of activities including among other things securities underwriting and dealing insurance underwriting and brokerage merchant banking and other activities that are determined by the frb in coordination with the treasury department to be “financial in nature or incidental thereto” or that the frb determines unilaterally to be “complementary” to financial activities in addition a financial holding company may conduct permissible new financial activities or acquire permissible nonbank financial companies with afterthefact notice to the frb 

as noted above we currently have elected to be treated as a financial holding company under amendments to the bank holding company act as effected by glba to maintain financial holding company status a financial holding company and all of its insured depository institution subsidiaries must remain well capitalized and well managed as described below under “federal deposit insurance act” and maintain a cra rating of at least “satisfactory” if a financial holding company ceases to meet the capital and management requirements the frb’s regulations provide that the financial holding company must enter into an agreement with the frb to comply with all applicable capital and management requirements until the financial holding company returns to compliance the frb may impose limitations or conditions on the conduct of its activities and the company may not commence any of the broader financial activities permissible for financial holding companies or acquire a company engaged in such financial activities without prior approval of the frb in addition the failure to meet such requirements could result in other material restrictions on the activities of the financial holding company may also adversely affect the financial holding company’s ability to enter into certain transactions including acquisition transactions or obtain necessary approvals in connection therewith and may result in the bank holding company losing financial holding company status any restrictions imposed on our activities by the frb may not necessarily be made known to the public if the company does not return to compliance within 180 days which period may be extended the frb may require the financial holding company to divest its subsidiary depository institutions or to discontinue or divest investments in companies engaged in activities permissible only for a bank holding company electing to be treated as a financial holding company if any insured depository institution subsidiary of a financial holding company fails to maintain a cra rating of at least “satisfactory” the financial holding company would be subject to restrictions on certain new activities and acquisitions bank holding companies and banks must also be both well capitalized and well managed in order to acquire banks located outside their home state 

capital 

we must comply with the frb’s capital adequacy rules and cbna must comply with similar capital adequacy rules of the occ the capital adequacy rules of both agencies are based on the basel iii framework for more detail on our regulatory capital see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — capital and regulatory matters” in part ii item 7 included in this report 

the us basel iii rules among other things i impose a capital measure called common equity tier 1 capital or “cet1 capital” ii specify that tier 1 capital consists of cet1 capital and “additional tier 1 capital” instruments meeting certain revised requirements iii define cet1 capital narrowly by requiring that most deductionsadjustments to regulatory capital measures be made to cet1 and not to the other components of capital and iv expand the scope of the deductionsadjustments to capital as compared to previous regulations under the us basel iii rules the minimum capital ratios are 

citizens financial group inc 

business 

• 45 cet1 capital to riskweighted assets 

• 60 tier 1 capital that is cet1 capital plus additional tier 1 capital to riskweighted assets 

• 80 total capital that is tier 1 capital plus tier 2 capital to riskweighted assets and 

• 40 tier 1 capital to total average consolidated assets as defined under us basel iii standardized 

           approach known as the “leverage ratio” 

the us basel iii rules also impose a capital conservation buffer “ccb” on top of the three minimum riskweighted asset ratios listed above the implementation of the ccb began on january 1 2016 at 0625 and increased by 0625 annually over a three year phasein period which ended january 1 2019 the ccb for 2018 was 1875 and increased to its fully phasedin level of 25 as of january 1 2019 banking institutions that fail to meet the effective minimum ratios once the fully phasedin ccb is taken into account that is 70 for cet1 capital to riskweighted assets 85 for tier 1 capital to riskweighted assets and 105 for total capital to riskweighted assets will be subject to constraints on capital distributions including dividends and share repurchases and certain discretionary executive compensation the severity of the constraints depends on the amount of the shortfall and the institution’s “eligible retained income” that is four quarter trailing net income net of distributions and tax effects not reflected in net income for more details see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — capital and regulatory matters” in part ii item 7 included in this report on april 10 2018 the frb issued a proposal designed to create a single integrated capital requirement by combining the quantitative assessment of firms’ capital plans with the ccb requirement details of this proposal are discussed under “—capital planning and stress testing requirements” below although the proposal if adopted would change the way in which the minimum capital ratios are calculated firms would continue to be subject to progressively more stringent constraints on capital actions as they approach the minimum ratios 

we are also subject to the frbs riskbased capital requirements for market risk see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — market risk — market risk regulatory capital” in part ii item 7 included in this report for further discussion 

the us basel iii rules also provide for a number of deductions from and adjustments to cet1 capital for example certain deferred tax assets “dtas” mortgage servicing assets and significant investments in nonconsolidated financial entities must be deducted from cet1 capital to the extent that any one such category exceeds 10 of cet1 capital or all such items in the aggregate exceed 15 of cet1 capital the deductions and other adjustments to cet1 capital generally became fully phasedin on january 1 2018 although as discussed below the federal banking regulators have extended the transitional treatment for certain items 

in november 2017 the federal banking regulators issued a final rule that extended the 2017 transition provisions for certain us basel iii capital rules for nonadvanced approaches banking organizations including us effective january 1 2018 the final rule retains the 2017 us basel iii transitional treatment of certain dtas mortgage servicing assets investments in unconsolidated financial institutions and minority interests as a result since january 1 2018 our mortgage servicing assets have retained their 2017 risk weight treatment which will continue until the federal banking regulators revise the extended transitional treatment under the november 2017 final rule which may occur in connection with the finalization of the related september 2017 proposal to simplify the capital treatment of certain dtas mortgage servicing assets significant investments in unconsolidated financial institutions and minority interests 

the us basel iii rules prescribe a standardized approach for risk weighting many categories of assets these categories generally range from 0 for us government and agency securities to 600 for certain equity exposures to 1250 for certain securitization exposures 

with respect to cbna the us basel iii rules also revise the “prompt corrective action” regulations pursuant to section 38 of the federal deposit insurance act as discussed below in “federal deposit insurance act” 

in december 2017 the basel committee published standards that it described as the finalization of the basel iii postcrisis regulatory reforms the standards are commonly referred to as “basel iv” among other things these standards revise the basel committee’s standardized approach for credit risk including recalibrating risk weights and introducing new capital requirements for certain “unconditionally cancellable commitments” such as unused credit card and home equity lines of credit and provide a new standardized approach for operational risk capital under the basel framework these standards will generally be effective on january 1 2022 with an aggregate output floor phasing in through january 1 2027 under the current us basel iii rules operational risk capital requirements and a capital floor apply only to advanced approaches institutions and not to cfg or cbna the impact of basel iv on cfg and cbna will depend on the manner in which it is implemented by the frb and the occ

liquidity requirements 

we are currently subject to the basel iiibased us lcr rule which is a quantitative liquidity metric designed to ensure that a covered bank or bank holding company maintains an adequate level of unencumbered highquality liquid assets to cover expected net cash outflows over a 30day time horizon under an acute liquidity stress scenario however as noted above under the tailoring nprs category iv firms including citizens would no longer be subject to any lcr requirement the lcr rule currently applies in its most comprehensive form only to advanced approaches bank holding companies that is those with 250 billion or more in total consolidated assets or 10 billion or more in onbalance sheet foreign exposures and depository institution subsidiaries of such bank holding companies with 10 billion or more in total consolidated assets the lcr rule following the threshold amendments under egrrcpa currently applies in a modified form to bank holding companies such as the parent company that have 100 billion or more but less than 250 billion in total consolidated assets and less than 10 billion in total onbalance sheet foreign exposure the us version of the lcr differs in certain respects from the basel committee’s version the us version includes a narrower definition of highquality liquid assets different prescribed cash inflow and outflow assumptions for certain types of instruments and transactions and a shorter phasein schedule that began on january 1 2015 and is now complete the modified lcr currently requires us to maintain a ratio of highquality liquid assets to net cash outflows of 70 compared to 100 in the comprehensive lcr applicable to advanced approaches bank holding companies at december 31 2018 our lcr on the modified basis was above the minimum requirement 

until the changes to the lcr requirement contained in the tailoring nprs are adopted as a modified lcr company we are required to calculate our lcr on a monthly basis if a covered company fails to meet the minimum required lcr it must promptly notify its primary federal banking regulator and may be required to take remedial actions in december 2016 the frb issued a final rule that requires bank holding companies currently subject to the lcr rule to disclose publicly on a quarterly basis quantitative and qualitative information about certain components of their lcr for modified lcr bank holding companies this disclosure requirement began with the fourth quarter of 2018 and is required to be disclosed by march 1 2019 we will publish the required information on quantitative and qualitative components of our lcr on our regulatory filings and disclosures page on our investor relations website at httpinvestorcitizensbankcom 

the basel iii framework also includes a second liquidity standard the nsfr which is designed to promote more medium and longterm funding of the assets and activities of banks over a oneyear time horizon in may 2016 the federal banking regulators issued a proposed rule that would implement the nsfr for large us banking organizations including citizens however as noted above under the tailoring nprs category iv firms including citizens would not be subject to any nsfr requirement under the 2016 proposal the most stringent requirements would apply to advanced approaches bank holding companies and would have required such organizations to maintain a minimum nsfr of 10 on an ongoing basis calculated by dividing the organization’s available stable funding “asf” by its required stable funding “rsf” bank holding companies with 50 billion or more in total consolidated assets but that are not advanced approaches bank holding companies including citizens would have been subject to a modified nsfr requirement which would have required such bank holding companies to maintain a minimum nsfr of 07 on an ongoing basis under the 2016 proposal a banking organization’s asf would have been calculated by applying specified standard weightings to its equity and liabilities based on their expected stability over a oneyear time horizon and its rsf would be calculated by applying specified standardized weightings to its assets derivative exposures and commitments based on their liquidity characteristics over the same oneyear time horizon 

finally per the liquidity rules included in the frb’s enhanced prudential standards adopted pursuant to section 165 of the doddfrank act referred to above under “—financial regulatory reform” we are also required to maintain a buffer of highly liquid assets based on projected funding needs for 30 days the liquidity buffer is in addition to the federal banking regulators’ lcr rule and is described by the frb as being “complementary” to the lcr under the tailoring nprs the liquidity buffer requirements for category iv firms such as citizens would not change and category iv firms would remain subject to liquidity risk management requirements however these requirements would be tailored such that these firms would be required to i calculate collateral positions monthly as opposed to weekly as is currently required ii establish a more limited set of liquidity risk limits than are currently required and iii monitor fewer elements of intraday liquidity risk exposures than are currently monitored category iv firms would also be subject to liquidity stress testing quarterly rather than monthly and would be required to report liquidity data on a monthly basis 

  capital planning and stress testing requirements 

under the ccar process bank holding companies with 100 billion or more in total consolidated assets are required to develop and maintain a capital plan and to submit the plan to the frb for review ccar is designed to 

citizens financial group inc 

business 

evaluate a bank holding company’s capital adequacy capital adequacy process and planned capital distributions such as dividend payments and common stock repurchases as part of ccar the frb evaluates whether a bank holding company has sufficient capital to continue operations under various hypothetical scenarios of economic and financial market stress these scenarios currently include both bank holding company and frbdeveloped scenarios including an “adverse” and a “severely adverse” stress scenario although the frb on january 8 2019 proposed amendments that among other things would eliminate the adverse scenario the frb also evaluates whether the bank holding company has robust forwardlooking capital planning processes that accounts for the bank holding company’s unique risks 

due to the importance and intensity of the stress tests and the ccar process we have dedicated significant resources to comply with stress testing and capital planning requirements and may continue to do so in the future 

currently any capital plan submitted to the frb must cover a “planning horizon” of at least nine quarters beginning with the quarter preceding the submission of the plan for example january 1 2020 for the capital plans required to be filed on or before april 5 2020 bank holding companies are also subject to an ongoing requirement to revise and resubmit their capital plans upon the occurrence of certain events specified by rule or when required by the frb the frb determines whether to object to a company’s capital plan based on whether the plan passes quantitative tests requiring that the company demonstrate that it will continue to meet all minimum capital requirements applicable to it over the ninequarter planning horizon under all applicable scenarios the frb also incorporates an assessment of the qualitative aspects of the firm’s capital planning process into regular ongoing supervisory activities and through targeted horizontal assessments of particular aspects of capital planning 

the frb’s capital planning and stress testing rules generally make our ability to make quarterly capital distributions in the form of dividends and share repurchases contingent on the frb’s nonobjection to our capital plan and limit our ability to make quarterly capital distributions if the amount of our actual cumulative quarterly capital issuances of instruments that qualify as regulatory capital are less than we indicated in our submitted capital plan for which we received a nonobjection from the frb 

should the frb object to a capital plan a bank holding company may not make any capital distribution other than those capital distributions to which the frb has indicated its nonobjection in writing participating firms are currently required to submit their capital plans and stress testing results to the frb on or before april 5th of each year in which they are participating and the frb will publish the results of its supervisory ccar review of submitted capital plans by june 30th of each year in addition the frb will separately publish the results of its supervisory stress test under both the supervisory severely adverse and adverse scenarios the information to be released will include among other things the frb’s projection of companyspecific information including poststress capital ratios and the minimum value of these ratios over the planning horizon 

 on february 5 2019 the frb announced that certain lesscomplex bhcs with less than 250 billion in assets including citizens would not be required to be subject to supervisory stress testing companyrun stress testing or the ccar quantitative assessment for the 2019 cycle although firms could elect to submit a capital plan for the 2019 cycle the frb has also announced that unless citizens elects to submit a capital plan for the 2019 cycle for the period from july 1 2019 through june 30 2020 citizens may make capital distributions up to the amount that would have allowed citizens to remain above all minimum capital requirements in ccar 2018 adjusted for any changes in citizens’ regulatory capital ratios since the frb acted on citizens’ 2018 capital plan we remain subject to the requirement to develop and maintain an annual capital plan that is reviewed and approved by our board of directors or one of its committees and we must submit our planned capital actions for the period between july 1 2019 through june 30 2020 to the frb by april 5 2019 

additionally under the tailoring nprs category iv firms such as citizens would no longer be subject to companyrun stress testing requirements ie the requirement to stress test using bank holding companydeveloped and supervisory scenarios but would remain subject to the quantitative review of their capital plans under ccar which the frb noted that it plans to propose to conduct on a biennial instead of annual basis in connection with the release of the tailoring nprs the frb noted that it expects to revise its guidance relating to capital planning to align with the proposed categories of standards set forth in the tailoring nprs and the impact of the future proposal on citizens and its capital planning process will depend on the final form of the frb’s revised guidance 

lastly and as noted above the frb’s april 10 2018 proposal to create a single integrated capital requirement by combining the quantitative assessment of ccar with the ccb requirement would if adopted replace the current static 25 ccb with a stress capital buffer “scb” requirement the scb subject to a minimum of 25 would reflect stressed losses in the supervisory severely adverse scenario of the frb’s supervisory stress tests and would also include four quarters of planned common stock dividends the proposal would also introduce a stress leverage buffer “slb” requirement similar to the scb which would apply to the tier 1 leverage ratio in addition the 

citizens financial group inc 

business 

proposal would eliminate the quantitative objection provisions of ccar but would require a bank holding company to reduce its planned capital distributions if those distributions would not be consistent with the applicable capital buffer constraints based on the bank holding company’s own baseline scenario projections the frb has stated that it intends to propose revisions to the stress buffer requirements that would be applicable to category iv bank holding companies to align with the proposed twoyear supervisory stress testing cycle for category iv bank holding companies as is currently the case under the proposal a bank holding company subject to ccar would generally not be permitted to exceed the capital distributions reflected in its capital plan either on a gross basis or net of capital issuances without prior approval of the frb 

resolution planning 

under section 165 of the doddfrank act as amended by egrrcpa a bank holding company with total consolidated assets of 100 billion or more such as citizens must currently submit a periodic resolution plan to the frb and fdic providing for the company’s strategy for rapid and orderly resolution in the event of its material financial distress or failure we are required to submit our most recent resolution plan to the frb and fdic by december 31 2019 if the frb and the fdic jointly determine that our plan is not credible or would not facilitate an orderly resolution under the us bankruptcy code and we do not cure the deficiencies the frb and the fdic may jointly impose more stringent capital leverage or liquidity requirements or restrictions on our growth activities or operations in connection with the release of the tailoring nprs the frb noted that it expects to release a proposal to amend with the fdic their joint resolution plan rule to address the applicability of resolution plan requirements for us bank holding companies with between 100 billion and 250 billion in total consolidated assets including citizens and to adjust the scope and applicability of resolution plan requirements for firms that remain subject to them 

the fdic has separately implemented a resolution planning rule that currently requires insured depository institutions of 50 billion or more in total assets such as cbna to periodically submit a resolution plan cbna submitted its most recent resolution plan to the fdic in july 2018 

standards for safety and soundness 

the fdia requires the frb occ and fdic to prescribe operational and managerial standards for all insured depository institutions including cbna the agencies have adopted regulations and interagency guidelines which set forth the safety and soundness standards used to identify and address problems at insured depository institutions before capital becomes impaired if an agency determines that a bank fails to satisfy any standard it may require the bank to submit an acceptable plan to achieve compliance consistent with deadlines for the submission and review of such safety and soundness compliance plans if after being notified to submit a compliance plan an institution fails to submit an acceptable compliance plan or fails in any material respect to implement an acceptable compliance plan the agency must issue an order directing action to correct the deficiency and may issue an order directing other actions of the types to which an undercapitalized institution is subject under the fdia see “federal deposit insurance act” below if an institution fails to comply with such an order the agency may seek to enforce such order in judicial proceedings and to impose civil money penalties 

federal deposit insurance act 

the fdia requires among other things that the federal banking regulators take “prompt corrective action” with respect to depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements as described above in “capital” the fdia sets forth the following five capital categories “wellcapitalized” “adequately capitalized” “undercapitalized” “significantly undercapitalized” and “critically undercapitalized” a depository institution’s capital category depends upon how its capital levels compare with various relevant capital measures and certain other factors that are established by regulation the federal banking regulators must take certain mandatory supervisory actions and are authorized to take other discretionary actions with respect to institutions that are undercapitalized significantly undercapitalized or critically undercapitalized with the actions becoming more restrictive and punitive the lower the institution’s capital category under existing rules an institution that is not an advanced approaches institution is deemed to be “well capitalized” if it has i a cet1 ratio of at least 65 ii a tier 1 capital ratio of at least 8 iii a total capital ratio of at least 10 and iv a tier 1 leverage ratio of at least 5 

the fdia’s prompt corrective action provisions only apply to depository institutions and not to bank holding companies the frb’s regulations applicable to bank holding companies separately define “well capitalized” for bank holding companies to require maintaining a tier 1 capital ratio of at least 6 and a total capital ratio of at least 10 as described above under “—financial holding company regulation” a financial holding company that is not wellcapitalized and wellmanaged or whose bank subsidiaries are not well capitalized and well managed under 

citizens financial group inc 

business 

applicable prompt corrective action standards may be restricted in certain of its activities and ultimately may lose financial holding company status as of december 31 2018 the parent company and cbna were wellcapitalized 

the fdia prohibits insured banks from accepting brokered deposits or offering interest rates on any deposits significantly higher than the prevailing rate in the bank’s normal market area or nationally depending upon where the deposits are solicited unless it is “wellcapitalized” or it is “adequately capitalized” and receives a waiver from the fdic a bank that is “adequately capitalized” and that accepts brokered deposits under a waiver from the fdic may not pay an interest rate on any deposit in excess of 75 basis points over certain prevailing market rates the fdia imposes no such restrictions on a bank that is “wellcapitalized” 

deposit insurance 

the fdia requires cbna to pay deposit insurance assessments fdic assessment rates for large institutions are calculated based on one of two scorecards one for most large institutions that have more than 10 billion in assets and another for “highly complex” institutions that have over 50 billion in assets and are fully owned by a parent with over 500 billion in assets each scorecard has a performance score and a lossseverity score that are combined to produce a total score which is translated into an initial assessment rate in calculating these scores the fdic utilizes the camels ratings and forwardlooking financial measures to assess an institution’s ability to withstand assetrelated stress and fundingrelated stress the fdic has the ability to make discretionary adjustments to the total score up or down based upon significant risk factors that are not adequately captured in the scorecard the total score is then translated to an initial base assessment rate on a nonlinear sharplyincreasing scale since july 1 2016 for large institutions the initial base assessment rate has ranged from 3 to 30 basis points on an annualized basis after the effect of potential baserate adjustments the total base assessment rate could range from 15 to 40 basis points on an annualized basis 

the deposit insurance assessment is calculated based on average consolidated total assets less average tangible equity of the insured depository institution during the assessment period deposit insurance assessments are also affected by the minimum reserve ratio with respect to the deposit insurance fund “dif” in march 2016 the fdic issued a final rule that imposed on insured depository institutions with at least 10 billion in assets including cbna a surcharge of 45 basis points per annum that continued through september 30 2018 when the reserve ratio of the dif reached 136 exceeding the statutorily required minimum reserve ratio of 135 therefore the surcharge no longer applies 

dividends 

various federal statutory provisions and regulations as well as regulatory expectations limit the amount of dividends that we and our subsidiaries may pay 

our payment of dividends to our stockholders is subject to the oversight of the frb in particular the frb reviews the dividend policies and share repurchases of a large bank holding company based on capital plans submitted as part of the ccar process and on the results of stress tests as discussed above the frb assesses dividend policies and share repurchases against among other things the bank holding company’s ability to achieve the required capital ratios under the basel iiibased us revised capital rules in addition to other limitations our ability to make any capital distributions including dividends and share repurchases is contingent on the frb’s nonobjection to such planned distributions included in our submitted capital plan or the frb’s authorization to make distributions if we are exempt from the requirement to submit a capital plan see “—capital” and “—capital planning and stress testing requirements” above 

dividends payable by cbna as a national bank subsidiary are limited to the lesser of the amount calculated under a “recent earnings” test and an “undivided profits” test under the recent earnings test a dividend may not be paid if the total of all dividends declared by a bank in any calendar year is in excess of the current year’s net income combined with the retained net income of the two preceding years less any required transfers to surplus unless the national bank obtains the approval of the occ under the undivided profits test a dividend may not be paid in excess of the entity’s “undivided profits” generally accumulated net profits that have not been paid out as dividends or transferred to surplus federal bank regulatory agencies have issued policy statements which provide that fdicinsured depository institutions and their holding companies should generally pay dividends only out of their current operating earnings

support of subsidiary bank 

under section 616 of the doddfrank act which codifies the frb’s longstanding “source of strength” doctrine we must serve as a source of financial and managerial strength for our depository institution subsidiary the statute defines “source of financial strength” as the ability to provide financial assistance in the event of the financial distress at the insured depository institution the frb may require that we provide such support at times even when we may not have the financial resources to do so or when doing so may not serve our interests or those of our shareholders or creditors in addition any capital loans by a bank holding company to its subsidiary bank are subordinate in right of payment to deposits and to certain other indebtedness of such subsidiary bank in the event of a bank holding company’s bankruptcy any commitment by the bank holding company to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to a priority of payment 

transactions with affiliates and insiders 

sections 23a and 23b of the federal reserve act and related frb rules including regulation w restrict cbna from extending credit to or engaging in certain other transactions with us and our nonbank subsidiaries these restrictions place limits on certain specified “covered transactions” between bank subsidiaries and their affiliates which must be limited to 10 of a bank’s capital and surplus for any one affiliate and 20 for all affiliates furthermore within the foregoing limitations as to amount certain covered transactions must meet specified collateral requirements ranging from 100 to 130 covered transactions are defined to include among other things a loan or extension of credit as well as a purchase of securities issued by an affiliate a purchase of assets unless otherwise exempted by the frb from the affiliate the acceptance of securities issued by the affiliate as collateral for a loan derivatives transactions and securities lending transactions where the bank has credit exposure to an affiliate and the issuance of a guarantee acceptance or letter of credit on behalf of an affiliate all covered transactions including certain additional transactions such as transactions with a third party in which an affiliate has a financial interest must be conducted on market terms the doddfrank act significantly enhanced and expanded the scope and coverage of these limitations in particular by including within its scope derivative transactions by and between cbna or its subsidiaries and the parent company or its other subsidiaries the frb enforces these restrictions and we are audited for compliance 

section 23b prohibits an institution from engaging in certain transactions with affiliates unless the transactions are on terms substantially the same or at least as favorable to the bank as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with nonaffiliated companies except for limitations on lowquality asset purchases and transactions that are deemed to be unsafe or unsound regulation w generally excludes affiliated depository institutions from treatment as affiliates transactions between a bank and any of its subsidiaries that are engaged in certain financial activities may be subject to the affiliated transaction limits the frb also may designate banking subsidiaries as affiliates 

pursuant to frb regulation o we are also subject to quantitative restrictions on extensions of credit to executive officers directors principal stockholders and their related interests in general such extensions of credit i may not exceed certain dollar limitations ii must be made on substantially the same terms including interest rates and collateral as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with third parties and iii must not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features certain extensions of credit also require the approval of our board 

volcker rule 

the doddfrank act prohibits banks and their affiliates from engaging in proprietary trading and investing in sponsoring and having certain relationships with private funds such as hedge funds or private equity funds that would be an investment company for purposes of the investment company act of 1940 but for the exclusions in sections 3c1 or 3c7 of that act both subject to certain limited exceptions the statutory provision is commonly called the “volcker rule” the regulations implementing the volcker rule jointly issued by the frb occ fdic the sec and the commodity futures trading commission “cftc” require that large bank holding companies design and implement compliance programs to ensure adherence to the volcker rule’s prohibitions maintenance and monitoring of the required compliance program requires the expenditure of resources and management attention in july 2018 the frb occ fdic cftc and sec issued a notice of proposed rulemaking intended to tailor the application of the volcker rule based on the size and scope of a banking entity’s trading activities and to clarify and amend certain definitions requirements and exemptions the ultimate impact of any amendments to the volcker rule will depend on among other things further rulemaking and implementation guidance from the relevant us federal regulatory agencies and the development of market practices and standards

consumer financial protection regulations 

the retail activities of banks are subject to a variety of statutes and regulations designed to protect consumers and promote lending to various sectors of the economy and population these laws include but are not limited to the equal credit opportunity act the fair debt collection practices act the fair credit reporting act the truth in lending act the home mortgage disclosure act the service members civil relief act the expedited funds availability act the right to financial privacy act the truth in savings act the electronic funds transfer act and their respective federal regulations and state law counterparts 

in addition to these federal laws and regulations the guidance and interpretations of the various federal agencies charged with the responsibility of implementing such regulations also influences loan and deposit operations 

the cfpb has broad rulemaking supervisory examination and enforcement authority over various consumer financial protection laws including the laws referenced above fair lending laws and certain other statutes the cfpb also has examination and primary enforcement authority with respect to depository institutions with 10 billion or more in assets including the authority to prevent unfair deceptive or abusive acts or practices in connection with the offering of consumer financial products 

the doddfrank act permits states to adopt stricter consumer protection laws and standards that are more stringent than those adopted at the federal level and in certain circumstances permits state attorneys general to enforce compliance with both the state and federal laws and regulations state regulation of financial products and potential enforcement actions could also adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

the cfpb implemented a number of significant rules which will impact nearly every aspect of the life cycle of a residential mortgage the final rules require banks to among other things i develop and implement procedures to ensure compliance with a new “ability to repay” standard and identify whether a loan meets a new definition for a “qualified mortgage” ii implement new or revised disclosures policies and procedures for servicing mortgages including but not limited to early intervention with delinquent borrowers and specific loss mitigation procedures for loans secured by a borrower’s principal residence iii comply with additional restrictions on mortgage loan originator hiring and compensation iv comply with new disclosure requirements and standards for appraisals and certain financial products and v maintain escrow accounts for “higher priced mortgage loans” for a longer period of time 

protection of customer personal information and cybersecurity 

the privacy provisions of glba generally prohibit financial institutions including us from disclosing nonpublic personal financial information of consumer customers to third parties for certain purposes primarily marketing unless customers have the opportunity to opt out of the disclosure the fair credit reporting act restricts information sharing among affiliates for marketing purposes both the fair credit reporting act and regulation v issued by the frb govern the use and provision of information to consumer reporting agencies 

in march 2015 federal regulators issued two related statements regarding cybersecurity one statement indicates that financial institutions should design multiple layers of security controls to establish lines of defense and to ensure that their risk management processes also address the risk posed by compromised customer credentials including security measures to reliably authenticate customers’ accessing internetbased services of the financial institution the other statement indicates that a financial institution’s management is expected to maintain sufficient business continuity planning processes to ensure the rapid recovery resumption and maintenance of the institution’s operations after a cyberattack involving destructive malware a financial institution is also expected to develop appropriate processes to enable recovery of data and business operations and address rebuilding network capabilities and restoring data if the institution or its critical service providers fall victim to this type of cyberattack if we fail to observe the regulatory guidance we could be subject to various regulatory sanctions including financial penalties for a further discussion of risks related to cybersecurity see “risk factors” in part i item 1a of this report 

in october 2016 federal regulators jointly issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking on enhanced cyber risk management standards that are intended to increase the operational resilience of large and interconnected entities under their supervision once established the enhanced cyber risk management standards would help to reduce the potential impact of a cyberattack or other cyberrelated failure on the financial system the advance notice of proposed rulemaking addresses five categories of cyber standards i cyber risk governance ii cyber risk management iii internal dependency management iv external dependency management and v incident response cyber resilience and situational awareness we will continue to monitor any developments related to this proposed rulemaking

state regulators have also been increasingly active in implementing privacy and cybersecurity standards and regulations recently several states have adopted regulations requiring certain financial institutions to implement cybersecurity programs and providing detailed requirements with respect to these programs including data encryption requirements many states have also recently implemented or modified their data breach notification and data privacy requirements we expect this trend of statelevel activity to continue and are continually monitoring developments in the states in which we operate 

community reinvestment act requirements 

the cra requires banking regulators to evaluate us and cbna in meeting the credit needs of our local communities including providing credit to individuals residing in low and moderate income neighborhoods the cra requires each appropriate federal bank regulatory agency in connection with its examination of a depository institution to assess such institution’s record in assessing and meeting the credit needs of the community served by that institution and assign ratings the regulatory agency’s assessment of the institution’s record is made available to the public these evaluations are also considered in evaluating mergers acquisitions and applications to open a branch or facility and in the case of a bank holding company that has elected financial holding company status a cra rating of at least “satisfactory” is required to commence certain new financial activities or to acquire a company engaged in such activities we received a rating of “outstanding” in our most recent cra evaluation 

in april 2018 the us department of treasury issued a memorandum to the federal banking regulators with recommended changes to the cra’s implementing regulations to reduce their complexity and associated burden on banks and in august 2018 the occ published an advance notice of proposed rulemaking soliciting “ideas for building a new framework to transform or modernize the regulations that implement the community reinvestment act” without proposing any specific revisions to present cra requirements we will continue to evaluate the impact of any changes to the regulations implementing the cra 

compensation 

our compensation practices are subject to oversight by the frb and the occ the federal banking regulators have issued guidance designed to ensure that incentive compensation arrangements at banking organizations take into account risk and are consistent with safe and sound practices the guidance sets forth the following three key principles with respect to incentive compensation arrangements i the arrangements should provide employees with incentives that appropriately balance risk and financial results in a manner that does not encourage employees to expose their organizations to imprudent risk ii the arrangements should be compatible with effective controls and risk management and iii the arrangements should be supported by strong corporate governance the guidance provides that supervisory findings with respect to incentive compensation will be incorporated as appropriate into the organization’s supervisory ratings 

the us financial regulators including the frb the occ and the sec jointly proposed regulations in 2011 and again in 2016 to implement the incentive compensation requirements of section 956 of the doddfrank act these regulations among other things prohibit incentivebased compensation arrangements that encourage inappropriate risk taking at specified regulated entities having at least 1 billion in total assets including the parent company and cbna these regulations have not been finalized and the timing of final adoption and the form of any final regulations is uncertain if the rules are adopted in the form proposed they may restrict our flexibility with respect to the manner in which we structure compensation and adversely affect our ability to compete for talent 

antimoney laundering 

the usa patriot act enacted in 2001 and renewed in 2006 substantially broadened the scope of us antimoney laundering laws and regulations by imposing significant new compliance and due diligence obligations creating new crimes and penalties and expanding the extraterritorial jurisdiction of the united states institutions must maintain antimoney laundering programs that include established internal policies procedures and controls a designated compliance officer an ongoing employee training program and testing of the program by an independent audit function we are prohibited from entering into specified financial transactions and account relationships and must meet enhanced standards for due diligence in dealings with foreign financial institutions and foreign customers we also must take reasonable steps to conduct enhanced scrutiny of account relationships to guard against money laundering and to report any suspicious transactions recent laws provide law enforcement authorities with increased access to financial information maintained by banks 

citizens financial group inc 

business 

the usa patriot act also provides for the facilitation of information sharing among governmental entities and financial institutions for the purpose of combating terrorism and money laundering the statute also creates enhanced information collection tools and enforcement mechanics for the us government including i requiring standards for verifying customer identification at account opening ii promulgating rules to promote cooperation among financial institutions regulators and law enforcement entities in identifying parties that may be involved in terrorism or money laundering iii requiring reports by nonfinancial trades and businesses filed with the treasury’s financial crimes enforcement network “fincen” for transactions exceeding 10000 and iv mandating the filing of suspicious activities reports if a bank believes a customer may be violating us laws and regulations the statute also requires enhanced due diligence requirements for financial institutions that administer maintain or manage private bank accounts or correspondent accounts for nonus persons bank regulators routinely examine institutions for compliance with these obligations and are required to consider compliance in connection with the regulatory review of applications 

fincen drafts regulations implementing the usa patriot act and other antimoney laundering and bank secrecy act legislation in may 2018 a fincen rule became effective which requires financial institutions to obtain beneficial ownership information with respect to legal entities with which such institutions conduct business subject to certain exclusions and exemptions bank regulators are focusing their examinations on antimoney laundering compliance and we continue to monitor and augment where necessary our antimoney laundering compliance programs 

office of foreign assets control regulation 

the us has imposed economic sanctions that affect transactions with designated foreign countries nationals and others these are typically known as the “ofac” rules based on their administration by the us treasury department office of foreign assets control the ofacadministered sanctions targeting countries take many different forms generally however they contain one or more of the following elements i restrictions on trade with or investment in a sanctioned country including prohibitions against direct or indirect imports from and exports to a sanctioned country and prohibitions on us persons engaging in financial transactions relating to making investments in or providing investmentrelated advice or assistance to a sanctioned country and ii a blocking of assets in which the government or specially designated nationals of the sanctioned country have an interest by prohibiting transfers of property subject to us jurisdiction including property in the possession or control of us persons blocked assets eg property and bank deposits cannot be paid out withdrawn set off or transferred in any manner without a license from ofac ofac publishes and routinely updates lists of names of persons and organizations suspected of aiding harboring or engaging in terrorist acts including the specially designated nationals and blocked persons we are responsible for among other things blocking accounts of and transactions with such targets and countries prohibiting unlicensed trade and financial transactions with them and reporting blocked transactions after their occurrence if we find a name on any transaction account or wire transfer that is on an ofac list we must freeze such account file a suspicious activity report and notify the appropriate authorities failure to comply with these sanctions could have serious legal and reputational consequences 

regulation of brokerdealers 

our subsidiary ccmi is a registered brokerdealer with the sec and as a result is subject to regulation and examination by the sec as well as finra and other selfregulatory organizations these regulations cover a broad range of issues including capital requirements sales and trading practices use of client funds and securities the conduct of directors officers and employees recordkeeping and recording supervisory procedures to prevent improper trading on material nonpublic information qualification and licensing of sales personnel and limitations on the extension of credit in securities transactions in addition to federal registration state securities commissions require the registration of certain brokerdealers 

  heightened risk governance standards 

cbna is subject to occ guidelines imposing heightened risk governance standards on large national banks with average total consolidated assets of 50 billion or more the guidelines set forth minimum standards for the design and implementation of a bank’s risk governance framework and minimum standards for oversight of that framework by a bank’s board of directors the guidelines are intended to protect the safety and soundness of covered banks and improve bank examiners’ ability to assess compliance with the occ’s expectations under the guidelines a bank may use its parent company’s risk governance framework if the framework meets the minimum standards the risk profiles of the parent company and the covered bank are substantially the same and certain other conditions are met cbna has elected to use the parent company’s risk governance framework a bank’s board of directors is required to have two members who are independent of the bank and parent company management a bank’s board

commercial real estate lending 

lending operations that involve concentrations of commercial real estate loans are subject to enhanced scrutiny by federal banking regulators regulators have advised financial institutions of the risks posed by commercial real estate lending concentrations such loans generally include land development construction loans and loans secured by multifamily property and nonfarm nonresidential real property where the primary source of repayment is derived from rental income associated with the property the relevant regulatory guidance prescribes the following guidelines for examiners to help identify institutions that are potentially exposed to concentration risk and may warrant greater supervisory scrutiny 

 in addition the doddfrank act contains provisions that may cause us to reduce the amount of our commercial real estate lending and increase the cost of borrowing including rules relating to risk retention of securitized assets section 941 of the doddfrank act and implementing rules adopted by the us financial services regulators including the federal banking regulators and the sec require among other things a loan originator or a securitizer of assetbacked securities to retain a percentage of the credit risk of securitized assets we continue to analyze the impact that such rules have on our business

risk factors 




 item 1a risk factors 

we are subject to a number of risks potentially impacting our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows as we are a financial services organization certain elements of risk are inherent in our transactions and operations and are present in the business decisions we make we therefore encounter risk as part of the normal course of our business and we design risk management processes to help manage these risks our success is dependent on our ability to identify understand and manage the risks presented by our business activities so that we can appropriately balance revenue generation and profitability these risks include but are not limited to credit risk market risk liquidity risk operational risk model risk technology regulatory and legal risk and strategic and reputational risk we discuss our principal risk management processes and in appropriate places related historical performance in the “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — risk governance” section in part ii item 7 included in this report 

you should carefully consider the following risk factors that may affect our business financial condition and results of operations other factors that could affect our business financial condition and results of operation are discussed in the “forwardlooking statements” section above however there may be additional risks that are not presently material or known and factors besides those discussed below or in this or other reports that we file or furnish with the sec that could also adversely affect us 

risks related to our business 

we may not be able to successfully execute our business strategy 

our business strategy is designed to maximize the full potential of our business and drive sustainable growth and enhanced profitability and our success rests on our ability to i maintain a highperforming customercentric organization ii develop differentiated value propositions to acquire deepen and retain core customer segments iii build excellent capabilities that will allow us to stand out from our competitors iv operate with financial discipline and a mindset of continuous improvement to selffund investments v prudently grow and optimize our balance sheet vi modernize our technology and operational models to improve delivery agility and speed to market and vii embed risk management within our culture and our operations our future success and the value of our stock will depend in part on our ability to effectively implement our business strategy there are risks and uncertainties many of which are not within our control associated with each element of our strategy if we are not able to successfully execute our business strategy we may never achieve our financial performance goals and any shortfall may be material see “business strategy” in part i item 1 — business included in this report for further information 

supervisory requirements and expectations on us as a financial holding company and a bank holding company and any regulatorimposed limits on our activities could adversely affect our ability to implement our strategic plan expand our business continue to improve our financial performance and make capital distributions to our stockholders 

in recent years the federal banking agencies the frb the occ and the fdic as well as the cfpb have generally taken a more stringent approach to supervising and regulating financial institutions and financial products and services over which they exercise their respective supervisory authorities this increased supervisory stringency is a result of and in addition to legislation aimed at regulatory reform such as the doddfrank act and the increased capital and liquidity requirements imposed by the us implementation of the basel iii framework we and cbna and our products and services are all subject to greater supervisory scrutiny and enhanced supervisory requirements and expectations we expect to continue to face this heightened level of supervisory scrutiny and enhanced supervisory requirements in the foreseeable future 

in addition as part of the supervisory and examination process if we are unsuccessful in meeting the supervisory requirements and expectations that apply to us and cbna regulatory agencies may from time to time take supervisory actions against us that may not be publicly disclosed such actions may include restrictions on our activities or the activities of our subsidiaries informal nonpublic or formal public supervisory actions or public enforcement actions including the payment of civil money penalties which could increase our costs and limit our ability to implement our strategic plans and expand our business and as a result could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations

risk factors 

changes in interest rates may have an adverse effect on our profitability 

net interest income historically has been and in the neartomedium term we anticipate that it will remain a significant component of our total revenue this is due to the fact that a high percentage of our assets and liabilities have been and will likely continue to be in the form of interestbearing or interestrelated instruments changes in interest rates can have a material effect on many areas of our business including net interest income deposit costs loan volume and delinquency and the value of our mortgage servicing rights interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond our control including general economic conditions and policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies and in particular the federal open market committee changes in monetary policy including changes in interest rates could influence not only the interest we receive on loans and securities and the amount of interest we pay on deposits and borrowings but such changes could also affect our ability to originate loans and obtain deposits and the fair value of our financial assets and liabilities if the interest rates on our interestbearing liabilities increase at a faster pace than the interest rates on our interest earning assets our net interest income may decline and with it a decline in our earnings may occur our net interest income and our earnings would be similarly affected if the interest rates on our interest earning assets declined at a faster pace than the interest rates on our interestbearing liabilities 

we cannot control or predict with certainty changes in interest rates global national regional and local economic conditions competitive pressures and the policies of regulatory authorities including monetary policies of the frb affect interest income and interest expense although we have policies and procedures designed to manage the risks associated with changes in market interest rates as further discussed under “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — risk governance” in part ii item 7 included in this report changes in interest rates still may have an adverse effect on our profitability 

if our ongoing assumptions regarding borrower or depositor behavior are wrong or overall economic conditions are significantly different than we anticipate then our risk mitigation may be insufficient to protect against interest rate risk and our net income would be adversely affected 

changes in the method pursuant to which the libor and other benchmark rates are calculated and their potential discontinuance could adversely impact our business operations and financial results 

our floatingrate funding certain hedging transactions and certain of the products that we offer such as floatingrate loans financing transactions and derivatives in connection with our customer accommodation trading activities determine the applicable interest rate or payment amount by reference to a benchmark rate such as the london interbank offered rate “libor” or to another financial metric in the event any such benchmark rate or other referenced financial metric is significantly changed replaced or discontinued or ceases to be recognized as an acceptable market benchmark rate or financial metric there may be uncertainty or differences in the calculation of the applicable interest rate or payment amount depending on the terms of the governing instrument and there may be significant work required to transition to any new benchmark rate or other financial metric 

in response to concerns regarding the reliability and robustness of commonly used reference rates in particular libor the financial stability oversight council and financial stability board called for the development of alternative interest rate benchmarks in 2014 the board of governors of the federal reserve system and the federal reserve bank of new york convened the alternative reference rates committee “arrc” in order to identify best practices for alternative reference rates identify best practices for contract robustness develop an adoption plan and create an implementation plan with metrics of success and a timeline in june 2017 the arrc identified the secured overnight financing rate “sofr” as its recommended alternative to us dollar libor for use in certain new us dollar derivatives and other financial instruments furthermore in july 2017 the chief executive of the uk financial conduct authority “fca” announced that the fca intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of libor after 2021 this announcement indicates that the continuation of libor on the current basis cannot and will not be guaranteed after 2021

despite progress made to date by regulators and industry participants to prepare for the anticipated discontinuation of libor significant uncertainties still remain such uncertainties relate to for example whether libor will continue to be viewed as an acceptable market benchmark rate what rate or rates may become accepted alternatives to libor whether different benchmark rates may become accepted alternatives to libor for different types of transactions and financial instruments how the terms of any transaction or financial instrument will be adjusted to account for differences between libor and any alternative rate selected for example if sofr is used as an alternative various adjustments including a credit spread adjustment may be necessary to reflect that sofr is a secured overnight rate and libor is a term unsecured rate how any replacement would be implemented across the industry and the effect of any changes in industry views or movement to alternative benchmarks would have on the markets for liborlinked financial instruments 

the discontinuation of a benchmark rate or other financial metric changes in a benchmark rate or other financial metric or changes in market perceptions of the acceptability of a benchmark rate or other financial metric including libor could among other things adversely affect the value of and return on certain of our financial instruments or products result in changes to our risk exposures or require renegotiation of previous transactions in addition any such discontinuation or changes whether actual or anticipated could result in market volatility adverse tax or accounting effects increased compliance legal and operational costs and risks associated with customer disclosures and contract negotiations 

we could fail to attract retain or motivate highly skilled and qualified personnel including our senior management other key employees or members of our board which could impair our ability to successfully execute our strategic plan and otherwise adversely affect our business 

a cornerstone of our strategic plan involves the hiring of highly skilled and qualified personnel accordingly our ability to implement our strategic plan and our future success depends on our ability to attract retain and motivate highly skilled and qualified personnel including our senior management and other key employees and directors competitive with our peers the marketplace for skilled personnel is becoming more competitive which means the cost of hiring incentivizing and retaining skilled personnel may continue to increase the failure to attract or retain including as a result of an untimely death or illness of key personnel or replace a sufficient number of appropriately skilled and key personnel could place us at a significant competitive disadvantage and prevent us from successfully implementing our strategy which could impair our ability to implement our strategic plan successfully achieve our performance targets and otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

limitations on the manner in which regulated financial institutions such as citizens can compensate their officers and employees including those contained in pending rule proposals implementing requirements of section 956 of the doddfrank act may make it more difficult for such institutions to compete for talent with financial institutions and other companies not subject to these or similar limitations if citizens is unable to compete effectively our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected perhaps materially 

our ability to meet our obligations and the cost of funds to do so depend on our ability to access identified sources of liquidity at a reasonable cost 

liquidity risk is the risk that we will not be able to meet our obligations including funding commitments as they come due this risk is inherent in our operations and can be heightened by a number of factors including an overreliance on a particular source of funding including for example secured fhlb advances changes in credit ratings or marketwide phenomena such as market dislocation and major disasters like many banking groups our reliance on customer deposits to meet a considerable portion of our funding has grown over recent years and we continue to seek to increase the proportion of our funding represented by customer deposits however these deposits are subject to fluctuation due to certain factors outside our control such as increasing competitive pressures for retail or corporate customer deposits changes in interest rates and returns on other investment classes or a loss of confidence by customers in us or in the banking sector generally which could result in a significant outflow of deposits within a short period of time to the extent there is heightened competition among us banks for retail customer deposits this competition may increase the cost of procuring new deposits andor retaining existing deposits and otherwise negatively affect our ability to grow our deposit base an inability to grow or any material decrease in our deposits could have a material adverse effect on our ability to satisfy our liquidity needs 

maintaining a diverse and appropriate funding strategy for our assets consistent with our wider strategic risk appetite and plan remains challenging and any tightening of credit markets could have a material adverse 

citizens financial group inc 

risk factors 

impact on us in particular there is a risk that corporate and financial institution counterparties may seek to reduce their credit exposures to banks and other financial institutions for example reductions in unsecured deposits supplied by these counterparties which may cause funding from these sources to no longer be available under these circumstances we may need to seek funds from alternative sources potentially at higher costs than has previously been the case or may be required to consider disposals of other assets not previously identified for disposal in order to reduce our funding commitments 

a reduction in our credit ratings which are based on a number of factors could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

credit ratings affect the cost and other terms upon which we are able to obtain funding rating agencies regularly evaluate us and their ratings are based on a number of factors including our financial strength other factors considered by rating agencies include conditions affecting the financial services industry generally any downgrade in our ratings would likely increase our borrowing costs could limit our access to capital markets and otherwise adversely affect our business for example a ratings downgrade could adversely affect our ability to sell or market certain of our securities including longterm debt engage in certain longerterm derivatives transactions and retain our customers particularly corporate customers who may require a minimum rating threshold in order to place funds with us in addition under the terms of certain of our derivatives contracts we may be required to maintain a minimum credit rating or have to post additional collateral or terminate such contracts any of these results of a rating downgrade could increase our cost of funding reduce our liquidity and have adverse effects on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our financial performance may be adversely affected by deterioration in borrower credit quality particularly in the new england midatlantic and midwest regions where our operations are concentrated 

we have exposure to many different industries and risks arising from actual or perceived changes in credit quality and uncertainty over the recoverability of amounts due from borrowers is inherent in our businesses our exposure may be exacerbated by the geographic concentration of our operations which are predominately located in the new england midatlantic and midwest regions the credit quality of our borrowers may deteriorate for a number of reasons that are outside our control including as a result of prevailing economic and market conditions and asset valuation the trends and risks affecting borrower credit quality particularly in the new england midatlantic and midwest regions have caused and in the future may cause us to experience impairment charges increased repurchase demands higher costs additional writedowns and losses and an inability to engage in routine funding transactions which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our framework for managing risks may not be effective in mitigating risk and loss 

our risk management framework is made up of various processes and strategies to manage our risk exposure the framework to manage risk including the framework’s underlying assumptions may not be effective under all conditions and circumstances if the risk management framework proves ineffective we could suffer unexpected losses and could be materially adversely affected 

one of the main types of risks inherent in our business is credit risk an important feature of our credit risk management system is to employ an internal credit risk control system through which we identify measure monitor and mitigate existing and emerging credit risk of our customers as this process involves detailed analyses of the customer or credit risk taking into account both quantitative and qualitative factors it is subject to human error in exercising their judgment our employees may not always be able to assign an accurate credit rating to a customer or credit risk which may result in our exposure to higher credit risks than indicated by our risk rating system 

in addition we have undertaken certain actions to enhance our credit policies and guidelines to address potential risks associated with particular industries or types of customers as discussed in more detail under “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — risk governance” and “— market risk” in part ii item 7 included in this report however we may not be able to effectively implement these initiatives or consistently follow and refine our credit risk management system if any of the foregoing were to occur it may result in an increase in the level of nonperforming loans and a higher risk exposure for us which could have a material adverse effect on us

changes in our accounting policies or in accounting standards could materially affect how we report our financial results and condition 

from time to time the fasb and sec change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of our financial statements these changes can be operationally complex to implement and can materially impact how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations for example in june 2016 the fasb issued accounting standards update 201613 measurement of credit losses on financial instruments  “asu 201613” that will effective january 1 2020 substantially change the accounting for credit losses on loans and other financial assets held by banks financial institutions and other organizations the standard replaces existing incurred loss impairment guidance and establishes a single allowance framework for financial assets carried at amortized cost upon adoption of asu 201613 companies must recognize credit losses on these assets equal to management’s estimate of credit losses over the full remaining expected life companies must consider all relevant information when estimating expected credit losses including details about past events current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts in december 2018 the federal reserve occ and fdic released a final rule to revise their regulatory capital rules to address this upcoming change to the treatment of credit expense and allowances the final rule provides an optional threeyear phasein period for the dayone adverse regulatory capital effects upon adopting the standard the impact of this final rule on citizens and cbna will depend on whether we elect to phase in the impact of the standard over a threeyear period the standard is likely to have a negative impact potentially materially to the allowance and capital at adoption in 2020 however citizens is still evaluating the impact it is also possible that citizens’ ongoing reported earnings and lending activity will be negatively impacted in periods following adoption 

our financial and accounting estimates and risk management framework rely on analytical forecasting and models 

the processes we use to estimate our inherent loan losses and to measure the fair value of financial instruments as well as the processes used to estimate the effects of changing interest rates and other market measures on our financial condition and results of operations depends upon the use of analytical and forecasting models some of our tools and metrics for managing risk are based upon our use of observed historical market behavior we rely on quantitative models to measure risks and to estimate certain financial values models may be used in such processes as determining the pricing of various products grading loans and extending credit measuring interest rate and other market risks predicting losses assessing capital adequacy and calculating regulatory capital levels as well as estimating the value of financial instruments and balance sheet items poorly designed or implemented models present the risk that our business decisions based on information incorporating such models will be adversely affected due to the inadequacy of that information moreover our models may fail to predict future risk exposures if the information used in the model is incorrect obsolete or not sufficiently comparable to actual events as they occur we seek to incorporate appropriate historical data in our models but the range of market values and behaviors reflected in any period of historical data is not at all times predictive of future developments in any particular period and the period of data we incorporate into our models may turn out to be inappropriate for the future period being modeled in such case our ability to manage risk would be limited and our risk exposure and losses could be significantly greater than our models indicated in addition if existing or potential customers believe our risk management is inadequate they could take their business elsewhere this could harm our reputation as well as our revenues and profits finally information we provide to our regulators based on poorly designed or implemented models could also be inaccurate or misleading some of the decisions that our regulators make including those related to capital distributions to our stockholders could be affected adversely due to their perception that the quality of the models used to generate the relevant information is insufficient 

the preparation of our financial statements requires the use of estimates that may vary from actual results particularly various factors may cause our alll to increase 

the preparation of audited consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make significant estimates that affect the financial statements our most critical accounting estimate is the alll the alll is a reserve established through a provision for loan and lease losses charged to expense and represents our estimate of incurred but unrealized losses within the existing portfolio of loans the alll is necessary to reserve for estimated loan and lease losses and risks inherent in the loan portfolio the level of the alll reflects our ongoing evaluation of industry concentrations specific credit risks loan and lease loss experience current loan portfolio quality present economic political and regulatory conditions and incurred losses inherent in the current loan portfolio 

citizens financial group inc 

risk factors 

the determination of the appropriate level of the alll inherently involves a degree of subjectivity and requires that we make significant estimates of current credit risks and future trends all of which may undergo material changes changes in economic conditions affecting borrowers the stagnation of certain economic indicators that we are more susceptible to such as unemployment and real estate values new information regarding existing loans identification of additional problem loans and other factors both within and outside our control may require an increase in the alll in addition bank regulatory agencies periodically review our alll and may require an increase in the alll or the recognition of further loan chargeoffs based on judgments that can differ from those of our own management in addition if chargeoffs in future periods exceed the alll—that is if the alll is inadequate—we will need additional loan and lease loss provisions to increase the alll should such additional provisions become necessary they would result in a decrease in net income and capital and may have a material adverse effect on us 

operational risks are inherent in our businesses 

our operations depend on our ability to process a very large number of transactions efficiently and accurately while complying with applicable laws and regulations operational risk and losses can result from internal and external fraud improper conduct or errors by employees or third parties failure to document transactions properly or to obtain proper authorization failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements and conduct of business rules equipment failures including those caused by natural disasters or by electrical telecommunications or other essential utility outages business continuity and data security system failures including those caused by computer viruses cyberattacks or unforeseen problems encountered while implementing major new computer systems or upgrades to existing systems or the inadequacy or failure of systems and controls including those of our suppliers or counterparties although we have implemented risk controls and loss mitigation actions and substantial resources are devoted to developing efficient procedures identifying and rectifying weaknesses in existing procedures and training staff it is not possible to be certain that such actions have been or will be effective in controlling each of the operational risks faced by us any weakness in these systems or controls or any breaches or alleged breaches of such laws or regulations could result in increased regulatory supervision enforcement actions and other disciplinary action and have an adverse impact on our business applicable authorizations and licenses reputation and results of operations 

the financial services industry including the banking sector is undergoing rapid technological changes as a result of competition and changes in the legal and regulatory framework and we may not be able to compete effectively as a result of these changes 

the financial services industry including the banking sector is continually undergoing rapid technological change with frequent introductions of new technologydriven products and services in addition new unexpected technological changes could have a disruptive effect on the way banks offer products and services we believe our success depends to a great extent on our ability to address customer needs by using technology to offer products and services that provide convenience to customers and to create additional efficiencies in our operations however we may not be able to among other things keep up with the rapid pace of technological changes effectively implement new technologydriven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to our customers as a result our ability to compete effectively to attract or retain new business may be impaired and our business financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected 

in addition changes in the legal and regulatory framework under which we operate require us to update our information systems to ensure compliance our need to review and evaluate the impact of ongoing rule proposals final rules and implementation guidance from regulators further complicates the development and implementation of new information systems for our business also recent regulatory guidance has focused on the need for financial institutions to perform increased due diligence and ongoing monitoring of thirdparty vendor relationships thus increasing the scope of management involvement and decreasing the efficiency otherwise resulting from our relationships with thirdparty technology providers given the significant number of ongoing regulatory reform initiatives it is possible that we incur higher than expected information technology costs in order to comply with current and impending regulations see “—supervisory requirements and expectations on us as a financial holding company and a bank holding company and any regulatorimposed limits on our activities could adversely affect our ability to implement our strategic plan expand our business continue to improve our financial performance and make capital distributions to our stockholders”

we are subject to a variety of cybersecurity risks that if realized could adversely affect how we conduct our business 

information security risks for large financial institutions such as cfg have increased significantly in recent years in part because of the proliferation of new technologies such as internet and mobile banking to conduct financial transactions and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime hackers terrorists nationstates activists and other external parties third parties with whom we or our customers do business also present operational and information security risks to us including security breaches or failures of their own systems the possibility of employee error failure to follow security procedures or malfeasance also presents these risks our operations rely on the secure processing transmission and storage of confidential information in our computer systems and networks in addition to access our products and services our customers may use personal computers smartphones tablets and other mobile devices that are beyond our control environment although we believe that we have appropriate information security procedures and controls our technologies systems networks and our customers’ devices may be the target of cyberattacks or information security breaches that could result in the unauthorized release gathering monitoring misuse loss or destruction of the confidential andor proprietary information of cfg our customers our vendors our counterparties or our employees we are under continuous threat of loss due to cyberattacks especially as we continue to expand customer capabilities to utilize the internet and other remote channels to transact business two of the most significant cyberattack risks that we face are efraud and loss of sensitive customer data loss from efraud occurs when cybercriminals extract funds directly from customers’ or our accounts using fraudulent schemes that may include internetbased funds transfers we have been subject to a number of efraud incidents historically we have also been subject to attempts to steal sensitive customer data such as account numbers and social security numbers through unauthorized access to our computer systems including computer hacking such attacks are less frequent but could present significant reputational legal and regulatory costs to us if successful we have implemented certain technology protections such as customer profiling and setup authentication to be in compliance with the ffiec authentication in internet banking environment “aibe” guidelines 

as cyber threats continue to evolve we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our layers of defense or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities system enhancements and updates may also create risks associated with implementing new systems and integrating them with existing ones due to the complexity and interconnectedness of information technology systems the process of enhancing our layers of defense can itself create a risk of systems disruptions and security issues in addition addressing certain information security vulnerabilities such as hardwarebased vulnerabilities may affect the performance of our information technology systems the ability of our hardware and software providers to deliver patches and updates to mitigate vulnerabilities in a timely manner can introduce additional risks particularly when a vulnerability is being actively exploited by threat actors 

despite our efforts to prevent a cyberattack a successful cyberattack could persist for an extended period of time before being detected and following detection it could take considerable time for us to obtain full and reliable information about the cybersecurity incident and the extent amount and type of information compromised during the course of an investigation we may not necessarily know the full effects of the incident or how to remediate it and actions and decisions that are taken or made in an effort to mitigate risk may further increase the costs and other negative consequences of the incident 

the techniques used by cyber criminals change frequently may not be recognized until launched and can be initiated from a variety of sources including terrorist organizations and hostile foreign governments these actors may attempt to fraudulently induce employees customers or other users of our systems to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to data or our systems in the event that a cyberattack is successful our business financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected for a discussion of the guidance that federal banking regulators have released regarding cybersecurity and cyber risk management standards see “regulation and supervision” in part i item 1 — business included in this report

security breach will not occur or if they do occur that they will be adequately addressed the occurrence of any failure interruption or security breach of our information systems could require us to devote substantial resources including management time and attention to recovery and response efforts damage our reputation result in a loss of customer business subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny or expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability although we maintain insurance coverage for information security events we may incur losses as a result of such events that are not insured against or not fully covered by our insurance 

we rely on third parties for the performance of a significant portion of our information technology 

we rely on third parties for the performance of a significant portion of our information technology functions and the provision of information technology and business process services for example i unaffiliated third parties operate data communications networks on which certain components and services relating to our online banking system rely ii third parties host or maintain many of our applications including our commercial loan system which is hosted and maintained by automated financial systems inc iii fidelity national information services inc maintains our core deposits system and iv ibm corporation provides us with a wide range of information technology support services including end user data center network mainframe storage and database services the success of our business depends in part on the continuing ability of these and other third parties to perform these functions and services in a timely and satisfactory manner which performance could be disrupted or otherwise adversely affected due to failures or other information security events originating at the third parties or at the third parties’ suppliers or vendors socalled “fourth party risk” we may not be able to effectively monitor or mitigate fourthparty risk in particular as it relates to the use of common suppliers or vendors by the third parties that perform functions and services for us if we experience a disruption in the provision of any functions or services performed by third parties we may have difficulty in finding alternate providers on terms favorable to us and in reasonable timeframes if these services are not performed in a satisfactory manner we would not be able to serve our customers well in either situation our business could incur significant costs and be adversely affected 

we are exposed to reputational risk and the risk of damage to our brands and the brands of our affiliates 

our success and results depend in part on our reputation and the strength of our brands we are vulnerable to adverse market perception as we operate in an industry where integrity customer trust and confidence are paramount we are exposed to the risk that litigation employee misconduct operational failures the outcome of regulatory or other investigations or actions press speculation and negative publicity among other factors could damage our brands or reputation our brands and reputation could also be harmed if we sell products or services that do not perform as expected or customers’ expectations for the product are not satisfied 

we may be adversely affected by unpredictable catastrophic events or terrorist attacks and our business continuity and disaster recovery plans may not adequately protect us from serious disaster 

the occurrence of catastrophic events such as hurricanes tropical storms tornadoes and other largescale catastrophes and terrorist attacks could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations if a catastrophe rendered both our production data center in rhode island and our recovery data center in north carolina unusable although we enhanced our disaster recovery capabilities in 2016 through the completion of the new outofregion backup data center in north carolina there can be no assurance that our current disaster recovery plans and capabilities will adequately protect us from serious disaster

any deterioration in national economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our business is affected by national economic conditions as well as perceptions of those conditions and future economic prospects changes in such economic conditions are not predictable and cannot be controlled adverse economic conditions could require us to charge off a higher percentage of loans and increase the provision for credit losses which would reduce our net income and otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations for example our business was significantly affected by the global economic and financial crisis that began in 2008 the falling home prices increased rate of foreclosure and high levels of unemployment in the united states triggered significant writedowns by us and other financial institutions these writedowns adversely impacted our financial results in material respects although the us economy

continues to recover an interruption or reversal of this recovery would adversely affect the financial services industry and banking sector 

we operate in an industry that is highly competitive which could result in losing business or margin declines and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we operate in a highly competitive industry the industry could become even more competitive as a result of reform of the financial services industry resulting from the doddfrank act and other legislative regulatory and technological changes as well as continued consolidation we face aggressive competition from other domestic and foreign lending institutions and from numerous other providers of financial services including nonbanking financial institutions that are not subject to the same regulatory restrictions as banks and bank holding companies securities firms and insurance companies and competitors that may have greater financial resources 

with respect to nonbanking financial institutions technology and other changes have lowered barriers to entry and made it possible for nonbanks to offer products and services traditionally provided by banks for example consumers can maintain funds that would have historically been held as bank deposits in brokerage accounts or mutual funds consumers can also complete transactions such as paying bills andor transferring funds directly without the assistance of banks the process of eliminating banks as intermediaries known as “disintermediation” could result in the loss of fee income as well as the loss of customer deposits and the related income generated from those deposits some of our nonbank competitors are not subject to the same extensive regulations we are and therefore may have greater flexibility in competing for business as a result of these and other sources of competition we could lose business to competitors or be forced to price products and services on less advantageous terms to retain or attract clients either of which would adversely affect our profitability and business 

the conditions of other financial institutions or of the financial services industry could adversely affect our operations and financial conditions 

financial services institutions are typically interconnected as a result of trading investment liquidity management clearing counterparty and other relationships within the financial services industry the default by any one institution could lead to defaults by other institutions concerns about or a default by one institution could lead to significant liquidity problems and losses or defaults by other institutions as the commercial and financial soundness of many financial institutions are closely related as a result of these credit trading clearing and other relationships even the perceived lack of creditworthiness of or questions about a counterparty may lead to marketwide liquidity problems and losses or defaults by various institutions this systemic risk may adversely affect financial intermediaries such as clearing agencies banks and exchanges with which we interact on a daily basis or key funding providers such as the fhlbs any of which could have a material adverse effect on our access to liquidity or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

risks related to regulations governing our industry

we may be unable to disclose some restrictions or limitations on our operations imposed by our regulators 

from time to time bank regulatory agencies take supervisory actions that restrict or limit a financial institution’s activities and lead it to raise capital or subject it to other requirements directives issued to enforce such actions may be confidential and thus in some instances we are not permitted to publicly disclose these actions in addition as part of our regular examination process our and cbna’s respective regulators may advise us or cbna to operate under various restrictions as a prudential matter any such actions or restrictions if and in whatever manner imposed could adversely affect our costs and revenues moreover efforts to comply with any such nonpublic supervisory actions or restrictions may require material investments in additional resources and systems as well as a significant commitment of managerial time and attention as a result such supervisory actions or restrictions if and in whatever manner imposed could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations and in certain instances we may not be able to publicly disclose these matters 

the regulatory environment in which we operate continues to be subject to significant and evolving regulatory requirements that could have a material adverse effect on our business and earnings 

we are heavily regulated by multiple banking consumer protection securities and other regulatory authorities at the federal and state levels this regulatory oversight is primarily established to protect depositors the fdic’s deposit insurance fund consumers of financial products and the financial system as a whole not our security holders changes to statutes regulations rules or policies including the interpretation implementation or enforcement of statutes regulations rules or policies could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways including by for example subjecting us to additional costs limiting the types of financial services and other products we may offer limiting our ability to pursue acquisitions and increasing the ability of third parties including nonbanks to offer competing financial services and products in recent years we together with the rest of the financial services industry have faced particularly intense scrutiny with many new regulatory initiatives and vigorous oversight and enforcement on the part of numerous regulatory and governmental authorities legislatures and regulators have pursued a broad array of initiatives intended to promote the safety and soundness of financial institutions financial market stability the transparency and liquidity of financial markets and consumer and investor protection certain regulators and law enforcement authorities have also recently required admissions of wrongdoing and in some cases criminal pleas as part of the resolutions of matters brought by them against financial institutions any such resolution of a matter involving us could lead to increased exposure to civil litigation could adversely affect our reputation could result in penalties or limitations on our ability to do business or engage in certain activities and could have other negative effects in addition a single event or issue may give rise to numerous and overlapping investigations and proceedings including by multiple federal and state regulators and other governmental authorities 

we are also subject to laws and regulations relating to the privacy of the information of our customers employees counterparties and others and any failure to comply with these laws and regulations could expose us to liability andor reputational damage as new privacyrelated laws and regulations are implemented the time and resources needed for us to comply with those laws and regulations as well as our potential liability for noncompliance and our reporting obligations in the case of data breaches may significantly increase 

there have been significant revisions to the laws and regulations applicable to citizens that have been enacted or proposed in recent months these and other rules to implement the changes have yet to be finalized and the final timing scope and impact of these changes to the regulatory framework applicable to financial institutions remain uncertain for more information on the regulations to which we are subject and recent initiatives

in regulatory actions such as those referred to above it is inherently difficult to determine whether any loss is probable or whether it is possible to reasonably estimate the amount of any loss we cannot predict with certainty if how or when such proceedings will be resolved or what the eventual fine penalty or other relief conditions or restrictions if any may be particularly for actions that are in their early stages of investigation we may be required to make significant restitution payments to cbna customers arising from certain compliance issues and also may be required to pay civil money penalties in connection with certain of these issues this uncertainty makes it difficult to estimate probable losses which in turn can lead to substantial disparities between the reserves

we may establish for such proceedings and the eventual settlements fines or penalties adverse regulatory actions could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are and may be subject to litigation that may have a material impact on our business 

our operations are diverse and complex and we operate in legal and regulatory environments that expose us to potentially significant litigation risk in the normal course of business we have been named from time to time as a defendant in various legal actions including arbitrations class actions and other litigation arising in connection with our activities as a financial services institution including with respect to alleged unfair or deceptive business practices and misselling of certain products certain of the actual or threatened legal actions include claims for substantial compensatory andor punitive damages or claims for indeterminate amounts of damages in some cases the entities that would otherwise be the primary defendants in such cases are bankrupt or in financial distress moreover a number of recent judicial decisions have upheld the right of borrowers to sue lending institutions on the basis of various evolving legal theories collectively termed “lender liability” generally lender liability is founded on the premise that a lender has either violated a duty whether implied or contractual of good faith and fair dealing owed to the borrower or has assumed a degree of control over the borrower resulting in the creation of a fiduciary duty owed to the borrower or its other creditors or stockholders this could increase the amount of private litigation to which we are subject for more information regarding ongoing significant legal proceedings in which we may be involved see note 18 “commitments and contingencies” to our audited consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 — financial statements and supplementary data included in this report 

compliance with antimoney laundering and antiterrorism financing rules involve significant cost and effort 

we are subject to rules and regulations regarding money laundering and the financing of terrorism monitoring compliance with antimoney laundering and antiterrorism financing rules can put a significant financial burden on banks and other financial institutions and poses significant technical challenges although we believe our current policies and procedures are sufficient to comply with applicable rules and regulations we cannot guarantee that our antimoney laundering and antiterrorism financing policies and procedures completely prevent situations of money laundering or terrorism financing any such failure events may have severe consequences including sanctions fines and reputational consequences which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

we may become subject to more stringent regulatory requirements and activity restrictions or have to restructure if the frb and fdic jointly determine that our resolution plan is not credible   

bank holding companies with more than 100 billion in assets are currently required to submit resolution plans that in the event of material financial distress or failure establish the rapid orderly and systemically safe liquidation of the company under the us bankruptcy code separately insured depository institutions with more than 50 billion in assets must submit to the fdic a resolution plan whereby they can be resolved in a manner that is orderly and that ensures that depositors will receive access to insured funds within certain required timeframes if the frb and the fdic jointly determine that the resolution plan of a bank holding company is not credible and the company fails to cure the deficiencies in a timely manner then the frb and the fdic may jointly impose on the company or on any of its subsidiaries more stringent capital leverage or liquidity requirements or restrictions on growth activities or operations or require the divestment of certain assets or operations if the frb and the fdic jointly determine that our resolution plan is not credible or would not facilitate our orderly resolution under the us bankruptcy code we could become subject to more stringent regulatory requirements or business restrictions or have to divest certain of our assets or businesses any such measures could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations

risk factors 

risks related to our common stock 

our stock price may be volatile and you could lose all or part of your investment as a result 

you should consider an investment in our common stock to be risky and you should invest in our common stock only if you can withstand a significant loss and wide fluctuation in the market value of your investment the market price of our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to among other things the factors described in this “risk factors” section and other factors some of which are beyond our control these factors include 

 furthermore the stock markets have experienced price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market price of equity securities of many companies these fluctuations have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies these broad market fluctuations as well as general economic systemic political and market conditions such as recessions loss of investor confidence interest rate changes or international currency fluctuations may negatively affect the market price of our common stock 

if any of the foregoing occurs it could cause our stock price to fall and may expose us to securities class action litigation that even if unsuccessful could be costly to defend and a distraction to management 

we may not repurchase shares or pay cash dividends on our common stock 

holders of our common stock are only entitled to receive such dividends as our board of directors may declare out of funds legally available for such payments although we have historically declared cash dividends on our common stock we are not required to do so and may reduce or eliminate our common stock dividend in the future this could adversely affect the market price of our common stock also as a bank holding company our ability to repurchase shares and declare and pay dividends is dependent on certain federal regulatory considerations including the rules of the frb regarding capital adequacy and dividends additionally we are required to submit periodic capital plans to the frb for review or otherwise obtain frb authorization before we can take certain capital actions including repurchasing shares declaring and paying dividends or repurchasing or redeeming capital securities if our capital plan or any amendment to our capital plan is objected to for any reason our ability to repurchase shares and declare and pay dividends on our capital stock may be limited further if we are unable to satisfy the capital requirements applicable to us for any reason we may be limited in our ability to repurchase shares and declare and pay dividends on our capital stock see “regulation and supervision” in part i item 1 — business included in this report for further discussion of the regulations to which we are subject 

“antitakeover” provisions and the regulations to which we are subject may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us even if the change in control would be beneficial to stockholders 

we are a bank holding company incorporated in the state of delaware antitakeover provisions in delaware law and our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws as well as regulatory approvals that would be required under federal law could make it more difficult for a third party to take control of us and may prevent stockholders from receiving a premium for their shares of our common stock these provisions could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and could reduce the amount that stockholders might get if we are sold 

we believe these provisions protect our stockholders from coercive or otherwise unfair takeover tactics by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with our board and by providing our board with more time to assess any acquisition proposal however these provisions apply even if the offer may be determined to be beneficial by some

stockholders and could delay or prevent an acquisition that our board determines is not in our best interest and that of our stockholders 

furthermore banking laws impose notice approval and ongoing regulatory requirements on any stockholder or other party that seeks to acquire direct or indirect “control” of an fdicinsured depository institution these laws include the bank holding company act and the change in bank control act

key performance metrics used by management and nongaap financial measures 

as a banking institution we manage and evaluate aspects of our results of operations and our financial condition we evaluate the levels and trends of the line items included in our balance sheet and statement of operations as well as various financial ratios that are commonly used in our industry we analyze these ratios and financial trends against our own historical performance our budgeted performance and the financial condition and performance of comparable banking institutions in our region and nationally 

the primary line items we use in our key performance metrics to manage and evaluate our statement of operations include net interest income noninterest income total revenue provision for credit losses noninterest expense net income and net income available to common stockholders the primary line items we use in our key performance metrics to manage and evaluate our balance sheet data include loans and leases securities allowance for credit losses deposits borrowed funds and derivatives 

we consider various measures when evaluating our performance and making daytoday operating decisions as well as evaluating capital utilization and adequacy including 

 this document contains nongaap financial measures denoted as “underlying” or “adjustedunderlying” results underlying or adjustedunderlying results for any given reporting period exclude certain items that may

management’s discussion and analysis 

occur in that period which management does not consider indicative of the company’s ongoing financial performance we believe these nongaap financial measures provide useful information to investors because they are used by management to evaluate our operating performance and make daytoday operating decisions in addition we believe our underlying or adjustedunderlying results in any given reporting period reflect our ongoing financial performance in that period and accordingly are useful to consider in addition to our gaap financial results we further believe the presentation of underlying or adjustedunderlying results increases comparability of periodtoperiod results 

other companies may use similarly titled nongaap financial measures that are calculated differently from the way we calculate such measures accordingly our nongaap financial measures may not be comparable to similar measures used by such companies we caution investors not to place undue reliance on such nongaap financial measures but to consider them with the most directly comparable gaap measures nongaap financial measures have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for our results reported under gaap 

nongaap measures are denoted throughout “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” by the use of the term underlying or adjustedunderlying andor are followed by an asterisk

management’s discussion and analysis 

net interest margin of 319   increase d 17  basis points compared to 302  in the year ended   2017  driven by higher interestearning asset yields given higher interest rates and continued mix shift toward higheryielding assets these results were partially offset by the impact of higher deposit and other funding costs average interestearning asset yields of 405   increase d 49  basis points from 356  for the year ended   2017  while average interestbearing liability costs of 119   increase d 44  basis points from 075  for the year ended   2017  

average interestearning assets of 1413 billion   increase d  38 billion  or 3  from the year ended   2017  driven by a 25 billion   increase  in average commercial loans and leases and a 17 billion   increase  in average retail loans partially offset by a 692 million   decrease  in average investments and interestbearing cash and due from banks and deposits in banks commercial loan growth was driven by commercial and commercial real estate retail loan growth was driven by residential mortgage education and other retail 

average deposits of 1159 billion   increase d 40 billion  from the year ended   2017  reflecting growth in term deposits savings demand deposits and checking with interest total interestbearing deposit costs of 785 million   increase d 344 million  or 78  from 441 million  in 2017  primarily due to rising rates 

average total borrowed funds of 159 billion   increase d 341 million  from the year ended   2017  reflecting an increase  in long term borrowed funds primarily senior debt partially offset by a decrease in other shortterm borrowed funds and a decrease in federal funds purchased and repurchase agreements the total borrowed funds costs of 276   increase d 80  basis points from 196  for the year ended   2017  due to an increase in longterm rates and a mix shift to longterm senior debt

2 2018 noninterest income amounts reflect the adoption of asu 201409  revenue from contracts with customers topic 606 

noninterest income of 16 billion  in 2018  increase d 62 million  or 4  compared to 15 billion  in 2017  driven by strength in mortgage banking fees reflecting the 57 million impact of famc as well as foreign exchange and interest rate products trust and investment services fees card fees and letter of credit and loan fees partially offset by lower capital market fees and service charges and fees excluding the impact of notable items and 2017 aircraft finance lease impairments underlying noninterest income for the year ended 2018 increased 73 million or 5 

provision for credit losses 

provision for credit losses of 326 million   increase d 5 million  or 2  from 321 million  in 2017  which reflected moderately lower reserve growth and partially offset slightly higher net chargeoffs full year 2018  results reflected a 9 million  reserve build compared to a 16 million  reserve build in 2017  net chargeoffs in 2018  of 317 million were 12 million higher compared to 2017 on an underlying basis total creditrelated costs decreased 21 million primarily due to the impact of 2017 aircraft lease impairments

management’s discussion and analysis 

60 million of famc costs primarily in salaries and employee benefits and 54 million of famc integration costs and other notable items these increases were partially offset by lower other operating expenses excluding famc integration costs other notable items and the impact of 2017 aircraft operating lease impairments underlying noninterest expense increased 146 million or 4 

income tax expense 

income tax expense of 462 million   increase d 202 million  or 78  from 260 million  in 2017  the 2018 effective tax rate of 212  increased from 136  in 2017  primarily attributable to the revaluation of our deferred tax liability as a result of 2017 tax legislation on an underlying basis the effective income tax rate decreased to 225  from 322  in 2017 primarily attributable to the reduction in the federal statutory tax rate from 35 to 21 under the 2017 tax legislation partially offset by an increase in state and local income taxes and nondeductible fdic premiums 

at december 31 2018  our net deferred tax liability of 573 million  compared to a 571 million  liability at december 31 2017  the increase in the net deferred tax liability was primarily attributable to the tax effect of differences in the timing of deductions and income items for financial statement purposes versus taxable income purposes almost fully offset by the tax effect of the net unrealized losses on securities and derivatives arising during the period for further discussion see note 22 “income taxes” to our consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 — financial statements and supplementary data included in this report

     enhanced our assumptions for the liquidity and deposit components within our ftp methodology which provides a credit for sources of funds and a charge for 

       the use of funds by each business operating segment the enhancement largely provides increased credit for the stability of deposit composition and an increased

citizens financial group inc 

management’s discussion and analysis 

we have two business operating segments consumer banking and commercial banking segment results are derived by specifically attributing managed assets liabilities capital and related revenues provision for credit losses and expenses nonsegment operations are classified as other which includes corporate functions the treasury function the securities portfolio wholesale funding activities intangible assets community development noncore assets including legacy royal bank of scotland group plc aircraft loan and leasing and other unallocated assets liabilities capital revenues provision for credit losses expenses and income tax expense for a description of noncore assets see “—analysis of financial condition — allowance for credit losses and nonperforming assets — noncore assets” in addition other includes goodwill and any associated goodwill impairment charges for impairment testing purposes we allocate goodwill to consumer banking and commercial banking reporting units 

our capital levels are evaluated and managed centrally however capital is allocated on a riskadjusted basis considering economic and regulatory capital requirements to the business operating segments to support evaluation of business performance because funding and asset liability management is a central function funds transferpricing “ftp” methodologies are utilized to allocate a cost of funds used or credit for the funds provided to all business operating segment assets liabilities and capital respectively using a matchedfunding concept the residual effect on net interest income of assetliability management including the residual net interest income related to the ftp process is included in other we periodically evaluate and refine our methodologies used to measure financial performance of our business operating segments 

provision for credit losses is allocated to each business operating segment based on respective actual net chargeoffs the difference between the consolidated provision for credit losses and the business operating segments’ net chargeoffs is reflected in other 

noninterest income and expense are directly attributed to each business operating segment including fees service charges salaries and benefits and other direct revenues and costs and are respectively accounted for in a manner similar to our consolidated financial statements occupancy costs are allocated based on utilization of facilities by each business operating segment noninterest expenses incurred by centrally managed operations or business operating segments that directly support another business operating segment’s operations are charged to the applicable business operating segment based on its utilization of those services 

income taxes are assessed to each business operating segment at a standard tax rate with the residual tax expense or benefit to arrive at the consolidated effective tax rate included in other 

developing and applying methodologies used to allocate items among the business operating segments is a dynamic process accordingly financial results may be revised periodically as management systems are enhanced methods of evaluating performance or product lines are updated or our organizational structure changes

net interest income of 42 billion  in the year ended 2017  increased 415 million  or 11  compared to 38 billion  in the year ended 2016  reflecting 6  average loan growth and a 16  basis point improvement in net interest margin 

average interestearning assets of 1375 billion  increased 69 billion  or 5  from the year ended 2016  driven by a 30 billion  increase in average commercial loans and leases a 29 billion  increase in average retail loans and a 928 million  increase in average investments and interestbearing cash and due from banks and deposits in banks commercial loan growth was driven by strength in commercial and commercial real estate retail loan growth was driven by strength in residential mortgages education and other retail balances 

average deposits of 1119 billion  increased 64 billion  from the year ended 2016  reflecting growth in all categories with particular strength in checking with interest and term deposits total interestbearing deposit costs of 441 million  increased 171  or 63  from 270 million  in 2016  primarily due to the impact of rising rates and a slight shift in mix toward commercial deposits 

average total borrowed funds of 156 billion  increased 10 billion  from the year ended 2016  reflecting an increase in average longterm borrowed funds driven by issuances of senior notes total borrowed funds costs of 306 million  increased 68 million  from the year ended 2016  the total borrowed funds yield of 196  in the year ended 2017  increased 34  basis points from 162  in the year ended 2016  due to an increase in longterm rates and a mix shift to longterm senior debt 

net interest margin of 302  increased 16  basis points compared to 286  in the year ended 2016  driven by improved loan yields reflecting both higher interest rates and balance sheet optimization initiatives these results were partially offset by the impact of investment portfolio growth and higher deposit cost and funding costs average interestearning asset yields of 356  increased 31  basis points from 325  in the year ended 2016  while average interestbearing liability costs of 075  increased 20  basis points from 055  in the year ended 2016

noninterest income 

the following table presents the significant components of our noninterest income 



1  in first quarter 2017 certain prior period noninterest income amounts reported in the consolidated statement of operations were reclassified to enhance transparency and provide additional granularity particularly with regard to fee income related to customer activity these changes had no effect on net income as previously reported 

noninterest income of 15 billion  in 2017  increased 37 million  or 2  compared to 2016  driven by capital market fees card fees trust and investment service fees letter of credit and loan fees and foreign exchange and interest rate products partially offset by a reduction in service charges and fees securities gains mortgage banking fees and other income capital market fees increased 58 million  reflecting underlying business momentum and the impact of building capabilities card fees increased 30 million  from 2016  results service charges decreased 6 million  and mortgage banking fees decreased 4 million  from 2016  on an adjustedunderlying basis noninterest income increased 98 million or 7 compared to 2016  

provision for credit losses 

provision for credit losses of 321 million  decreased 48 million or 13 from 369 million  in 2016 the 48 million decrease was primarily due to continued asset quality improvement and the decline in net chargeoffs when compared to 2016  the 2017  results reflected a 16 million reserve build compared to a 34 million reserve build for the full year 2016  net chargeoffs for the full year 2017  of 305 million  were 30 million lower compared to the full year 2016  

the provision for loan and lease losses is the result of a detailed analysis performed to estimate an appropriate and adequate alll the total provision for credit losses includes the provision for loan and lease losses as well as the provision for unfunded commitments refer to “—analysis of financial condition — allowance for credit losses and nonperforming assets” for more information

noninterest expense of 35 billion  in 2017  increased 122 million  or 4  compared to 2016  salaries and benefits increased 52 million  or 3  driven by merit increases and the impact of hiring associated with strategic growth initiatives outside services increased 27 million  or 7  tied to consumer strategic growth initiatives and technology initiatives occupancy expense increased 12 million  or 4  reflecting costs associated with our branch

income tax expense 

income tax expense was 260 million  and 489 million  in 2017  and 2016  respectively this resulted in an effective tax rate of 136  and 319  in 2017  and 2016  respectively the decrease in the effective income tax rate from 2016  to 2017  was primarily attributable to the revaluation of our deferred tax liability as a result of 2017 tax legislation 

at december 31 2017  we reported a net deferred tax liability of 571 million  compared to a 714 million  liability at december 31 2016  the decrease in the net deferred tax liability was primarily attributable to the revaluation of our deferred tax liability as a result of 2017 tax legislation 

on december 22 2017 president trump signed the 2017 tax legislation which included a reduction in the corporate tax rate from 35 to 21 for citizens this required a revaluation of our net deferred tax liability with a corresponding adjustment to current tax expense and resulted in a 331 million net tax benefit included in this net tax benefit was 145 million of expense related to the revaluation of our deferred tax assets associated with unrealized losses in aoci fasb standards inplace at december 31 2017 required us to revalue all deferred taxes including those related to balances in aoci through current tax expense as a result our unrealized loss balance in aoci was not revalued to reflect the new corporate tax rate this impact commonly referred to as the “stranded tax effect” was taken under consideration by fasb in january 2018 to address concerns primarily raised by banking institutions including distortion of net income and regulatory capital in february 2018 to address the “stranded tax effect” fasb issued asu 201802 income statementreporting comprehensive income topic 220 reclassification of certain tax effects from accumulated other comprehensive income  which provides entities the election to reclassify the difference between the new and old corporate tax rates resulting from the 2017 tax legislation between retained earnings and aoci for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2018 with early adoption permitted we have retrospectively adopted asu 201802 elected to reclassify 145 million between aoci and retained earnings including indirect impacts from the decreased federal tax effect on future state tax benefits and reflected this reclassification in our 2017 consolidated financial statements included in this report

potential problem loans and leases 

at december 31 2018  we did not identify any potential problem loans or leases within the portfolio that were not already included in “—risk elements” potential problem loans or leases consist of loans and leases where information about a borrower’s possible credit problems cause management to have serious doubts as to the ability of such borrowers to comply with the present repayment terms 

commercial loan asset quality 

our commercial loan and lease portfolio consists of traditional commercial loans commercial leases and commercial real estate loans the portfolio is predominantly focused on customers in our footprint and adjacent states in which we have a physical presence where our local delivery model provides for strong client connectivity additionally we also do business in certain specialized industry sectors on a national basis 

citizens financial group inc 

management’s discussion and analysis 

for commercial loans and leases we utilize regulatory classification ratings to monitor credit quality loans with a “pass” rating are those that we believe will be fully repaid in accordance with the contractual loan terms commercial loans and leases that are “criticized” are those that have some weakness or potential weakness that indicate an increased probability of future loss “criticized” loans are grouped into three categories “special mention” “substandard” and “doubtful” special mention loans have potential weaknesses that if left uncorrected may result in deterioration of our credit position at some future date substandard loans are inadequately protected loans these loans have welldefined weaknesses that could hinder normal repayment or collection of the debt doubtful loans have the same weaknesses as substandard with the added characteristics that the possibility of loss is high and collection of the full amount of the loan is improbable these credit quality indicators for commercial loans are continually updated and monitored see note 5 “allowance for credit losses nonperforming assets and concentrations of credit risk” to our consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 — financial statements and supplementary data of this report 

nonperforming commercial loans and leases decreased   64 million  to 201 million  as of december 31 2018  from 265 million  as of december 31 2017  largely tied to a reduction in nonperforming commoditiesrelated credits as of december 31 2018  total commercial nonperforming loans were 04  of the commercial loan portfolio compared to 05  as of december 31 2017  total 2018  commercial loan and lease portfolio net chargeoffs of 33 million  remained stable with 35 million in 2017

retail loan asset quality 

for retail loans we primarily utilize payment and delinquency status to regularly review and monitor credit quality trends historical experience indicates that the longer a loan is past due the greater the likelihood of future credit loss the largest portion of the retail portfolio is represented by borrowers located in the new england midatlantic and midwest regions although we have continued to grow selectively in areas outside the footprint primarily in the auto finance education lending and unsecured portfolios 

citizens financial group inc 

management’s discussion and analysis 

the following tables present asset quality metrics for the retail loan portfolio 



1  the real estate secured portfolio cltv is calculated as the mortgage and second lien loan balance divided by the most recently available value of the property 



retail asset quality remains stable with a net chargeoff rate of 048  for the year ended december 31 2018  an increase of one  basis point from the year ended december 31 2017  driven by growth in credit cards as well as continued expected seasoning in our personal loan and education refinance loan portfolios 

heloc payment shock 

payment shock in the heloc portfolio occurs when the 10year interest only draw period ends and the payment converts to a fully amortizing principal and interest payment we monitor the risk associated with the payment increase and have a comprehensive program designed to provide heightened customer outreach to inform educate and assist customers through the reset process as well as to offer alternative financing and forbearance options results of this program indicate that our efforts to assist customers at risk of default have successfully reduced delinquency and chargeoff rates compared to our original expectations 

the table below outlines the population expected to mature between january 1 2019 and december 31 2021 compared to the overall heloc population reflecting a similar credit profile for each population 



the performance of our historical vintages that have entered repayment remains stable the following table presents the asset quality metrics as of december 31 2018  for the helocs reset at each year ending 



factors that affect our future expectations for continued relatively low chargeoff risk in the face of rising interest rates for the portion of our heloc portfolio subject to reset in future periods include a relatively high level of first lien collateral positions improved loantovalue ratios resulting from continued home price appreciation relatively stable portfolio credit score profiles and continued robust loss mitigation efforts 

troubled debt restructurings 

tdr is the classification given to a loan that has been restructured in a manner that grants a concession to a borrower experiencing financial hardship that we would not otherwise make tdrs typically result from our loss mitigation efforts and are undertaken in order to improve the likelihood of recovery and continuity of the relationship our loan modifications are handled on a casebycase basis and are negotiated to achieve mutually agreeable terms that maximize loan collectability and meet our borrower’s financial needs the types of concessions include interest rate reductions term extensions principal forgiveness and other modifications to the structure of the loan that fall outside our lending policy depending on the specific facts and circumstances of the customer restructuring can involve loans moving to nonaccrual remaining on nonaccrual or remaining on accrual status 

citizens financial group inc 

management’s discussion and analysis 

as of december 31 2018  723 million  of retail loans were classified as tdrs compared with 761 million  as of december 31 2017  the decrease was in part attributable to both loan repayments and the increasing amortization of balances as more seasoned accounts age as of december 31 2018  181 million of retail tdrs were in nonaccrual status with 49 current on payments stable compared with 211 million in nonaccrual status with 51 current on payments at december 31 2017  tdrs generally return to accrual status once repayment capacity and appropriate payment history can be established tdrs are individually evaluated for impairment and loans once classified as tdrs remain classified as tdrs until paid off sold or refinanced at market terms 

for additional information regarding tdrs see “—critical accounting estimates — allowance for credit losses” and note 5 “allowance for credit losses nonperforming assets and concentrations of credit risk” to our consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 — financial statements and supplementary data of this report

capital and regulatory matters 

as a bank holding company and a financial holding company we are subject to regulation and supervision by the frb as of december 31 2018 our primary subsidiaries were cbna a national banking association whose primary federal regulator is the occ and cbpa a pennsylvaniachartered savings bank regulated by the department of banking of the commonwealth of pennsylvania and supervised by the fdic as its primary federal regulator on january 2 2019 we consolidated our banking subsidiaries via a merger of cbpa into cbna in order to streamline governance and enterprise risk management improve cbna’s risk profile and gain operational efficiencies cbna is now our primary subsidiary and our sole banking subsidiary 

our regulation and supervision continues to evolve as the legal and regulatory frameworks governing our operations continue to change the current operating environment reflects heightened regulatory expectations around many regulations including consumer compliance the bank secrecy act antimoney laundering compliance and increased internal audit activities for more information see “regulation and supervision” in part i item 1 — business included in this report 

doddfrank act and economic growth regulatory relief and consumer protection act 

under the doddfrank act until the stress testing amendments of egrrcpa take effect we are required to submit our annual capital plan and the results of our annual companyrun stress tests to the frb by april 5th of each year and disclose certain results within 15 days after the frb discloses the results of its supervisoryrun tests egrrcpa amended the doddfrank act by among other things effective november 24 2019 removing the requirements for firms with between 100 billion or more but less than 250 billion such as citizens to conduct companyrun stress tests and to be subject to supervisory stress testing although the frb retains discretion to subject such firms to these requirements in light of these amendments the frb has exempted citizens from supervisory and companyrun stress testing requirements for the 2019 cycle and proposed to conduct supervisory stress tests on a biennial basis and to eliminate companyrun stress testing requirements for certain bhcs including citizens we publish estimated dfast results under the supervisory severely adverse scenario on our regulatory filings and disclosures page on our investor relations website at httpinvestorcitizensbankcom on april 5 2018 we submitted our 2018 capital plan capital policy and annual stress test results to the frb as part of the 2018 ccar process on june 28 2018 the frb announced that it did not object to our 2018 capital plan including our proposed capital actions for the period beginning july 1 2018 and ending june 30 2019 our 2018 capital plan includes quarterly common dividends of 027 per share in third and fourth quarter 2018 increasing to 032 per share in first and second quarter 2019 and common share repurchases of up to 102 billion through second quarter 2019 while the regulatory landscape of capital planning and stress testing continues to evolve we maintain a robust inventory of potential actions that could be taken to restore capital liquidity or both in the event of market or idiosyncratic financial stress we continue to comply with all regulatory requirements for capital planning and stress testing as well as internal policy governing capital actions 

the doddfrank act also required our bank subsidiary to conduct stress tests on an annual basis and to disclose the stress test results under egrrcpa effective november 2019 banks with total consolidated assets between 100 billion and 250 billion such as cbna will not be required to conduct annual companyrun stress tests in december 2018 the occ proposed to implement this change and if enacted as proposed we believe that cbna will not be required to conduct its annual companyrun stress tests during 2019 cbna submitted its 2018 annual stress tests to the occ on april 5 2018 and published on our investor relations website referenced above a summary of those results along with the stress test results of the parent company on june 21 2018 

similarly we are required to submit the results of our midcycle companyrun dfast stress tests by october 5 th  of each year to the frb and disclose the summary results of our internally developed stress tests under the internally developed severely adverse scenario between october 5 th  and november 4 th  we submitted the results of our 2018 midcycle stress test to the frb and disclosed a summary of the results on october 5 2018 we publish these companyrun estimated impacts of stress on our investor relations website referenced above the frb has proposed to eliminate midcycle companyrun dfast stress tests effective with the 2020 capital planning and stress testing cycle and as with the other capital planning and stress testing requirements for the 2019 cycle has exempted citizens from this requirement for the 2019 cycle

1 “common equity tier 1 capital ratio” is cet1 capital divided by total riskweighted assets as defined under us basel iii standardized approach 

2 “tier 1 capital ratio” is tier 1 capital which includes cet1 capital plus noncumulative perpetual preferred equity that qualifies as additional tier 1 capital divided by total riskweighted assets as defined under us basel iii standardized approach 

3 “total capital ratio” is total capital divided by total riskweighted assets as defined under us basel iii standardized approach 

4  “tier 1 leverage ratio” is tier 1 capital divided by quarterly average total assets as defined under us basel iii standardized approach

6  “minimum capital ratio” includes capital conservation buffer for transitional basel iii of 1875  for 2018  and 1250  for 2017  na to tier 1 leverage 

at december 31 2018  our cet1 capital tier 1 capital and total capital ratios were 106  113  and 133  respectively as compared with 112  114  and 139  respectively as of december 31 2017  the cet1 capital ratio decreased as 85 billion of riskweighted asset growth including 15 billion from famc goodwill and intangible growth attributable to the famc acquisition and capital plan actions that included common dividends of 471 million  preferred dividends of 29 million  and repurchase of 1025 billion of our outstanding common stock were partially offset by net income for the year ended december 31 2018 the tier 1 capital ratio decreased due to the changes in cet1 capital ratio partially offset by the issuance of preferred stock the total capital ratio decreased due to the changes in cet1 and tier 1 capital ratios as well as the june 2018 redemption of subordinated debt and an increase in nonqualifying subordinated debt at december 31 2018  our cet1 capital tier 1 capital and total capital ratios were approximately 363  basis points 275  basis points and 283  basis points respectively above their regulatory minima plus the fully phasedin capital conservation buffer all ratios remained well above the us basel iii minima 

regulatory capital ratios and capital composition 

cet1 capital under us basel iii standardized rules totaled 145 billion  at december 31 2018  and increased   176 million  from 143 billion  at december 31 2017  as net income for the year ended december 31 2018 was partially offset by the impact of common share repurchases dividends and an increase in goodwill and intangibles related to the famc acquisition tier 1 capital at december 31 2018  totaled 153 billion  reflecting a 769 million   increase  from 146 billion  at december 31 2017  driven by the changes in cet1 capital and the issuance of preferred stock at december 31 2018 we had 840 million of fixedtofloating noncumulative perpetual preferred stock issued and outstanding an increase of 593 million from 247 million at december 31 2017 the increase is attributable to the second quarter 2018 issuance of 300000 shares of series b preferred stock and the fourth quarter 2018 issuance of 300000 shares of series c preferred stock both of which qualified as additional tier 1 capital total capital of 182 billion  at december 31 2018  increased   376 million  from december 31 2017  driven by the changes in cet1 and tier 1 capital partially offset by the june 2018 redemption of subordinated debt and an increase in nonqualifying subordinated debt

management’s discussion and analysis 

riskweighted assets “rwa” totaled 1362 billion  at december 31 2018  based on us basel iii standardized rules up   85 billion  from december 31 2017  this increase was driven by growth in commercial loans and commitments as well as growth in retail loans including residential mortgages education and unsecured retail portfolios the increase in rwa was also driven by the acquisition of famc mortgage servicing rights these increases were partially offset by runoff in the auto and home equity portfolios 

as of december 31 2018  the tier 1 leverage ratio was 100  and was stable with december 31 2017  as the 74 billion increase in quarterly adjusted average assets was offset by the increase in tier 1 capital 

the following table presents our capital composition under the us basel iii capital framework

2  as of december 31 2018  and 2017  the amount of nonqualifying subordinated debt excluded from regulatory capital was 139 million and 70 million respectively 

capital adequacy process 

our assessment of capital adequacy begins with our risk appetite and risk management framework this framework provides for the identification measurement and management of material risks capital requirements are determined for actual and forecasted risk portfolios using applicable regulatory capital methodologies the assessment also considers the possible impacts of approved and proposed changes to regulatory capital requirements key analytical frameworks including stress testing which enable the assessment of capital adequacy versus unexpected loss under a variety of stress scenarios supplement our base line forecast a governance framework supports our capital planning process including capital management policies and procedures that document capital adequacy metrics and limits as well as our capital contingency plan and the active engagement of both the legalentity boards and senior management in oversight and decisionmaking   

forwardlooking assessments of capital adequacy feed development of a single capital plan covering us and our banking subsidiary that is periodically submitted to the frb we prepare this plan in full compliance with the frb’s capital plan rule and we participate annually in the frb’s horizontal capital review which is the frb’s assessment of specific capital planning areas as part of their normal supervisory process 

all distributions proposed under our capital plan are subject to consideration and approval by our board of directors prior to execution the timing and exact amount of future dividends and share repurchases will depend on various factors including our capital position financial performance and market conditions

5  on january 2 2019 we consolidated our banking subsidiaries via a merger of cbpa into cbna 

cbna cet1 capital totaled 120 billion  at december 31 2018  up   77 million  from 119 billion  at december 31 2017  reflecting net income for the year ended december 31 2018 partially offset by dividend payments and an increase in goodwill and intangibles related to the famc acquisition at december 31 2018  cbna held minimal additional tier 1 capital total capital was 143 billion  at december 31 2018  an increase  of 125 million  from december 31 2017  driven by the increase in cet1 capital and an increase in the acl 

cbna had rwa of 1136 billion  at december 31 2018  an increase  of 88 billion  from december 31 2017  driven by growth in commercial loans and commitments as well as growth in retail loans including residential

mortgages education and unsecured retail portfolios the increase in rwa was also driven by famc which resulted in higher mortgage servicing rights these increases were partially offset by runoff in the auto and home equity portfolios 

as of december 31 2018  the cbna tier 1 leverage ratio decreased 48 basis points to 99  from 103  as of december 31 2017  primarily driven by a 64 billion increase in quarterly adjusted average assets that drove a 54 basis point decline in the ratio 

cbpa cet1 capital totaled 30 billion  at december 31 2018  a decrease  of 19 million  at december 31 2017  as dividend payments exceeded net income total capital was 32 billion  at december 31 2018  a decrease  of 58 million  from december 31 2017  driven by the decrease in cet1 capital and a decrease in the acl 

cbpa had rwa of 229 billion  at december 31 2018  a decrease  of 737 million  from december 31 2017  driven by decreases in the auto education residential mortgage and home equity portfolios these decreases were partially offset by an increase in commercial loans 

as of december 31 2018  the cbpa tier 1 leverage ratio was 90  an increase of 30 basis points from   december 31 2017  primarily driven by a 14 billion decrease in quarterly adjusted average assets that drove a 35 basis point increase in the ratio 

liquidity 

liquidity is defined as our ability to meet our cashflow and collateral obligations in a timely manner at a reasonable cost an institution must maintain operating liquidity to meet its expected daily and forecasted cashflow requirements as well as contingent liquidity to meet unexpected stress scenario funding requirements as noted earlier reflecting the importance of meeting all unexpected and stressscenario funding requirements we identify and manage contingent liquidity consisting of cash balances at the frb unencumbered highquality and liquid securities and unused fhlb borrowing capacity separately we also identify and manage asset liquidity as a subset of contingent liquidity consisting of cash balances at the frb and unencumbered highquality securities we consider the effective and prudent management of liquidity to be fundamental to our health and strength 

we manage liquidity at the consolidated enterprise level and at each material legal entity including at the parent company and cbna 

parent company liquidity 

our parent company’s primary sources of cash are i dividends and interest received from cbna as a result of investing in bank equity and subordinated debt and ii externally issued preferred stock and senior and subordinated debt uses of cash include the following i routine cash flow requirements as a bank holding company including periodic share repurchases and payments of dividends interest and expenses ii needs of subsidiaries including cbna for additional equity and as required its need for debt financing and iii support for extraordinary funding requirements when necessary to the extent that the parent company has relied on wholesale borrowings uses also include payments of related principal and interest 

on january 29 2019 the parent company issued 300 million  or 12000000  depositary shares each representing a 140th interest in a share of its 6350  fixedtofloating rate noncumulative perpetual series d preferred stock par value of 2500 per share with a liquidation preference of 1000 per share equivalent to 25  per depositary share for further discussion see note 16 “stockholders’ equity” to our consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 — financial statements and supplementary data of this report 

for further information on outstanding debt and preferred stock see note 12 “borrowed funds” and note 16 “stockholders’ equity” to our consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 — financial statements and supplementary data of this report 

during the years ended december 31 2018   and 2017  the parent company declared and paid dividends on common stock of 471 million  and 322 million  respectively and declared dividends on preferred stock of 29 million  and 14 million  respectively during the years ended december 31 2018  and 2017  the parent company repurchased 1025 billion  and 820 million  of its outstanding common stock respectively 

our parent company’s cash and cash equivalents represent a source of liquidity that can be used to meet various needs and totaled 911 million  as of december 31 2018  compared with 443 million  as of december 31 2017  the parent company’s doubleleverage ratio the combined equity investment in parent company subsidiaries 

citizens financial group inc 

management’s discussion and analysis 

divided by parent company equity is a measure of reliance on equity cash flows from subsidiaries to fund parent company obligations at december 31 2018  the parent company’s doubleleverage ratio was 99  

cbna liquidity 

in the ordinary course of business the liquidity of cbna is managed by matching sources and uses of cash the primary sources of bank liquidity include i deposits from our consumer and commercial customers ii payments of principal and interest on loans and debt securities and iii wholesale borrowings as needed and as described under “—liquidity risk management and governance” the primary uses of bank liquidity include i withdrawals and maturities of deposits ii payment of interest on deposits iii funding of loans and related commitments and iv funding of securities purchases to the extent that cbna has relied on wholesale borrowings uses also include payments of related principal and interest for further information on cbna’s outstanding debt see note 12 “borrowed funds” to our consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 —   financial statements and supplementary data of this report 

cbna’s major businesses involve taking deposits and making loans hence a key role of liquidity management is to ensure that customers have timely access to funds from deposits and loans liquidity management also involves maintaining sufficient liquidity to repay wholesale borrowings pay operating expenses and support extraordinary funding requirements when necessary 

on february 14 2019 cbna issued 15 billion in senior notes consisting of 700 million in threeyear fixedrate notes 300 million in threeyear floatingrate notes and 500 million in sevenyear fixedrate notes 

liquidity risk 

we define liquidity risk as the risk that an entity will be unable to meet its payment obligations in a timely manner at a reasonable cost liquidity risk can arise due to contingent liquidity risk andor funding liquidity risk 

contingent liquidity risk is the risk that market conditions may reduce an entity’s ability to liquidate pledge andor finance certain assets and thereby substantially reduce the liquidity value of such assets drivers of contingent liquidity risk include general market disruptions as well as specific issues regarding the credit quality andor valuation of a security or loan issuer or borrower andor asset class 

funding liquidity risk is the risk that market conditions andor entityspecific events may reduce an entity’s ability to raise funds from depositors andor wholesale market counterparties drivers of funding liquidity risk may be idiosyncratic or systemic reflecting impediments to operations andor damaged market confidence 

factors affecting liquidity 

given the composition of its assets and borrowing sources contingent liquidity risk at cbna would be materially affected by such events as deterioration of financing markets for highquality securities eg mortgagebacked securities and other instruments issued by the gnma fnma and the fhlmc by any inability of the fhlbs to provide collateralized advances andor by a refusal of the frb to act as lender of last resort in systemic stress 

similarly given the structure of its balance sheet the funding liquidity risk of cbna would be materially affected by an adverse idiosyncratic event eg a major loss causing a perceived or actual deterioration in its financial condition an adverse systemic event eg default or bankruptcy of a significant capital markets participant or a combination of both eg the financial crisis of 20082010 however during the financial crisis cbna reduced its dependence on unsecured wholesale funding to virtually zero consequently and despite ongoing exposure to a variety of idiosyncratic and systemic events we view our contingent liquidity risk and our funding liquidity risk to be relatively modest 

citizens financial group inc 

management’s discussion and analysis 

an additional variable affecting our access and the access of cbna to unsecured wholesale market funds and to large denomination ie uninsured customer deposits is the credit ratings assigned by such agencies as moody’s standard  poor’s and fitch the following table presents our credit ratings 



nr  not rated 

changes in our public credit ratings could affect both the cost and availability of our wholesale funding as a result and in order to maintain a conservative funding profile cbna continues to minimize reliance on unsecured wholesale funding at december 31 2018  our wholesale funding consisted primarily of secured borrowings from the fhlbs collateralized by highquality residential mortgages and term debt issued by the parent company and cbna 

the frb and the occ regularly evaluate our liquidity as part of the overall supervisory process in addition we are subject to existing and evolving regulatory liquidity requirements some of which are subject to further rulemaking guidance and interpretation by the applicable federal regulators for further discussion see “regulation and supervision — financial regulatory reform” and “—liquidity requirements” in part i item 1 — business included in this report 

liquidity risk management and governance 

liquidity risk is measured and managed by the funding and liquidity unit within our treasury unit in accordance with policy guidelines promulgated by our board and the asset liability committee in managing liquidity risk the funding and liquidity unit delivers regular and comprehensive reporting including current levels versus threshold limits for a broad set of liquidity metrics and early warning indicators explanatory commentary relating to emerging risk trends and as appropriate recommended remedial strategies 

the mission of our funding and liquidity unit is to deliver and otherwise maintain prudent levels of operating liquidity to support expected and projected funding requirements and contingent liquidity to support unexpected funding requirements resulting from idiosyncratic systemic and combination stress events and regulatory liquidity requirements additionally we will deliver this liquidity from stable funding sources in a timely manner and at a reasonable cost without significant adverse consequences 

we seek to accomplish this mission by funding loans with stable deposits by prudently controlling dependence on wholesale funding particularly shortterm unsecured funding and by maintaining ample available liquidity including a contingent liquidity buffer of unencumbered highquality loans and securities as of december 31 2018  



citizens financial group inc 

management’s discussion and analysis 

the funding and liquidity unit monitors a variety of liquidity and funding metrics and early warning indicators and metrics including specific risk thresholds limits these monitoring tools are broadly classified as follows 

 further certain of these metrics are monitored individually for cbna and for our consolidated enterprise on a daily basis including cash position unencumbered securities asset liquidity and available fhlb borrowing capacity in order to identify emerging trends and risks and inform funding decisions specific metrics are also forecasted over a oneyear horizon

critical accounting estimates 

our audited consolidated financial statements which are included in this report are prepared in accordance with gaap the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to establish accounting policies and make estimates that affect amounts reported in our audited consolidated financial statements 

an accounting estimate requires assumptions and judgments about uncertain matters that could have a material effect on our audited consolidated financial statements estimates are made using facts and circumstances known at a point in time changes in those facts and circumstances could produce results substantially different from those estimates the most significant accounting policies and estimates and their related application are discussed below 

see note 1 “basis of presentation” to our consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 — financial statements and supplementary data of this report for further discussion of our significant accounting policies 

allowance for credit losses 

management’s estimate of probable losses in our loan and lease portfolios including unfunded lending commitments is recorded in the alll and the reserve for unfunded lending commitments at levels that we believe to be appropriate as of the balance sheet date the reserve for unfunded lending commitments is reported as a component of other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets our determination of such estimates is based on a periodic evaluation of the loan and lease portfolios and unfunded credit facilities as well as other relevant factors this evaluation is inherently subjective and requires significant estimates and judgments of underlying factors all of which are susceptible to change

the alll and reserve for unfunded lending commitments could be affected by a variety of internal and external factors internal factors include portfolio performance such as delinquency levels assigned risk ratings the mix and level of loan balances differing economic risks associated with each loan category and the financial condition of specific borrowers external factors include fluctuations in the general economy unemployment rates bankruptcy filings developments within a particular industry changes in collateral values and factors particular to a specific commercial credit such as competition business and management performance the alll may be adjusted to reflect our current assessment of various qualitative risks factors and events that may not be measured in our statistical procedures there is no certainty that the alll and reserve for unfunded lending commitments will be appropriate over time to cover losses because of unanticipated adverse changes in any of these internal external or qualitative factors there were no material changes in assumptions or estimation techniques compared with prior years that impacted the determination of the current year’s alll and the reserve for unfunded lending commitments 

the evaluation of the adequacy of the commercial commercial real estate and lease alll and reserve for unfunded lending commitments is primarily based on risk rating models that assess probability of default “pd” loss given default “lgd” and exposure at default on an individual loan basis the models are primarily driven by individual customer financial characteristics and are validated against historical experience additionally qualitative factors are included in the risk rating models after the aggregation of individual borrower incurred loss additional overlays can be made based on backtesting against historical losses and forward loss curve ratios 

for nonaccruing commercial and commercial real estate loans with an outstanding balance of 3 million or greater and for all commercial and commercial real estate tdrs regardless of size we conduct specific analysis on a loan level basis to determine the probable amount of credit loss if appropriate a specific alll is established for the loan through a charge to the provision for credit losses for all classes of impaired loans individual loan measures of impairment may result in a chargeoff to the alll if deemed appropriate in such cases the provision for credit losses is not affected when a specific reserve for at least that amount already exists techniques utilized include comparing the loan’s carrying amount to the estimated present value of its future cash flows the fair value of its underlying collateral or the loan’s observable market price the technique applied to each impaired loan is based on the workout officer’s opinion of the most probable workout scenario historically this has generally led to the use of the estimated present value of future cash flows approach the fair value of underlying collateral will be used if the loan is deemed collateral dependent for loans that use the fair value of underlying collateral approach a chargeoff assessment is performed quarterly to write the loans down for declines in value to fair value less cost to sell 

for most nonimpaired retail loan portfolio types the alll is based upon the incurred loss model utilizing the pd lgd and exposure at default on an individual loan basis when developing these factors we may consider the loan product and collateral type delinquency status ltv ratio lien position borrower’s credit time outstanding geographic location and incurred loss period incurred loss periods are reviewed and updated at least annually and potentially more frequently when economic situations change rapidly as they tend to fluctuate with economic cycles incurred loss periods are generally longer in good economic times and shorter in bad times certain retail portfolios including education unsecured personal loans sbo home equity loans and credit card receivables utilize roll rate or vintage models to estimate the alll 

for home equity lines and loans a number of factors impact the pd specifically the borrower’s current fico score the utilization rate delinquency statistics borrower income current cltv ratio and months on books are all used to assess the borrower’s creditworthiness similarly lgd is also impacted by various factors including the utilization rate the cltv ratio the lien position the housing price index change for the location as measured by the caseshiller index age of the loan and current loan balance 

when we are not in a first lien position we use delinquency information on the first lien exposures obtained from thirdparty credit information providers in the credit assessment for all first liens whether owned by a third party or by us an additional assessment is performed on a quarterly basis in this assessment the most recent three months’ performance of the senior liens is reviewed for delinquency 90 days or more past due modification foreclosure andor bankruptcy statuses if any derogatory status is present the junior lien will be placed on nonaccrual status regardless of its delinquency status on our books this subsequent change to nonaccrual status will alter the treatment in the pd model thus affecting the reserve calculation 

in addition the first lien exposure is combined with the second lien exposure to generate a cltv the cltv is a more accurate reflection of the leverage of the borrower against the property value as compared to the ltv from just the junior liens the cltv is used for modeling both the junior lien pd and lgd this also impacts the alll rates for the junior lien helocs 

citizens financial group inc 

management’s discussion and analysis 

the above measures are all used to assess the pd and lgd for heloc borrowers for whom we originated the loans 

for retail tdrs that are not collateraldependent allowances are developed using the present value of expected future cash flows compared to the recorded investment in the loans expected redefault factors are considered in this analysis retail tdrs that are deemed collateraldependent are written down to the fair market value of the collateral less costs to sell the fair value of collateral is periodically monitored subsequent to the modification 

changes in the levels of estimated losses can significantly affect management’s determination of an appropriate alll for retail loans losses are affected by such factors as loss severity collateral values economic conditions and other factors a one basis point and five basis point increase in the estimated loss rate for retail loans at december 31 2018  would have increased the alll by 6 million and 30 million respectively the alll for our commercial banking segment is sensitive to assigned credit risk ratings and inherent loss rates if 10 and 20 of the december 31 2018  year end loan balances including unfunded commitments within each risk rating category of our commercial banking segment had experienced downgrades of two risk categories the alll would have increased by 99 million and 194 million respectively 

commercial loans and leases are charged off to the alll when there is little prospect of collecting either principal or interest chargeoffs of commercial loans and leases usually involve receipt of borrowerspecific adverse information for commercial collateraldependent loans an appraisal or other valuation is used to quantify a shortfall between the fair value of the collateral less costs to sell and the recorded investment in the commercial loan retail loan chargeoffs are generally based on established delinquency thresholds rather than borrowerspecific adverse information when a loan is collateraldependent any shortfalls between the fair value of the collateral less costs to sell and the recorded investment is promptly charged off placing any loan or lease on nonaccrual status does not by itself require a partial or total chargeoff however any identified losses are charged off at that time

fair value 

we measure fair value using the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date fair value is based upon quoted market prices in an active market where available if quoted prices are not available observable marketbased inputs or independently sourced parameters are used to develop fair value whenever possible such inputs may include prices of similar assets or liabilities yield curves interest rates prepayment speeds and foreign exchange rates 

we classify our assets and liabilities that are carried at fair value in accordance with the threelevel valuation hierarchy 

 classification in the hierarchy is based upon the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement of the asset or liability for instruments classified in level 1 and 2 where inputs are primarily based upon observable market data there is less judgment applied in arriving at the fair value for instruments classified in level 3 management judgment is more significant due to the lack of observable market data 

we review and update the fair value hierarchy classifications on a quarterly basis changes from one quarter to the next related to the observability of inputs in fair value measurements may result in a reclassification between the fair value hierarchy levels and are recognized based on yearend balances we also verify the accuracy of the pricing provided by our primary external pricing service on a quarterly basis this process involves using a secondary external vendor to provide valuations for our securities portfolio for comparison purposes any securities with discrepancies beyond a certain threshold are researched and if necessary valued by an independent outside broker 

citizens financial group inc 

management’s discussion and analysis 

fair value is also used on a nonrecurring basis to evaluate certain assets for impairment or for disclosure purposes examples of nonrecurring uses of fair value include mortgage servicing rights accounted for by the amortization method loan impairments for certain loans and goodwill 

the fair value of assets under operating leases is determined using collateral specific pricing digests external appraisals broker opinions recent sales data from industry equipment dealers and the discounted cash flows derived from the underlying lease agreement as market data for similar assets and lease agreements is available and used in the valuation these assets are classified as level 2 

msrs do not trade in an active market with readily observable prices msrs are classified as level 3 since the valuation methodology utilizes significant unobservable inputs the fair value was calculated using a discounted cash flow model which used assumptions including weightedaverage life prepayment assumptions and weightedaverage option adjusted spread it is important to note that changes in our assumptions may not be independent of each other changes in one assumption may result in changes to another eg changes in interest rates which are inversely correlated to changes in prepayment rates may result in changes to discount rates which could impact sensitivities the underlying assumptions and estimated values are corroborated by values received from independent third parties based on their review of the servicing portfolio and comparisons to market transactions in addition the msr policy is approved by the asset liability committee

risk governance 

we are committed to maintaining a strong integrated and proactive approach to the management of all risks to which we are exposed in pursuit of our business objectives a key aspect of our board’s responsibility as the main decision making body is setting our risk appetite to ensure that the levels of risk that we are willing to accept in the attainment of our strategic business and financial objectives are clearly understood   

to enable our board to carry out its objectives it has delegated authority for risk management activities as well as governance and oversight of those activities to a number of board and executive management level risk committees the executive risk committee “erc” chaired by the chief risk officer is responsible for oversight of risk across the enterprise and actively considers our inherent material risks analyzes our overall risk profile and seeks confirmation that the risks are being appropriately identified assessed and mitigated reporting to the erc are the following additional committees covering specific areas of risk compliance and operational risk committee model risk committee credit policy committee asset liability committee business initiatives review committee and the ethics oversight committee   

risk framework 

our risk management framework is embedded in our business through a “three lines of defense” model which defines responsibilities and accountabilities for risk management activities 

first line of defense 

the business lines including their associated support functions are the first line of defense and are accountable for identifying assessing managing and controlling the risks associated with the products and services they provide the business lines are responsible for performing regular risk assessments to identify and assess the material risks that arise in their area of responsibility complying with relevant risk policies testing and certifying the adequacy and effectiveness of their operational and financial reporting controls on a regular basis establishing and documenting operating procedures and establishing and owning a governance structure for identifying and managing risk 

second line of defense 

the second line of defense includes independent monitoring and control functions accountable for developing and ensuring implementation of risk and control frameworks and related policies this centralized risk function is appropriately independent from the business and is accountable for overseeing and challenging our business lines on the effective management of their risks including credit market operational regulatory reputational interest rate liquidity and strategic risks

management’s discussion and analysis 

third line of defense 

our internal audit function is the third line of defense providing independent assurance with a view of the effectiveness of citizens’ internal controls governance practices and culture so that risk is managed appropriately for the size complexity and risk profile of the organization internal audit has complete and unrestricted access to any and all bank records physical properties and personnel internal audit issues a report following each internal review and provides an audit opinion to citizens’ audit committee on a quarterly basis 

credit quality assurance reports to the chief audit executive and provides the legalentity boards senior management and other stakeholders with independent assurance on the quality of credit portfolios and adherence to agreed credit risk appetite and credit policies and processes in line with its procedures and regulatory expectations the credit quality assurance function undertakes a program of portfolio testing assessing and reporting through four risk pillars of asset quality rating and data integrity risk management and credit risk appetite 

risk appetite 

risk appetite is a strategic business and risk management tool we define our risk appetite as the maximum limit of acceptable risk beyond which we could be unable to achieve our strategic objectives and capital adequacy obligations 

our principal nonmarket risks include credit operational regulatory reputational liquidity and strategic risks we are also subject to certain market risks which include potential losses arising from changes in interest rates foreign exchange rates equity prices commodity prices andor other relevant market rates or prices market risk in our business arises from trading activities that serve customer needs including hedging of interest rates foreign exchange risk and nontrading activities within capital markets we have established enterprisewide policies and methodologies to identify measure monitor and report on market risk we actively manage both trading and nontrading market risks see “—market risk” for further information our risk appetite is reviewed and approved annually by the board risk committee 

credit risk 

overview 

credit risk represents the potential for loss arising from a customer counterparty or issuer failing to perform in accordance with the contractual terms of the obligation while the majority of our credit risk is associated with lending activities we do engage with other financial counterparties for a variety of purposes including investing asset and liability management and trading activities given the financial impact of credit risk on our earnings and balance sheet the assessment approval and management of credit risk represents a major part of our overall riskmanagement responsibility 

objective 

the independent credit risk function is responsible for reviewing and approving credit risk appetite across all lines of business and credit products approving larger and higher risk credit transactions monitoring portfolio performance identifying problem credit exposures and ensuring remedial management 

organizational structure 

management and oversight of credit risk is the responsibility of both the business line and the second line of defense the second line of defense the independent credit risk function is led by the chief credit officer who oversees all of our credit risk the chief credit officer reports to the chief risk officer the chief credit officer acting in a manner consistent with board policies has responsibility for among other things the governance process around policies procedures risk acceptance criteria credit risk appetite limits and authority delegation the chief credit officer and team also have responsibility for credit approvals for larger and higher risk transactions and oversight of line of business credit risk activities reporting to the chief credit officer are the heads of the second line of defense credit functions specializing in consumer banking commercial banking citizens restructuring management portfolio and corporate reporting alll analytics current expected credit loss and credit policy and administration each team under these leaders is composed of highly experienced credit professionals

management’s discussion and analysis 

governance 

the primary mechanisms used to govern our credit risk function are our consumer and commercial credit policies these policies outline the minimum acceptable lending standards that align with our desired risk appetite material changes in our business model and strategies that identify a need to change our risk appetite or highlight a risk not previously contemplated are identified by the individual committees and presented to the credit policy committee executive risk committee and the board risk committee for approval as appropriate 

key management processes 

we employ a comprehensive and integrated risk control program to proactively i identify ii measure iii monitor and iv mitigate existing and emerging credit risks across the credit lifecycle origination account managementportfolio management and loss mitigation and recovery 

consumer 

on the consumer banking side of credit risk our teams use models to evaluate consumer loans across the lifecycle of the loan starting at origination credit scoring models are used to forecast the probability of default of an applicant when approving customers for a new loan or extension of an existing credit line credit scores are used in conjunction with other credit risk variables such as affordability length of term collateral value collateral type and lien subordination 

to ensure proper oversight of the underwriting teams lending authority is granted by the second line of defense credit risk function to each underwriter the amount of delegated authority depends on the experience of the individual we periodically evaluate the performance of each underwriter and annually reauthorize their delegated authority only senior members of the second line of defense credit risk team are authorized to approve significant exceptions to credit policies it is not uncommon to make exceptions to established policies when compensating factors are present there are exception limits which when reached trigger a comprehensive analysis 

once an account is established credit scores and collateral values are refreshed at regular intervals to allow for proactive identification of increasing or decreasing levels of credit risk our approach to managing credit risk is highly analytical and where appropriate is automated to ensure consistency and efficiency 

commercial 

on the commercial banking side of credit risk the structure is broken into ci loans and leases and cre within ci loans and leases there are separate verticals established for certain specialty products eg assetbased lending leasing franchise finance health care and technology midcorporate a “specialty vertical” is a standalone team of industry or product specialists substantially all activity that falls under the ambit of the defined industry or product is managed through a specialty vertical when one exists cre also operates as a specialty vertical 

commercial credit risk management begins with defined credit products and policies 

commercial transactions are subject to individual analysis and approval at origination and with few exceptions are subject to a formal annual review requirement the underwriting process includes the establishment and approval of credit grades that confirm the pd and lgd all material transactions then require the approval of both a business line approver and an independent credit approver with the requisite level of delegated authority the approval level of a particular credit facility is determined by the size of the credit relationship as well as the pd the checks and balances in the credit process and the independence of the credit approver function are designed to appropriately assess and sanction the level of credit risk being accepted facilitate the early recognition of credit problems when they occur and to provide for effective problem asset management and resolution all authority to grant credit is delegated through the independent credit risk function and is closely monitored and regularly updated 

the primary factors considered in commercial credit approvals are the financial strength of the borrower assessment of the borrower’s management capabilities cash flows from operations industry sector trends type and sufficiency of collateral type of exposure transaction structure and the general economic outlook while these are the primary factors considered there are a number of other factors that may be considered in the decision process in addition to the credit analysis conducted during the approval process at origination and annual review our credit quality assurance group performs testing to provide an independent review and assessment of the quality of the portfolio and new originations this group conducts portfolio reviews on a riskbased cycle to evaluate individual loans and validate risk ratings as well as test the consistency of the credit processes and the effectiveness of credit risk management 

citizens financial group inc 

management’s discussion and analysis 

the maximum level of credit exposure to individual credit borrowers is limited by policy guidelines based on the perceived risk of each borrower or related group of borrowers concentration risk is managed through limits on industry asset class and loan quality factors we focus predominantly on extending credit to commercial customers with existing or expandable relationships within our primary markets for this purpose defined as our 11 state footprint plus contiguous states although we do engage in lending opportunities outside our primary markets if we believe that the associated risks are acceptable and aligned with strategic initiatives 

substantially all loans categorized as classified are managed by a specialized group of credit professionals 

market risk 

market risk refers to potential losses arising from changes in interest rates foreign exchange rates equity prices commodity prices andor other relevant market rates or prices modest market risk arises from trading activities that serve customer needs including hedging of interest rate and foreign exchange risk as described below more material market risk arises from our nontrading banking activities such as loan origination and depositgathering we have established enterprisewide policies and methodologies to identify measure monitor and report market risk we actively manage both trading and nontrading market risks 

nontrading risk 

we are exposed to market risk as a result of nontrading banking activities this market risk is substantially composed of interest rate risk as we have no direct currency or commodity risk and de minimis equity risk we also have market risk related to capital markets loan originations as well as the valuation of our mortgage servicing rights 

interest rate risk 

interest rate risk emerges from the balance sheet after the aggregation of our assets liabilities and equity we refer to this nontrading risk embedded in the balance sheet as “structural interest rate risk” or “interest rate risk in the banking book” 

a major source of structural interest rate risk is a difference in the repricing of assets on the one hand and liabilities and equity on the other first there are differences in the timing and drivers of rate changes reflecting the maturity andor repricing of assets and liabilities for example the rate earned on a commercial loan may reprice monthly with changes in libor while the rate paid on debt or certificates of deposit may be fixed for a longer period there are differences in the drivers of rate changes as well loans may be tied to a specific index rate such as libor or prime while deposits may be only loosely correlated with libor and depend on competitive demand due to these basis differences net interest income is sensitive to changes in spreads between certain indices or repricing rates 

another important source of structural interest rate risk relates to the potential exercise of explicit or embedded options for example most consumer loans can be prepaid without penalty and most consumer deposits can be withdrawn without penalty the exercise of such options by customers can exacerbate the timing differences discussed above 

a primary source of our structural interest rate risk relates to faster repricing of floating rate loans relative to the retail deposit funding this source of asset sensitivity is more biased to the short end of the yield curve for the past few years the frb has been slowly raising shortterm rates to a more neutral stance and during that time the risk of rising rates seemed biased to the upside and thus we maintained an asset sensitive risk position as interest rates rose the risk position became more symmetrical given the possibility of falling rates in the future 

the secondary source of our interest rate risk is driven by longer term rates comprising the rollover or reinvestment risk on fixed rate loans as well as the prepayment risk on mortgage related loans and securities funded by nonrate sensitive deposits and equity 

the primary goal of interest rate risk management is to control exposure to interest rate risk within policy limits approved by the board these limits and guidelines reflect our tolerance for interest rate risk over both shortterm and longterm horizons to ensure that exposure to interest rate risk is managed within this risk appetite we must both measure the exposure and as necessary hedge it the treasury asset and liability management team is responsible for measuring monitoring and reporting on the structural interest rate risk position these exposures are reported on a monthly basis to the asset liability committee and at board meetings 

we measure structural interest rate risk through a variety of metrics intended to quantify both shortterm and longterm exposures the primary method that we use to quantify interest rate risk is simulation analysis in 

citizens financial group inc 

management’s discussion and analysis 

which we model net interest income from assets liabilities and hedge derivative positions under various interest rate scenarios over a threeyear horizon exposure to interest rate risk is reflected in the variation of forecasted net interest income across scenarios 

key assumptions in this simulation analysis relate to the behavior of interest rates and spreads the changes in product balances and the behavior of loan and deposit clients in different rate environments the most material of these behavioral assumptions relate to the repricing characteristics and balance fluctuations of deposits with indeterminate ie noncontractual maturities as well as the pace of mortgage prepayments assessments are periodically made by running sensitivity analysis of the impact of key assumptions the results of these analyses are reported to the asset liability committee 

as the future path of interest rates cannot be known in advance we use simulation analysis to project net interest income under various interest rate scenarios including a “most likely” implied forward scenario as well as a variety of deliberately extreme and perhaps unlikely scenarios these scenarios may assume gradual ramping of the overall level of interest rates immediate shocks to the level of rates and various yield curve twists in which movements in short or longterm rates predominate generally projected net interest income in any interest rate scenario is compared to net interest income in a base case where market forward rates are realized 

the table below reports net interest income exposures against a variety of interest rate scenarios our policies involve measuring exposures as a percentage change in net interest income over the next year due to either instantaneous or gradual parallel changes in rates relative to the market implied forward yield curve with rates rising from historically low levels due to federal open market committee rate increases exposure to falling rates has increased as the following table illustrates our balance sheet is assetsensitive net interest income would benefit from an increase in interest rates exposure to a decline in interest rates is within limit while an instantaneous and severe shift in interest rates was used in this analysis we believe that any actual shift in interest rates would likely be more gradual and would therefore have a more modest impact as demonstrated in the following table 

the table below presents the sensitivity of net interest income to various parallel yield curve shifts from the market implied forward yield curve 



asset sensitivity against a 200 basis point gradual increase in rates was 49  at december 31 2018  a slight decrease from 51  at december 31 2017  as the frb continues to normalize rates given improved economic growth and data the upward trend in rates has benefited our net interest income and net interest margin as a result of this asset sensitivity the risk position can be affected by changes in interest rates which impact the repricing sensitivity or beta of the deposit base as well as the cash flows on prepayable assets the risk position is managed within our risk limits and long term view of interest rates through occasional adjustments to securities investments interest rate swaps and mix of funding 

we use a valuation measure of exposure to structural interest rate risk economic value of equity “eve” as a supplement to net interest income simulations eve complements net interest income simulation analysis as it estimates risk exposure over a longterm horizon eve measures the extent to which the economic value of assets liabilities and offbalance sheet instruments may change in response to fluctuations in interest rates this analysis is highly dependent upon assumptions applied to assets and liabilities with noncontractual maturities the change in value is expressed as a percentage of regulatory capital 

capital markets 

citizens financial group inc 

management’s discussion and analysis 

a key component of our capital markets activities is the underwriting and distribution of corporate credit facilities to partially finance mergers and acquisitions transactions for our clients we have a rigorous risk management process around these activities including a limit structure capping our underwriting risk our potential loss and sub limits for specific asset classes further the ability to approve underwriting exposure is delegated only to senior level individuals in the credit risk management and capital markets organizations with each transaction adjudicated in a formal committee meeting 

mortgage servicing rights 

we have market risk associated with the value of residential mortgage servicing right assets “msrs” which are impacted by various types of inherent risks including risks related to duration basis convexity volatility and yield curve we have elected to account for the msrs acquired from famc at fair value while maintaining a lower of cost or market approach on our msrs held before the famc acquisition because the msrs acquired from famc are a separate class of msrs 

as part of our overall risk management strategy relative to the fair market value of the msrs acquired from famc we enter into various freestanding derivatives such as interest rate swaps interest rate swaptions interest rate futures and forward contracts to purchase mortgagebacked securities to economically hedge the changes in fair value as of december 31 2018  the fair value of the msrs acquired from famc was 600 million  and the total notional amount of related derivative contracts was 46 billion gains and losses on msrs and the related derivatives used for hedging are included in mortgage banking fees on the consolidated statements of operations 

as of december 31 2018  and 2017  our msrs held before the famc acquisition had a book value of 221 million  and 198 million  respectively and were carried at the lower of cost or market as of december 31 2018  and 2017  these msrs had a fair value of 243 million  and 218 million  respectively which exceeded the carrying value at those dates depending on the interest rate environment hedges may be used to protect the market value of these msrs 

as with our traded market risk based activities earnings at risk excludes the impact of msrs msrs are captured under our single price risk management framework that is used for calculating a management value at risk that is consistent with the definition used by banking regulators as defined below 

trading risk 

we are exposed to market risk primarily through client facilitation activities including derivatives and foreign exchange products as well as underwriting and market making activities exposure is created as a result of changes in interest rates and related basis spreads and volatility foreign exchange rates and credit spreads on a select range of interest rates foreign exchange commodities and secondary loan instruments these trading activities are conducted through our two banking subsidiaries cbna and cbpa 

client facilitation activities consist primarily of interest rate derivatives financially settled commodity derivatives and foreign exchange contracts where we enter into offsetting trades with a separate counterparty or exchange to manage our market risk exposure in addition to the aforementioned activities we operate a secondary loan trading desk with the objective to meet secondary liquidity needs of our issuing clients’ transactions and investor clients we do not engage in any trading activities with the intent to benefit from short term price differences 

we record said rate derivatives and foreign exchange contracts as derivative assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets trading assets and liabilities are carried at fair value with income earned related to these activities included in net interest income changes in fair value of trading assets and liabilities are reflected in other income a component of noninterest income on the consolidated statements of operations 

market risk governance   

the market risk limit setting process is established in line with the formal enterprise risk appetite process and policy this appetite reflects the strategic and enterprise level articulation of opportunities for creating franchise value set to the boundaries of how much market risk to take dealing authorities represent the key control tool in the management of market risk that allows the cascading of the risk appetite throughout the enterprise a dealing authority sets the operational scope and tolerances within which a business andor trading desk is permitted to operate and this is reviewed at least annually dealing authorities are structured to accommodate the client facing trades and hedges needed to manage the risk profile primary responsibility for keeping within established tolerances resides with the business key risk indicators including var open foreign currency positions and single name risk are monitored on a daily basis and reported against tolerances consistent with our risk appetite and business strategy to relevant business line management and risk counterparts

market risk measurement 

we use var as a statistical measure for estimating potential exposure of our traded market risk in normal market conditions our var framework for risk management and regulatory reporting is the same risk management var is based on a one day holding period to a 99 confidence level whereas regulatory var is based on a ten day holding period to the same confidence level additional to var nonstatistical measurements for measuring risk are employed such as sensitivity analysis market value and stress testing 

our market risk platform and associated market risk and valuation models for our foreign exchange interest rate products and traded loans capture correlation effects and allow for aggregation of market risk across risk types business lines and legal entities we measure monitor and report market risk for both management and regulatory capital purposes 

var overview 

  the market risk measurement model is based on historical simulation the var measure estimates the extent of any fair value losses on trading positions that may occur due to broad market movements general var such as changes in the level of interest rates foreign exchange rates equity prices and commodity prices it is calculated on the basis that current positions remain broadly unaltered over the course of a given holding period it is assumed that markets are sufficiently liquid to allow the business to close its positions if required within this holding period var’s benefit is that it captures the historic correlations of a portfolio based on the composition of our “covered positions” we also use a standardized addon approach for the loan trading desk’s specific risk capital which estimates the extent of any losses that may occur from factors other than broad market movements the general var approach is expressed in terms of a confidence level over the past 500 trading days the internal var measure used as the basis of the main var trading limits is a 99 confidence level with a one day holding period meaning that a loss greater than the var is expected to occur on average on only one day in 100 trading days ie 1 of the time theoretically there should be a loss event greater than var two to three times per year the regulatory measure of var is done at a 99 confidence level with a tenday holding period the historical market data applied to calculate the var is updated on a two business day lag refer to “market risk regulatory capital” below for details of our tenday var metrics for the quarters ended december 31 2018  and 2017  respectively including high low average and period end var for interest rate and foreign exchange rate risks as well as total var

market risk regulatory capital 

the us banking regulators’ “market risk rule” covers the calculation of market risk capital and substantially modified the determination of market riskweighted assets and implemented a more risk sensitive methodology for the risk inherent in certain trading positions categorized as “covered positions” for the purposes of the market risk rule all of our client facing trades and associated hedges need to maintain a low risk profile to qualify and do qualify as “covered positions” for the three months ended december 31 2018  and 2017 we were not subject to the reporting threshold under the market risk rule as a result the 785 million  and 555 million  of calculated market riskweighted assets as of december 31 2018  and 2017 respectively were not included in our riskweighted assets as such our covered trading activities were riskweighted under us basel iii standardized credit risk rules while not subject to the determination requirements of market riskweighted assets we nevertheless comply with the market risk rule’s other requirements the internal management var measure is calculated based on the same population of trades that is utilized for regulatory var the following table presents the results of our modeled and nonmodeled measures for regulatory capital calculations 



 1  for the three months ended december 31 2018  and 2017 we did not meet the reporting threshold prescribed by market risk capital guidelines 

stressed var 

svar is an extension of var but uses a longer historical lookback horizon that is fixed from january 3 2005 this is done not only to identify headline risks from more volatile periods but also to provide a counterbalance to var which may be low during periods of low volatility the holding period for profit and loss determination is ten days in addition to risk management purposes svar is also a component of market risk regulatory capital we calculate svar daily under its own dynamic window regime in a dynamic window regime values of the tenday 99 var are calculated over all possible 260day periods that can be obtained from the complete historical data set refer to “market risk regulatory capital” above for details of svar metrics including high low average and period end svar for the combined portfolio 

sensitivity analysis 

sensitivity analysis is the measure of exposure to a single risk factor such as a one basis point change in rates or credit spread we conduct and monitor sensitivity on interest rates basis spreads foreign exchange exposures option prices and credit spreads whereas var is based on previous moves in market risk factors over recent periods it may not be an accurate predictor of future market moves sensitivity analysis complements var as it provides an indication of risk relative to each factor irrespective of historical market moves and is an effective tool in evaluating the appropriateness of hedging strategies and concentrations

stress testing 

conducting a stress test of a portfolio consists of running risk models with the inclusion of key variables that simulate various historical or hypothetical scenarios for historical stress tests profit and loss results are simulated for selected time periods corresponding to the most volatile underlying returns while hypothetical stress tests aim to consider concentration risk illiquidity under stressed market conditions and risk arising from our trading activities that may not be fully captured by our other models hypothetical scenarios also assume that market moves happen simultaneously and no repositioning or hedging activity takes place to mitigate losses as events unfold we generate stress tests of our trading positions on a daily basis for example we currently include a stress test that simulates a “lehmantype” crisis scenario by taking the worst 20trading day peak to trough moves for the various risk factors that go into var from that period and assumes they occurred simultaneously 

var model review and validation

maintain a highperforming customercentric organization   to accomplish this we are embedding a “customerfirst” culture among our managers and colleagues to deliver the best possible banking experience for our customers for our colleagues we plan to drive talent management to the next level with a focus on attracting developing and retaining great people with a goal of ensuring strong leadership teamwork and a sense of accountability and urgency

competition 

the financial services industry is highly competitive our branch footprint is in the new england midatlantic and midwest regions though certain lines of business serve broader national markets within those markets we face competition from community banks superregional and national financial institutions credit unions savings and loan associations mortgage banking firms consumer finance companies securities brokerage firms insurance companies money market funds hedge funds and private equity firms some of our larger competitors may make available to their customers a broader array of product pricing and structure alternatives while some smaller competitors may have more liberal lending policies and processes competition among providers of financial products 

citizens financial group inc 

business 

and services continues to increase with consumers having the opportunity to select from a growing variety of traditional and nontraditional alternatives the ability of nonbanking financial institutions including fintech companies to provide services previously limited to commercial banks has also intensified competition 

in consumer banking the industry has become increasingly dependent on and oriented toward technologydriven delivery systems permitting transactions to be conducted through telephone online and mobile channels in addition technology has lowered barriers to entry and made it possible for nonbank institutions to attract funds and provide lending and other financial services in our footprint despite not having a physical presence within our footprint given their lower cost structure these institutions are often able to offer higher rates on deposit products than what may be average for the market for retail banking institutions with a traditional branch footprint such as us the primary factors driving competition for loans and deposits are interest rates fees charged customer service levels convenience including branch location and hours of operation and the range of products and services offered 

in commercial banking there is intense competition for quality loan originations from traditional banking institutions particularly large regional banks as well as commercial finance companies leasing companies and other nonbank lenders and institutional investors including clo managers hedge funds and private equity firms some larger competitors including certain national banks that compete in our market area may offer a broader array of products and due to their asset size may sometimes be in a position to hold more exposure on their own balance sheet we compete on a number of factors including among others providing innovative corporate finance solutions quality of customer service and execution range of products offered price and reputation 

regulation and supervision 

our operations are subject to extensive regulation supervision and examination under federal and state laws these laws and regulations cover all aspects of our business including lending practices safeguarding deposits customer privacy and information security capital structure liquidity transactions with affiliates and conduct and qualifications of personnel these laws and regulations are intended primarily for the protection of depositors the deposit insurance fund and the banking system as a whole and not for the protection of shareholders or other investors the discussion below outlines the material elements of selected laws and regulations applicable to us and our subsidiaries changes in applicable law or regulation and in their interpretation and application by regulatory agencies and other governmental authorities cannot be predicted but may have a material effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

we and our subsidiaries and affiliates are subject to numerous examinations by federal and state banking regulators as well as the sec finra and various state insurance and securities regulators in some cases regulatory agencies may take supervisory actions that may not be publicly disclosed and such actions may restrict or limit our activities or activities of our subsidiaries as part of our regular examination process our and our banking subsidiaries’ respective regulators may advise us or our banking subsidiaries to operate under various restrictions as a prudential matter we and our subsidiaries have periodically received requests for information from regulatory authorities at the federal and state level including from state insurance commissions state attorneys general federal agencies or law enforcement authorities securities regulators and other regulatory authorities concerning their business practices such requests are considered incidental to the normal conduct of business for a further discussion of how regulatory actions may impact our business see “risk factors” in part i item ia included in this report 

overview 

we are a bank holding company under the bank holding company act of 1956 “bank holding company act” while some banks have surrendered their bank holding company status we have elected to be treated as a financial holding company under amendments to the bank holding company act as effected by grammleachbliley act of 1999 “glba” as such we are subject to the supervision examination and reporting requirements of the bank holding company act and the regulations of the frb including through the federal reserve bank of boston under the system of “functional regulation” established under the bank holding company act the frb serves as the primary regulator of our consolidated organization and the primary regulator of our brokerdealer subsidiary the sec directly regulates the activities of that subsidiary with the frb exercising a supervisory role the doddfrank act amendments to the bank holding company act require the frb to examine the activities of nondepository institution subsidiaries of bank holding companies that are not functionally regulated that are engaged in depository institutionpermissible activities and provide the frb with backup examination and enforcement authority for such activities the frb also has the authority to require reports of and examine any holding company subsidiary 

our principal bank subsidiary cbna is a national banking association as such it is subject to regulation examination and supervision by the occ as its primary federal regulator and by the fdic as the insurer of its deposits 

citizens financial group inc 

business 

cbpa is a pennsylvaniachartered savings bank accordingly it is subject to supervision by the department of banking of the commonwealth of pennsylvania the “pa banking department” as its chartering agency and regulation supervision and examination by the fdic as the primary federal regulator of statechartered savings banks and as the insurer of cbpa’s deposits 

 the federal and state banking regulators have authority to approve or disapprove mergers acquisitions consolidations the establishment of branches and similar corporate actions these banking regulators also have the power to prevent the continuance or development of unsafe or unsound banking practices or other violations of law state and federal law govern the activities in which cbna and cbpa engage including the investments each makes and the aggregate amount of loans that they may grant to one borrower various consumer and compliance laws and regulations also affect their operations the actions the frb takes to implement monetary policy also affect cbna and cbpa 

in addition cbna and cbpa are subject to regulation supervision and examination by the cfpb with respect to consumer protection laws and regulations the cfpb has broad authority to among other things regulate the offering and provision of consumer financial products by depository institutions like cbna and cbpa with more than 10 billion in total assets the cfpb may promulgate rules under a variety of consumer financial protection statutes including the truth in lending act the electronic funds transfer act and the real estate settlement procedures act 

financial regulatory reform 

the doddfrank act represents a significant overhaul of many aspects of the regulation of the financial services industry addressing among other things systemic risk capital adequacy deposit insurance assessments consumer financial protection regulation of derivatives and securities markets restrictions on an insured bank’s transactions with its affiliates lending limits and mortgagelending practices moreover as a general matter in recent years the federal banking regulators the frb the occ and the fdic as well as the cfpb have taken a more stringent approach to supervising and regulating the financial institutions and financial products and services over which the regulators exercise their respective supervisory authorities including with respect to enforcement matters our two banking subsidiaries and our products and services have been subject to greater supervisory scrutiny and enhanced supervisory requirements and expectations in recent years and we expect this scrutiny to continue for the foreseeable future 

sections 165 and 166 of the doddfrank act direct the frb to establish enhanced prudential standards and early remediation requirements applicable to systemically important financial institutions “sifis” bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of 50 billion or more the frb has adopted final rules implementing three aspects of sections 165 and 166liquidity requirements stress testing of capital and overall risk management requirements the final rules’ liquidity requirements are described below under “—liquidity standards” and their stress testing requirements are described below under “—capital planning and stress testing requirements” 

under section 165 of the doddfrank act and the implementing rule of the frb and fdic a bank holding company with total consolidated assets of 50 billion such as us must submit a periodic resolution plan to the frb and fdic providing for the company’s strategy for rapid and orderly resolution in the event of its material financial distress or failure the fdic has also issued a separate resolution planning rule applicable to insured depository institutions of 50 billion or more in total assets such as cbna we submitted our most recent resolution plan to the frb and fdic in december 2016 cbna submitted its most recent resolution plan to the fdic in december 2015 if the frb and the fdic jointly determine that our plan is not credible or would not facilitate an orderly resolution under the us bankruptcy code and we do not cure the deficiencies the frb and the fdic may jointly impose more stringent capital leverage or liquidity requirements or restrictions on our growth activities or operations 

the frb has not yet adopted final rules implementing two key requirements of section 165 and 166single counterparty credit limits “sccl” and early remediation requirements in march 2016 the frb issued a reproposal of its sccl rules initially published for comment in 2014 as reproposed we and our controlled entities would be prohibited from having an aggregate net credit exposure to any counterparty as broadly defined in the proposed rule to include certain related entities to the entity that is the direct obligor exceeding 25 of our tier 1 capital the sccl rules when finalized may affect our ability to enter into transactions including as hedges for other exposures with other financial institutions 

the us basel iii rules summarized briefly below have impacted our level of capital and may influence the types of business we may pursue and how we pursue business opportunities among other things the us basel iii rules raised the required minimums for certain capital ratios added a common equity ratio included capital 

citizens financial group inc 

business 

buffers and restricted what constitutes capital the capital and risk weighting requirements became effective for us on january 1 2015 

in november 2017 a bipartisan group of senators introduced a bill to further reform the regulation of financial institutions most significantly for us this bill would substantially increase the asset threshold for automatic regulation of bank holding companies as sifis from 50 billion to 250 billion if enacted this bill would allow us to no longer be considered a sifi and would therefore exempt us from the enhanced prudential standards applicable to sifis the bill would also exempt bank holding companies with less than 250 billion in total consolidated assets such as us from the doddfrank act requirement to conduct companyrun stress tests and would revise supervisory stress testing for bank holding companies with between 100 and 250 billion in total consolidated assets by requiring that the frb conduct periodic instead of annual stress tests of those bank holding companies in order to evaluate whether those bank holding companies have consolidated capital necessary to absorb losses as a result of adverse economic conditions 

many of the provisions of the doddfrank act and other laws are subject to further rulemaking guidance and interpretation by the applicable federal regulators we will continue to evaluate the impact of any changes in law and any new regulations promulgated including changes in regulatory costs and fees modifications to consumer products or disclosures required by the cfpb and the requirements of the enhanced supervision provisions among others 

financial holding company regulation 

the bank holding company act generally restricts bank holding companies from engaging in business activities other than i banking managing or controlling banks ii furnishing services to or performing services for subsidiaries and iii activities that the frb has determined to be so closely related to banking as to be a proper incident thereto for so long as they continue to meet the eligibility requirements for financial holding company status financial holding companies may engage in a broader range of activities including among other things securities underwriting and dealing insurance underwriting and brokerage merchant banking and other activities that are determined by the frb in coordination with the treasury department to be “financial in nature or incidental thereto” or that the frb determines unilaterally to be “complementary” to financial activities in addition a financial holding company may conduct permissible new financial activities or acquire permissible nonbank financial companies with afterthefact notice to the frb 

as noted above we currently have elected to be treated as a financial holding company under amendments to the bank holding company act as effected by glba to maintain financial holding company status a financial holding company and all of its insured depository institution subsidiaries must remain well capitalized and well managed as described below under “federal deposit insurance act” and maintain a cra rating of at least “satisfactory” if a financial holding company ceases to meet the capital and management requirements the frb’s regulations provide that the financial holding company must enter into an agreement with the frb to comply with all applicable capital and management requirements until the financial holding company returns to compliance the frb may impose limitations or conditions on the conduct of its activities and the company may not commence any of the broader financial activities permissible for financial holding companies or acquire a company engaged in such financial activities without prior approval of the frb in addition the failure to meet such requirements could result in other material restrictions on the activities of the financial holding company may also adversely affect the financial holding company’s ability to enter into certain transactions including acquisition transactions or obtain necessary approvals in connection therewith and may result in the bank holding company losing financial holding company status any restrictions imposed on our activities by the frb may not necessarily be made known to the public if the company does not return to compliance within 180 days which period may be extended the frb may require the financial holding company to divest its subsidiary depository institutions or to discontinue or divest investments in companies engaged in activities permissible only for a bank holding company electing to be treated as a financial holding company bank holding companies and banks must also be both well capitalized and well managed in order to acquire banks located outside their home state 

capital 

we must comply with the frb’s capital adequacy rules cbna and cbpa must comply with similar capital adequacy rules of the occ and fdic respectively the capital adequacy rules of all three agencies are based on the basel iii framework for more detail on our regulatory capital see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — capital and regulatory matters” in part ii item 7 included in this report 

the us basel iii rules among other things i impose a capital measure called common equity tier 1 capital or “cet1 capital” ii specify that tier 1 capital consists of cet1 capital and “additional tier 1 capital” instruments 

citizens financial group inc 

business 

meeting certain revised requirements iii define cet1 capital narrowly by requiring that most deductionsadjustments to regulatory capital measures be made to cet1 and not to the other components of capital and iv expand the scope of the deductionsadjustments to capital as compared to previous regulations as noted below implementation of certain elements of the us basel iii rules continues to be phasedin 

under the us basel iii rules the minimum capital ratios are 

 the us basel iii rules also impose a capital conservation buffer “ccb” on top of the three minimum riskweighted asset ratios listed above when fully phasedin on january 1 2019 the ccb will be 25 banking institutions that fail to meet the effective minimum ratios once the ccb is taken into account that is 70 for cet1 capital to riskweighted assets 85 for tier 1 capital to riskweighted assets and 105 for total capital to riskweighted assets once the ccb is fully phasedin will be subject to constraints on capital distributions including dividends and share repurchases and certain discretionary executive compensation the severity of the constraints depends on the amount of the shortfall the implementation of the ccb began on january 1 2016 at the 0625 level and increases by 0625 on each subsequent january 1 until the buffer reaches its fully phasedin level of 25 on january 1 2019 for more details see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — capital and regulatory matters” in part ii item 7 included in this report 

we are also subject to the frbs riskbased capital requirements for market risk see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — market risk — market risk regulatory capital” in part ii item 7 included in this report for further discussion 

the us basel iii rules also provide for a number of deductions from and adjustments to cet1 capital for example certain deferred tax assets “dtas” and significant investments in nonconsolidated financial entities must be deducted from cet1 capital to the extent that any one such category exceeds 10 of cet1 capital or all such items in the aggregate exceed 15 of cet1 capital the deductions and other adjustments to cet1 capital generally became fully phasedin on january 1 2018 although as discussed below the federal banking regulators have extended the transitional treatment for certain items 

in november 2017 the federal banking regulators issued a final rule that extended the 2017 transition provisions for certain us basel iii capital rules for nonadvanced approaches banking organizations such as us effective january 1 2018 the final rule retains the 2017 us basel iii transitional treatment of certain dtas mortgage servicing assets investments in nonconsolidated financial entities and minority interests as a result effective january 1 2018 our mortgage servicing assets will retain their 2017 risk weight treatment until the federal banking regulators revise the extended transitional treatment under the november 2017 final rule which may occur in connection with the finalization of the related september 2017 proposal to simplify the capital treatment of certain dtas mortgage servicing assets investments in nonconsolidated financial entities and minority interests 

the us basel iii rules prescribe a standardized approach for risk weighting many categories of assets these categories generally range from 0 for us government and agency securities to 600 for certain equity exposures 

with respect to cbna and cbpa the us basel iii rules also revise the “prompt corrective action” regulations pursuant to section 38 of the federal deposit insurance act as discussed below in “federal deposit insurance act” 

in december 2017 the basel committee published standards that it described as the finalization of the basel iii postcrisis regulatory reforms the standards are commonly referred to as “basel iv” among other things these standards revise the basel committee’s standardized approach for credit risk including recalibrating risk weights and introducing new capital requirements for certain “unconditionally cancellable commitments” such as unused credit card and home equity lines of credit and provide a new standardized approach for operational risk capital under the basel framework these standards will generally be effective on january 1 2022 with an aggregate output floor phasing in through january 1 2027 under the current us basel iii rules operational risk capital requirements and a capital floor apply only to advanced approaches institutions and not to cfg cbna or cbpa the impact of basel iv on cfg cbna and cbpa will depend on the manner in which it is implemented by the frb occ and fdic

liquidity standards 

we are subject to the basel iiibased us lcr rule which is a quantitative liquidity metric designed to ensure that a covered bank or bank holding company maintains an adequate level of unencumbered highquality liquid assets to cover expected net cash outflows over a 30day time horizon under an acute liquidity stress scenario the lcr rule applies in its most comprehensive form only to advanced approaches bank holding companies that is those with 250 billion or more in total consolidated assets or 10 billion or more in onbalance sheet foreign exposures and depository institution subsidiaries of such bank holding companies the lcr rule applies in a modified form to bank holding companies such as the parent company that have 50 billion or more in total consolidated assets but that do not meet the thresholds for using the advanced approaches the us version of the lcr differs in certain respects from the basel committee’s version the us version includes a narrower definition of highquality liquid assets different prescribed cash inflow and outflow assumptions for certain types of instruments and transactions and a shorter phasein schedule that began on january 1 2015 and is now complete the modified lcr requires us to maintain a ratio of highquality liquid assets to net cash outflows of 70 compared to 100 in the comprehensive lcr applicable to advanced approaches bank holding companies at december 31 2017 our lcr on the modified basis was above the minimum requirement 

as a modified lcr company we are required to calculate our lcr on a monthly basis if a covered company fails to meet the minimum required lcr it must promptly notify its primary federal banking regulator and may be required to take remedial actions in december 2016 the frb issued a final rule that requires bank holding companies to disclose publicly on a quarterly basis quantitative and qualitative information about certain components of their lcr for modified lcr bank holding companies this disclosure requirement begins with the fourth quarter of 2018 

the basel iii framework also includes a second liquidity standard the nsfr which is designed to promote more medium and longterm funding of the assets and activities of banks over a oneyear time horizon in may 2016 the federal banking regulators issued a proposed rule that would implement the nsfr for large us banking organizations under the proposed rule the most stringent requirements would apply to advanced approaches bank holding companies and would require such organizations to maintain a minimum nsfr of 10 on an ongoing basis calculated by dividing the organization’s available stable funding “asf” by its required stable funding “rsf” bank holding companies with 50 billion or more in total consolidated assets but that are not advanced approaches bank holding companies would be subject to a modified nsfr requirement which would require such bank holding companies to maintain a minimum nsfr of 07 on an ongoing basis under the proposed rule a banking organization’s asf would be calculated by applying specified standard weightings to its equity and liabilities based on their expected stability over a oneyear time horizon and its rsf would be calculated by applying specified standardized weightings to its assets derivative exposures and commitments based on their liquidity characteristics over the same oneyear time horizon we continue to evaluate the potential effects of this proposal on our operations 

finally per the liquidity rules included in the frb’s enhanced prudential standards adopted pursuant to section 165 of the doddfrank act referred to above under “—financial regulatory reform” we are required to maintain a buffer of highly liquid assets based on projected funding needs for 30 days the liquidity buffer is in addition to the federal banking regulators’ lcr rule and is described by the frb as being “complementary” to the lcr 

  capital planning and stress testing requirements 

bank holding companies with 50 billion or more in total consolidated assets are required to develop and maintain a capital plan and to submit the capital plan to the frb for review under the ccar process ccar is designed to evaluate a bank holding company’s capital adequacy capital adequacy process and planned capital distributions such as dividend payments and common stock repurchases as part of ccar the frb evaluates whether a bank holding company has sufficient capital to continue operations under various hypothetical scenarios of economic and financial market stress these scenarios include both bank holding company and frb developed scenarios including an “adverse” and a “severely adverse” stress scenario developed by the frb the frb will also evaluate whether the bank holding company has robust forwardlooking capital planning processes that account for the bank holding company’s unique risks the financial regulation reform bill mentioned above would not address the applicability of ccar to bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of 50 billion or more however if enacted the federal reserve could revise the ccar process in a manner consistent with the legislation’s modification of the stress testing standards 

the capital plan must cover a “planning horizon” of at least nine quarters beginning with the quarter preceding the submission of the plan or january 1 2018 for the capital plans required to be filed on or before april 5 2018 bank holding companies are also subject to an ongoing requirement to revise and resubmit their capital plans upon the occurrence of certain events specified by rule or when required by the frb the frb determines 

citizens financial group inc 

business 

whether to object to a company’s capital plan based on whether the plan passes quantitative tests requiring that the company demonstrate that it will continue to meet all minimum capital requirements applicable to it over the ninequarter planning horizon under all applicable scenarios for capital plans in ccar submissions prior to april 5 2017 the frb was also able to object to the capital plan of any bank holding company subject to ccar based on qualitative tests such as concerns with the assumptions analysis or methodologies of the capital plan 

in january 2017 the frb amended its capital plan rule to eliminate its ability to object to the capital plan of a “large and noncomplex” bank holding company that is one that has less than 250 billion in total consolidated assets less than 75 billion in nonbank assets and that is not classified as a global systemically important bank holding company under the frb’s capital rules on qualitative grounds however the frb will incorporate an assessment of the qualitative aspects of the firm’s capital planning process into regular ongoing supervisory activities and through targeted horizontal assessments of particular aspects of capital planning 

in addition to other limitations our ability to make any capital distributions including dividends and share repurchases is contingent on the frb’s nonobjection to our capital plan should the frb object to a capital plan a bank holding company may not make any capital distribution other than those capital distributions to which the frb has indicated its nonobjection in writing participating firms are required to submit their capital plans and stress testing results to the frb on or before april 5 th  of each year and the frb will publish the results of its supervisory ccar review of submitted capital plans by june 30 th  of each year in addition the frb will separately publish the results of its supervisory stress test under both the supervisory severely adverse and adverse scenarios the information to be released will include among other things the frb’s projection of companyspecific information including poststress capital ratios and the minimum value of these ratios over the planning horizon 

the frb’s capital planning and stress testing rules generally limit our ability to make quarterly capital distributions in the form of dividends and share repurchases if the amount of our actual cumulative quarterly capital issuances of instruments that qualify as regulatory capital are less than we indicated in our submitted capital plan as to which we received a nonobjection from the frb due to the importance and intensity of the stress tests and the ccar process we have dedicated significant resources to comply with stress testing and capital planning requirements and expect to continue to do so in the future 

standards for safety and soundness 

the fdia requires the frb occ and fdic to prescribe operational and managerial standards for all insured depository institutions including cbna and cbpa the agencies have adopted regulations and interagency guidelines which set forth the safety and soundness standards used to identify and address problems at insured depository institutions before capital becomes impaired if an agency determines that a bank fails to satisfy any standard it may require the bank to submit an acceptable plan to achieve compliance consistent with deadlines for the submission and review of such safety and soundness compliance plans if after being notified to submit a compliance plan an institution fails to submit an acceptable compliance plan or fails in any material respect to implement an acceptable compliance plan the agency must issue an order directing action to correct the deficiency and may issue an order directing other actions of the types to which an undercapitalized institution is subject under the fdia see “federal deposit insurance act” below if an institution fails to comply with such an order the agency may seek to enforce such order in judicial proceedings and to impose civil money penalties 

cbpa is also subject to supervision by the pa banking department the pa banking department may order any pennsylvaniachartered savings bank to discontinue any violation of law or unsafe or unsound business practice it may also order the termination of any trustee officer attorney or employee of a savings bank engaged in objectionable activity 

federal deposit insurance act 

the fdia requires among other things that the federal banking regulators take “prompt corrective action” with respect to depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements as described above in “capital” the fdia sets forth the following five capital categories “wellcapitalized” “adequately capitalized” “undercapitalized” “significantly undercapitalized” and “critically undercapitalized” a depository institution’s capital category depends upon how its capital levels compare with various relevant capital measures and certain other factors that are established by regulation the federal banking regulators must take certain mandatory supervisory actions and are authorized to take other discretionary actions with respect to institutions that are undercapitalized significantly undercapitalized or critically undercapitalized with the actions becoming more restrictive and punitive the lower the institution’s capital category under existing rules an institution that is not an advanced approaches institution is deemed to be “well capitalized” if it has i a cet1 ratio of at least 65 ii 

citizens financial group inc 

business 

a tier 1 capital ratio of at least 8 iii a total capital ratio of at least 10 and iv a tier 1 leverage ratio of at least 5 

the fdia’s prompt corrective action provisions only apply to depository institutions and not to bank holding companies the frb’s regulations applicable to bank holding companies separately define “well capitalized” for bank holding companies to require maintaining a tier 1 capital ratio of at least 6 and a total capital ratio of at least 10 as described above under “—financial holding company regulation” a financial holding company that is not wellcapitalized and wellmanaged or whose bank subsidiaries are not well capitalized and well managed under applicable prompt corrective action standards may be restricted in certain of its activities and ultimately may lose financial holding company status as of december 31 2017 the parent company cbna and cbpa were wellcapitalized 

the fdia prohibits insured banks from accepting brokered deposits or offering interest rates on any deposits significantly higher than the prevailing rate in the bank’s normal market area or nationally depending upon where the deposits are solicited unless it is “wellcapitalized” or it is “adequately capitalized” and receives a waiver from the fdic a bank that is “adequately capitalized” and that accepts brokered deposits under a waiver from the fdic may not pay an interest rate on any deposit in excess of 75 basis points over certain prevailing market rates the fdia imposes no such restrictions on a bank that is “wellcapitalized” 

deposit insurance 

the fdia requires cbna and cbpa to pay deposit insurance assessments fdic assessment rates for large institutions are calculated based on one of two scorecards one for most large institutions that have more than 10 billion in assets and another for “highly complex” institutions that have over 50 billion in assets and are fully owned by a parent with over 500 billion in assets each scorecard has a performance score and a lossseverity score that are combined to produce a total score which is translated into an initial assessment rate in calculating these scores the fdic utilizes the camels ratings and forwardlooking financial measures to assess an institution’s ability to withstand assetrelated stress and fundingrelated stress the fdic has the ability to make discretionary adjustments to the total score up or down based upon significant risk factors that are not adequately captured in the scorecard the total score is then translated to an initial base assessment rate on a nonlinear sharplyincreasing scale since july 1 2016 for large institutions the initial base assessment rate has ranged from 3 to 30 basis points on an annualized basis after the effect of potential baserate adjustments the total base assessment rate could range from 15 to 40 basis points on an annualized basis 

the deposit insurance assessment is calculated based on average consolidated total assets less average tangible equity of the insured depository institution during the assessment period deposit insurance assessments are also affected by the minimum reserve ratio with respect to the deposit insurance fund “dif” in march 2016 the fdic issued a final rule that imposes on insured depository institutions with at least 10 billion in assets including cbna and cbpa a surcharge of 45 basis points per annum until the earlier of the quarter that the dif reaches the required reserve ratio of 135 and december 31 2018 which the fdic estimates will take approximately two years under the rule if the reserve ratio does not reach 135 by december 31 2018 the fdic will impose a shortfall assessment on larger depository institutions including cbna and cbpa in the first quarter of 2019 to be collected on june 30 2019 the rule has resulted in higher deposit insurance assessments for both cbna and cbpa 

under the fdia banks may also be held liable by the fdic for certain losses incurred or reasonably expected to be incurred by the dif either cbna or cbpa may be liable for losses caused by the other’s default and also may be liable for any assistance provided by the fdic to the other if in danger of default 

dividends 

various federal and statutory provisions and regulations as well as regulatory expectations limit the amount of dividends that we and our subsidiaries may pay 

our payment of dividends to our stockholders is subject to the oversight of the frb in particular the dividend policies and share repurchases of a large bank holding company are reviewed by the frb based on capital plans submitted as part of the ccar process and stress tests as submitted by the bank holding company as discussed above and will be assessed against among other things the bank holding company’s ability to achieve the required capital ratios under the basel iiibased us revised capital rules as they are phased in by us regulators in addition to other limitations our ability to make any capital distributions including dividends and share repurchases is contingent on the frb’s nonobjection to such planned distributions included in our submitted capital plan see “—capital” and “—capital planning and stress testing requirements” above 

citizens financial group inc 

business 

dividends payable by cbna as a national bank subsidiary are limited to the lesser of the amount calculated under a “recent earnings” test and an “undivided profits” test under the recent earnings test a dividend may not be paid if the total of all dividends declared by a bank in any calendar year is in excess of the current year’s net income combined with the retained net income of the two preceding years less any required transfers to surplus unless the national bank obtains the approval of the occ under the undivided profits test a dividend may not be paid in excess of the entity’s “undivided profits” generally accumulated net profits that have not been paid out as dividends or transferred to surplus federal bank regulatory agencies have issued policy statements which provide that fdicinsured depository institutions and their holding companies should generally pay dividends only out of their current operating earnings under pennsylvania law cbpa may declare and pay dividends only out of accumulated net earnings and only if i any required transfer to surplus has been made prior to declaration of the dividend and ii payment of the dividend will not reduce surplus 

support of subsidiary banks 

under section 616 of the doddfrank act which codifies the frb’s longstanding “source of strength” doctrine we must serve as a source of financial and managerial strength for our depository institution subsidiaries the statute defines “source of financial strength” as the ability to provide financial assistance in the event of the financial distress at the insured depository institution the frb may require that we provide such support at times even when we may not have the financial resources to do so or when doing so may not serve our interests or those of our shareholders or creditors in addition any capital loans by a bank holding company to its subsidiary bank are subordinate in right of payment to deposits and to certain other indebtedness of such subsidiary bank in the event of a bank holding company’s bankruptcy any commitment by the bank holding company to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to a priority of payment 

transactions with affiliates and insiders 

sections 23a and 23b of the federal reserve act and related frb rules including its regulation w restrict our bank subsidiaries from extending credit to or engaging in certain other transactions with us and our nonbank subsidiaries these restrictions place limits on certain specified “covered transactions” between these subsidiary banks and their affiliates which must be limited to 10 of a bank’s capital and surplus for any one affiliate and 20 for all affiliates furthermore within the foregoing limitations as to amount certain covered transactions must meet specified collateral requirements ranging from 100 to 130 covered transactions are defined to include among other things a loan or extension of credit as well as a purchase of securities issued by an affiliate a purchase of assets unless otherwise exempted by the frb from the affiliate the acceptance of securities issued by the affiliate as collateral for a loan derivatives transactions and securities lending transactions where the bank has credit exposure to an affiliate and the issuance of a guarantee acceptance or letter of credit on behalf of an affiliate all covered transactions including certain additional transactions such as transactions with a third party in which an affiliate has a financial interest must be conducted on market terms the doddfrank act significantly enhanced and expanded the scope and coverage of these limitations in particular by including within its scope derivative transactions by and between cbna or cbpa or their subsidiaries and the parent company or its other subsidiaries the frb enforces these restrictions and we are audited for compliance 

section 23b prohibits an institution from engaging in certain transactions with affiliates unless the transactions are on terms substantially the same or at least as favorable to the bank as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with nonaffiliated companies except for limitations on lowquality asset purchases and transactions that are deemed to be unsafe or unsound regulation w generally excludes affiliated depository institutions from treatment as affiliates transactions between a bank and any of its subsidiaries that are engaged in certain financial activities may be subject to the affiliated transaction limits the frb also may designate banking subsidiaries as affiliates 

pursuant to frb regulation o we are also subject to quantitative restrictions on extensions of credit to executive officers directors principal stockholders and their related interests in general such extensions of credit i may not exceed certain dollar limitations ii must be made on substantially the same terms including interest rates and collateral as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with third parties and iii must not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features certain extensions of credit also require the approval of our board

volcker rule 

the doddfrank act prohibits banks and their affiliates from engaging in proprietary trading and investing in sponsoring and having certain relationships with private funds such as hedge funds or private equity funds that would be an investment company for purposes of the investment company act of 1940 but for the exclusions in sections 3c1 or 3c7 of that act both subject to certain limited exceptions the statutory provision is commonly called the “volcker rule” in december 2013 the frb occ fdic the sec and the commodity futures trading commission “cftc” issued final rules to implement the volcker rule which became effective in july 2015 the final rules require that large bank holding companies design and implement compliance programs to ensure adherence to the volcker rule’s prohibitions development and monitoring of the required compliance program may require the expenditure of resources and management attention 

consumer financial protection regulations 

the retail activities of banks are subject to a variety of statutes and regulations designed to protect consumers and promote lending to various sectors of the economy and population these laws include but are not limited to the equal credit opportunity act the fair debt collection act the fair credit reporting act the truth in lending act the home mortgage disclosure act the service members civil relief act the expected funds availability act the right to financial privacy act the truth in savings act the electronic funds transfer act and their respective federal regulations and state law counterparts 

in addition to these federal laws and regulations the guidance and interpretations of the various federal agencies charged with the responsibility of implementing such regulations also influences loan and deposit operations 

the cfpb has broad rulemaking supervisory examination and enforcement authority over various consumer financial protection laws including the laws referenced above fair lending laws and certain other statutes the cfpb also has examination and primary enforcement authority with respect to depository institutions with 10 billion or more in assets including the authority to prevent unfair deceptive or abusive practices in connection with the offering of consumer financial products 

the doddfrank act permits states to adopt stricter consumer protection laws and standards that are more stringent than those adopted at the federal level and in certain circumstances permits state attorneys general to enforce compliance with both the state and federal laws and regulations state regulation of financial products and potential enforcement actions could also adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

the cfpb implemented a number of significant rules which will impact nearly every aspect of the life cycle of a residential mortgage the final rules require banks to among other things i develop and implement procedures to ensure compliance with a new “ability to repay” standard and identify whether a loan meets a new definition for a “qualified mortgage” ii implement new or revised disclosures policies and procedures for servicing mortgages including but not limited to early intervention with delinquent borrowers and specific loss mitigation procedures for loans secured by a borrower’s principal residence iii comply with additional restrictions on mortgage loan originator hiring and compensation iv comply with new disclosure requirements and standards for appraisals and certain financial products and v maintain escrow accounts for “higher priced mortgage loans” for a longer period of time 

as previously reported cbna entered into a consent order with the occ in november 2015 in connection with past billing practices all financial penalties and remediation associated with this legacy matter have been paid and completed 

protection of customer personal information and cybersecurity 

the privacy provisions of glba generally prohibit financial institutions including us from disclosing nonpublic personal financial information of consumer customers to third parties for certain purposes primarily marketing unless customers have the opportunity to opt out of the disclosure the fair credit reporting act restricts information sharing among affiliates for marketing purposes both the fair credit reporting act and regulation v issued by the frb govern the use and provision of information to consumer reporting agencies 

in march 2015 federal regulators issued two related statements regarding cybersecurity one statement indicates that financial institutions should design multiple layers of security controls to establish lines of defense and to ensure that their risk management processes also address the risk posed by compromised customer credentials including security measures to reliably authenticate customers’ accessing internetbased services of the financial institution the other statement indicates that a financial institution’s management is expected to maintain sufficient business continuity planning processes to ensure the rapid recovery resumption and maintenance of the institution’s operations after a cyber attack involving destructive malware a financial institution is also expected to develop

appropriate processes to enable recovery of data and business operations and address rebuilding network capabilities and restoring data if the institution or its critical service providers fall victim to this type of cyber attack if we fail to observe the regulatory guidance we could be subject to various regulatory sanctions including financial penalties for a further discussion of risks related to cybersecurity see “risk factors” in part i item 1a included in this report 

in october 2016 federal regulators jointly issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking on enhanced cyber risk management standards that are intended to increase the operational resilience of large and interconnected entities under their supervision once established the enhanced cyber risk management standards would help to reduce the potential impact of a cyberattack or other cyberrelated failure on the financial system the advance notice of proposed rulemaking addresses five categories of cyber standards i cyber risk governance ii cyber risk management iii internal dependency management iv external dependency management and v incident response cyber resilience and situational awareness we will continue to monitor any developments related to this proposed rulemaking 

state regulators have also been increasingly active in implementing privacy and cybersecurity standards and regulations in 2017 several states adopted regulations requiring certain financial institutions to implement cybersecurity programs and providing detailed requirements with respect to these programs including data encryption requirements many states have also recently implemented or modified their data breach notification and data privacy requirements we expect this trend of statelevel activity to continue and are continually monitoring developments in the states in which we operate 

community reinvestment act requirements 

the cra requires banking regulators to evaluate us and our banking subsidiaries in meeting the credit needs of our local communities including providing credit to individuals residing in low and moderate income neighborhoods the cra requires each appropriate federal bank regulatory agency in connection with its examination of a depository institution to assess such institution’s record in assessing and meeting the credit needs of the community served by that institution and assign ratings the regulatory agency’s assessment of the institution’s record is made available to the public these evaluations are also considered in evaluating mergers acquisitions and applications to open a branch or facility and in the case of a bank holding company that has elected financial holding company status a cra rating of “satisfactory” is required to commence certain new financial activities or to acquire a company engaged in such activities we received a rating of “satisfactory” in our mostrecent cra evaluation 

compensation 

our compensation practices are subject to oversight by the frb the federal banking regulators have issued guidance designed to ensure that incentive compensation arrangements at banking organizations take into account risk and are consistent with safe and sound practices the guidance sets forth the following three key principles with respect to incentive compensation arrangements i the arrangements should provide employees with incentives that appropriately balance risk and financial results in a manner that does not encourage employees to expose their organizations to imprudent risk ii the arrangements should be compatible with effective controls and risk management and iii the arrangements should be supported by strong corporate governance the guidance provides that supervisory findings with respect to incentive compensation will be incorporated as appropriate into the organization’s supervisory ratings which can affect its ability to make acquisitions or perform other actions the guidance also provides that enforcement actions may be taken against a banking organization if its incentive compensation arrangements or related risk management control or governance processes pose a risk to the organization’s safety and soundness 

the us financial regulators including the frb and the sec have jointly proposed regulations to among other things prohibit incentivebased compensation arrangements that encourage inappropriate risk taking at specified regulated entities having at least 1 billion in total assets including the parent company and cbna these regulations were initially proposed in 2011 and reproposed in 2016 they have not been finalized and the timing of final adoption and the form of any final regulations is uncertain if the rules are adopted in the form proposed they may restrict our flexibility with respect to the manner in which we structure compensation and adversely affect our ability to compete for talent 

antimoney laundering 

the usa patriot act enacted in 2001 and renewed in 2006 substantially broadened the scope of us antimoney laundering laws and regulations by imposing significant new compliance and due diligence obligations creating new crimes and penalties and expanding the extraterritorial jurisdiction of the united states institutions must 

citizens financial group inc

maintain antimoney laundering programs that include established internal policies procedures and controls a designated compliance officer an ongoing employee training program and testing of the program by an independent audit function we are prohibited from entering into specified financial transactions and account relationships and must meet enhanced standards for due diligence in dealings with foreign financial institutions and foreign customers we also must take reasonable steps to conduct enhanced scrutiny of account relationships to guard against money laundering and to report any suspicious transactions recent laws provide law enforcement authorities with increased access to financial information maintained by banks 

the usa patriot act also provides for the facilitation of information sharing among governmental entities and financial institutions for the purpose of combating terrorism and money laundering the statute also creates enhanced information collection tools and enforcement mechanics for the us government including i requiring standards for verifying customer identification at account opening ii promulgating rules to promote cooperation among financial institutions regulators and law enforcement entities in identifying parties that may be involved in terrorism or money laundering iii requiring reports by nonfinancial trades and businesses filed with the treasury’s financial crimes enforcement network “fincen” for transactions exceeding 10000 and iv mandating the filing of suspicious activities reports if a bank believes a customer may be violating us laws and regulations the statute also requires enhanced due diligence requirements for financial institutions that administer maintain or manage private bank accounts or correspondent accounts for nonus persons bank regulators routinely examine institutions for compliance with these obligations and are required to consider compliance in connection with the regulatory review of applications 

in 2014 fincen which drafts regulations implementing the usa patriot act and other antimoney laundering and bank secrecy act legislation proposed a rule that would require financial institutions to obtain beneficial ownership information with respect to legal entities with which such institutions conduct business subject to certain exclusions and exemptions in may 2016 fincen issued its final rules with respect to customer due diligence requirements and financial institutions that are subject to these final rules are required to comply by may 2018 bank regulators are focusing their examinations on antimoney laundering compliance and we continue to monitor and augment where necessary our antimoney laundering compliance programs

  heightened risk governance standards 

in september 2014 the occ finalized guidelines that establish heightened risk governance standards for large national banks with average total consolidated assets of 50 billion or more including cbna the guidelines set forth minimum standards for the design and implementation of a bank’s risk governance framework and minimum standards for oversight of that framework by a bank’s board of directors the guidelines are an extension of the occ’s “heightened expectations” for large banks that the occ began informally communicating to certain banks in 2010 the guidelines are intended to protect the safety and soundness of covered banks and improve bank examiners’ ability to assess compliance with the occ’s expectations under the guidelines a bank could use certain components of its parent company’s risk governance framework but the framework must ensure that the bank’s risk profile is easily distinguished and separate from the parent’s for risk management and supervisory purposes a bank’s board of directors is required to have two members who are independent of the bank and parent company management a bank’s board of directors is responsible for ensuring that the risk governance framework meets the standards in the guidelines providing active oversight and a credible challenge to management’s recommendations and decisions and ensuring that the parent company decisions do not jeopardize the safety and soundness of the bank

commercial real estate lending 

lending operations that involve concentrations of commercial real estate loans are subject to enhanced scrutiny by federal banking regulators regulators have advised financial institutions of the risks posed by commercial real estate lending concentrations such loans generally include land development construction loans and loans secured by multifamily property and nonfarm nonresidential real property where the primary source of repayment is derived from rental income associated with the property the relevant regulatory guidance prescribes the following guidelines for examiners to help identify institutions that are potentially exposed to concentration risk and may warrant greater supervisory scrutiny 

 in addition the doddfrank act contains provisions that may cause us to reduce the amount of our commercial real estate lending and increase the cost of borrowing including rules relating to risk retention of securitized assets section 941 of the doddfrank act and implementing rules adopted by the us financial services regulators including the federal banking regulators and the sec require among other things a loan originator or a securitizer of assetbacked securities to retain a percentage of the credit risk of securitized assets we continue to analyze the impact that such rules have on our business

our business strategy is designed to maximize the full potential of our business and drive sustainable growth and enhanced profitability and our success rests on our ability to i maintain a highperforming customercentric organization ii develop differentiated value propositions to acquire deepen and retain core customer segments iii build excellent capabilities that will allow us to stand out from our competitors iv operate with financial discipline and a mindset of continuous improvement to selffund investments v prudently grow and optimize our balance sheet vi modernize our technology and operational models to improve delivery agility and speed to market and vii embed risk management within our culture and our operations our future success and the value of our stock will depend in part on our ability to effectively implement our business strategy there are risks and uncertainties many of which are not within our control associated with each element of our strategy if we are not able to successfully execute our business strategy we may never achieve our financial performance goals and any shortfall may be material see “business strategy” in part i item 1 — business  included in this report for further information 

supervisory requirements and expectations on us as a financial holding company and a bank holding company and any regulatorimposed limits on our activities could adversely affect our ability to implement our strategic plan expand our business continue to improve our financial performance and make capital distributions to our stockholders 

in recent years the federal banking agencies the frb the occ and the fdic as well as the cfpb have generally taken a more stringent approach to supervising and regulating financial institutions and financial products and services over which they exercise their respective supervisory authorities this increased supervisory stringency is a result of and in addition to legislation aimed at regulatory reform such as the doddfrank act and the increased capital and liquidity requirements imposed by the us implementation of the basel iii framework we our two banking subsidiaries and our products and services are all subject to greater supervisory scrutiny and enhanced supervisory requirements and expectations we expect to continue to face this heightened level of supervisory scrutiny and enhanced supervisory requirements in the foreseeable future 

in addition as part of the supervisory and examination process if we are unsuccessful in meeting the supervisory requirements and expectations that apply to us and our banking subsidiaries regulatory agencies may from time to time take supervisory actions against us that may not be publicly disclosed such actions may include restrictions on our activities or the activities of our subsidiaries informal nonpublic or formal public supervisory actions or public enforcement actions including the payment of civil money penalties which could increase our costs and limit our ability to implement our strategic plans and expand our business and as a result could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations

changes in interest rates may have an adverse effect on our profitability 

net interest income historically has been and in the neartomedium term we anticipate that it will remain a significant component of our total revenue this is due to the fact that a high percentage of our assets and liabilities have been and will likely continue to be in the form of interestbearing or interestrelated instruments changes in interest rates can have a material effect on many areas of our business including net interest income deposit costs loan volume and delinquency and the value of our mortgage servicing rights interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond our control including general economic conditions and policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies and in particular the federal open market committee changes in monetary policy including changes in interest rates could influence not only the interest we receive on loans and securities and the amount of interest we pay on deposits and borrowings but such changes could also affect our ability to originate loans and obtain deposits and the fair value of our financial assets and liabilities if the interest rates on our interestbearing liabilities increase at a faster pace than the interest rates on our interest earning assets our net interest income may decline and with it a decline in our earnings may occur our net interest income and our earnings would be similarly affected if the interest rates on our interest earning assets declined at a faster pace than the interest rates on our interestbearing liabilities 

we cannot control or predict with certainty changes in interest rates global national regional and local economic conditions competitive pressures and the policies of regulatory authorities including monetary policies of the frb affect interest income and interest expense although we have policies and procedures designed to manage the risks associated with changes in market interest rates as further discussed under “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations —  risk governance” in part ii item 7 included in this report changes in interest rates still may have an adverse effect on our profitability 

if our ongoing assumptions regarding borrower or depositor behavior are wrong or overall economic conditions are significantly different than we anticipate then our risk mitigation may be insufficient to protect against interest rate risk and our net income would be adversely affected 

we could fail to attract retain or motivate highly skilled and qualified personnel including our senior management other key employees or members of our board which could impair our ability to successfully execute our strategic plan and otherwise adversely affect our business 

a cornerstone of our strategic plan involves the hiring of highly skilled and qualified personnel accordingly our ability to implement our strategic plan and our future success depends on our ability to attract retain and motivate highly skilled and qualified personnel including our senior management and other key employees and directors competitive with our peers the marketplace for skilled personnel is becoming more competitive which means the cost of hiring incentivizing and retaining skilled personnel may continue to increase the failure to attract or retain including as a result of an untimely death or illness of key personnel or replace a sufficient number of appropriately skilled and key personnel could place us at a significant competitive disadvantage and prevent us from successfully implementing our strategy which could impair our ability to implement our strategic plan successfully achieve our performance targets and otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

in may 2016 the frb other federal banking agencies and the securities and exchange commission jointly published reproposed rules originally proposed in april 2011 designed to implement provisions of the doddfrank act prohibiting incentive compensation arrangements that would encourage inappropriate risk taking at covered financial institutions which includes a bank or bank holding company with 1 billion or more of assets although the reproposed rules include more stringent requirements particularly for larger institutions it cannot be determined at this time whether or when a final rule will be adopted compliance with such a final rule may substantially affect the manner in which we structure compensation for our executives and other employees depending on the nature and application of the final rules we may not be able to successfully compete with certain financial institutions and other companies that are not subject to some or all of the rules to retain and attract executives and other high performing employees if this were to occur our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected perhaps materially 

our ability to meet our obligations and the cost of funds to do so depend on our ability to access identified sources of liquidity at a reasonable cost 

liquidity risk is the risk that we will not be able to meet our obligations including funding commitments as they come due this risk is inherent in our operations and can be heightened by a number of factors including 

citizens financial group inc 

risk factors 

an overreliance on a particular source of funding including for example secured fhlb advances changes in credit ratings or marketwide phenomena such as market dislocation and major disasters like many banking groups our reliance on customer deposits to meet a considerable portion of our funding has grown over recent years and we continue to seek to increase the proportion of our funding represented by customer deposits however these deposits are subject to fluctuation due to certain factors outside our control such as increasing competitive pressures for retail or corporate customer deposits changes in interest rates and returns on other investment classes or a loss of confidence by customers in us or in the banking sector generally which could result in a significant outflow of deposits within a short period of time to the extent there is heightened competition among us banks for retail customer deposits this competition may increase the cost of procuring new deposits andor retaining existing deposits and otherwise negatively affect our ability to grow our deposit base an inability to grow or any material decrease in our deposits could have a material adverse effect on our ability to satisfy our liquidity needs 

maintaining a diverse and appropriate funding strategy for our assets consistent with our wider strategic risk appetite and plan remains challenging and any tightening of credit markets could have a material adverse impact on us in particular there is a risk that corporate and financial institution counterparties may seek to reduce their credit exposures to banks and other financial institutions for example reductions in unsecured deposits supplied by these counterparties which may cause funding from these sources to no longer be available under these circumstances we may need to seek funds from alternative sources potentially at higher costs than has previously been the case or may be required to consider disposals of other assets not previously identified for disposal in order to reduce our funding commitments 

a reduction in our credit ratings which are based on a number of factors could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

credit ratings affect the cost and other terms upon which we are able to obtain funding rating agencies regularly evaluate us and their ratings are based on a number of factors including our financial strength other factors considered by rating agencies include conditions affecting the financial services industry generally any downgrade in our ratings would likely increase our borrowing costs could limit our access to capital markets and otherwise adversely affect our business for example a ratings downgrade could adversely affect our ability to sell or market certain of our securities including longterm debt engage in certain longerterm derivatives transactions and retain our customers particularly corporate customers who may require a minimum rating threshold in order to place funds with us in addition under the terms of certain of our derivatives contracts we may be required to maintain a minimum credit rating or have to post additional collateral or terminate such contracts any of these results of a rating downgrade could increase our cost of funding reduce our liquidity and have adverse effects on our business financial condition and results of operations

our financial performance may be adversely affected by deterioration in borrower credit quality particularly in the new england midatlantic and midwest regions where our operations are concentrated 

we have exposure to many different industries and risks arising from actual or perceived changes in credit quality and uncertainty over the recoverability of amounts due from borrowers is inherent in our businesses our exposure may be exacerbated by the geographic concentration of our operations which are predominately located in the new england midatlantic and midwest regions the credit quality of our borrowers may deteriorate for a number of reasons that are outside our control including as a result of prevailing economic and market conditions and asset valuation the trends and risks affecting borrower credit quality particularly in the new england midatlantic and midwest regions have caused and in the future may cause us to experience impairment charges increased repurchase demands higher costs additional writedowns and losses and an inability to engage in routine funding transactions which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our framework for managing risks may not be effective in mitigating risk and loss 

our risk management framework is made up of various processes and strategies to manage our risk exposure the framework to manage risk including the framework’s underlying assumptions may not be effective under all conditions and circumstances if the risk management framework proves ineffective we could suffer unexpected losses and could be materially adversely affected 

one of the main types of risks inherent in our business is credit risk an important feature of our credit risk management system is to employ an internal credit risk control system through which we identify measure monitor and mitigate existing and emerging credit risk of our customers as this process involves detailed analyses of the customer or credit risk taking into account both quantitative and qualitative factors it is subject to human error in exercising their judgment our employees may not always be able to assign an accurate credit rating to a customer or credit risk which may result in our exposure to higher credit risks than indicated by our risk rating system 

in addition we have undertaken certain actions to enhance our credit policies and guidelines to address potential risks associated with particular industries or types of customers as discussed in more detail under “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations —  risk governance” and “ —  market risk” in part ii item 7 included in this report however we may not be able to effectively implement these initiatives or consistently follow and refine our credit risk management system if any of the foregoing were to occur it may result in an increase in the level of nonperforming loans and a higher risk exposure for us which could have a material adverse effect on us 

our financial and accounting estimates and risk management framework rely on analytical forecasting and models 

the processes we use to estimate our inherent loan losses and to measure the fair value of financial instruments as well as the processes used to estimate the effects of changing interest rates and other market measures on our financial condition and results of operations depends upon the use of analytical and forecasting models some of our tools and metrics for managing risk are based upon our use of observed historical market behavior we rely on quantitative models to measure risks and to estimate certain financial values models may be used in such processes as determining the pricing of various products grading loans and extending credit measuring interest rate and other market risks predicting losses assessing capital adequacy and calculating regulatory capital levels as well as estimating the value of financial instruments and balance sheet items poorly designed or implemented models present the risk that our business decisions based on information incorporating such models will be adversely affected due to the inadequacy of that information moreover our models may fail to predict future risk exposures if the information used in the model is incorrect obsolete or not sufficiently comparable to actual events as they occur we seek to incorporate appropriate historical data in our models but the range of market values and behaviors reflected in any period of historical data is not at all times predictive of future developments in any particular period and the period of data we incorporate into our models may turn out to be inappropriate for the future period being modeled in such case our ability to manage risk would be limited and our risk exposure and losses could be significantly greater than our models indicated in addition if existing or potential customers believe our risk management is inadequate they could take their business elsewhere this could harm our reputation as well as our revenues and profits finally information we provide to our regulators based on poorly designed or implemented models could also be inaccurate or misleading some of the decisions that our regulators make including those related to capital distributions to our stockholders could be affected adversely due to their perception that the quality of the models used to generate the relevant information is insufficient

the preparation of our financial statements requires the use of estimates that may vary from actual results particularly various factors may cause our alll to increase 

the preparation of audited consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make significant estimates that affect the financial statements our most critical accounting estimate is the alll the alll is a reserve established through a provision for loan and lease losses charged to expense and represents our estimate of incurred but unrealized losses within the existing portfolio of loans the alll is necessary to reserve for estimated loan and lease losses and risks inherent in the loan portfolio the level of the alll reflects our ongoing evaluation of industry concentrations specific credit risks loan and lease loss experience current loan portfolio quality present economic political and regulatory conditions and incurred losses inherent in the current loan portfolio 

the determination of the appropriate level of the alll inherently involves a degree of subjectivity and requires that we make significant estimates of current credit risks and future trends all of which may undergo material changes changes in economic conditions affecting borrowers the stagnation of certain economic indicators that we are more susceptible to such as unemployment and real estate values new information regarding existing loans identification of additional problem loans and other factors both within and outside our control may require an increase in the alll in addition bank regulatory agencies periodically review our alll and may require an increase in the alll or the recognition of further loan chargeoffs based on judgments that can differ from those of our own management in addition if chargeoffs in future periods exceed the alll—that is if the alll is inadequate—we will need additional loan and lease loss provisions to increase the alll should such additional provisions become necessary they would result in a decrease in net income and capital and may have a material adverse effect on us 

operational risks are inherent in our businesses 

our operations depend on our ability to process a very large number of transactions efficiently and accurately while complying with applicable laws and regulations operational risk and losses can result from internal and external fraud improper conduct or errors by employees or third parties failure to document transactions properly or to obtain proper authorization failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements and conduct of business rules equipment failures including those caused by natural disasters or by electrical telecommunications or other essential utility outages business continuity and data security system failures including those caused by computer viruses cyberattacks or unforeseen problems encountered while implementing major new computer systems or upgrades to existing systems or the inadequacy or failure of systems and controls including those of our suppliers or counterparties although we have implemented risk controls and loss mitigation actions and substantial resources are devoted to developing efficient procedures identifying and rectifying weaknesses in existing procedures and training staff it is not possible to be certain that such actions have been or will be effective in controlling each of the operational risks faced by us any weakness in these systems or controls or any breaches or alleged breaches of such laws or regulations could result in increased regulatory supervision enforcement actions and other disciplinary action and have an adverse impact on our business applicable authorizations and licenses reputation and results of operations 

the financial services industry including the banking sector is undergoing rapid technological changes as a result of competition and changes in the legal and regulatory framework and we may not be able to compete effectively as a result of these changes 

the financial services industry including the banking sector is continually undergoing rapid technological change with frequent introductions of new technologydriven products and services in addition new unexpected technological changes could have a disruptive effect on the way banks offer products and services we believe our success depends to a great extent on our ability to address customer needs by using technology to offer products and services that provide convenience to customers and to create additional efficiencies in our operations however we may not be able to among other things keep up with the rapid pace of technological changes effectively implement new technologydriven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to our customers as a result our ability to compete effectively to attract or retain new business may be impaired and our business financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected 

in addition changes in the legal and regulatory framework under which we operate require us to update our information systems to ensure compliance our need to review and evaluate the impact of ongoing rule proposals final rules and implementation guidance from regulators further complicates the development and implementation of new information systems for our business also recent regulatory guidance has focused on the need for financial

institutions to perform increased due diligence and ongoing monitoring of thirdparty vendor relationships thus increasing the scope of management involvement and decreasing the efficiency otherwise resulting from our relationships with thirdparty technology providers given the significant number of ongoing regulatory reform initiatives it is possible that we incur higher than expected information technology costs in order to comply with current and impending regulations see “ — supervisory requirements and expectations on us as a financial holding company and a bank holding company and any regulatorimposed limits on our activities could adversely affect our ability to implement our strategic plan expand our business continue to improve our financial performance and make capital distributions to our stockholders” 

we are subject to a variety of cybersecurity risks that if realized could adversely affect how we conduct our business 

information security risks for large financial institutions such as cfg have increased significantly in recent years in part because of the proliferation of new technologies such as internet and mobile banking to conduct financial transactions and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime hackers terrorists nationstates activists and other external parties third parties with whom we or our customers do business also present operational and information security risks to us including security breaches or failures of their own systems the possibility of employee error failure to follow security procedures or malfeasance also presents these risks our operations rely on the secure processing transmission and storage of confidential information in our computer systems and networks in addition to access our products and services our customers may use personal computers smartphones tablets and other mobile devices that are beyond our control environment although we believe that we have appropriate information security procedures and controls our technologies systems networks and our customers’ devices may be the target of cyberattacks or information security breaches that could result in the unauthorized release gathering monitoring misuse loss or destruction of the confidential andor proprietary information of cfg our customers our vendors our counterparties or our employees we are under continuous threat of loss due to cyberattacks especially as we continue to expand customer capabilities to utilize the internet and other remote channels to transact business two of the most significant cyberattack risks that we face are efraud and loss of sensitive customer data loss from efraud occurs when cybercriminals extract funds directly from customers’ or our accounts using fraudulent schemes that may include internetbased funds transfers we have been subject to a number of efraud incidents historically we have also been subject to attempts to steal sensitive customer data such as account numbers and social security numbers through unauthorized access to our computer systems including computer hacking such attacks are less frequent but could present significant reputational legal and regulatory costs to us if successful we have implemented certain technology protections such as customer profiling and setup authentication to be in compliance with the ffiec authentication in internet banking environment “aibe” guidelines 

as cyber threats continue to evolve we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our layers of defense or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities system enhancements and updates may also create risks associated with implementing new systems and integrating them with existing ones due to the complexity and interconnectedness of information technology systems the process of enhancing our layers of defense can itself create a risk of systems disruptions and security issues in addition addressing certain information security vulnerabilities such as hardwarebased vulnerabilities may affect the performance of our information technology systems the ability of our hardware and software providers to deliver patches and updates to mitigate vulnerabilities in a timely manner can introduce additional risks particularly when a vulnerability is being actively exploited by threat actors 

the techniques used by cyber criminals change frequently may not be recognized until launched and can be initiated from a variety of sources including terrorist organizations and hostile foreign governments these actors may attempt to fraudulently induce employees customers or other users of our systems to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to data or our systems in the event that a cyberattack is successful our business financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected for a discussion of the guidance that federal banking regulators have released regarding cybersecurity and cyber risk management standards see “regulation and supervision” in part i item 1 —  business included in this report

we rely heavily on communications and information systems to conduct our business 

we rely heavily on communications and information systems to conduct our business any failure interruption or breach in security of these systems including due to hacking or other similar attempts to breach information technology security protocols could result in failures or disruptions in our customer relationship management general ledger deposit loan and other systems although we have established policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the effect of the possible failure interruption or security breach of our information systems there can be no assurance that these policies and procedures will be successful and that any such failure interruption or security breach will not occur or if they do occur that they will be adequately addressed the occurrence of any failure interruption or security breach of our information systems could require us to devote substantial resources including management time and attention to recovery and response efforts damage our reputation result in a loss of customer business subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny or expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability although we maintain insurance coverage for information security events we may incur losses as a result of such events that are not insured against or not fully covered by our insurance 

we rely on third parties for the performance of a significant portion of our information technology 

we rely on third parties for the performance of a significant portion of our information technology functions and the provision of information technology and business process services for example i unaffiliated third parties operate data communications networks on which certain components and services relating to our online banking system rely ii third parties host or maintain many of our applications including our commercial loan system which is hosted and maintained by automated financial systems inc iii fidelity national information services inc maintains our core deposits system and iv ibm corporation provides us with a wide range of information technology support services including end user data center network mainframe storage and database services the success of our business depends in part on the continuing ability of these and other third parties to perform these functions and services in a timely and satisfactory manner which performance could be disrupted or otherwise adversely affected due to failures or other information security events originating at the third parties or at the third parties’ suppliers or vendors socalled “fourth party risk” we may not be able to effectively monitor or mitigate fourthparty risk in particular as it relates to the use of common suppliers or vendors by the third parties that perform functions and services for us if we experience a disruption in the provision of any functions or services performed by third parties we may have difficulty in finding alternate providers on terms favorable to us and in reasonable timeframes if these services are not performed in a satisfactory manner we would not be able to serve our customers well in either situation our business could incur significant costs and be adversely affected 

we are exposed to reputational risk and the risk of damage to our brands and the brands of our affiliates 

our success and results depend in part on our reputation and the strength of our brands we are vulnerable to adverse market perception as we operate in an industry where integrity customer trust and confidence are paramount we are exposed to the risk that litigation employee misconduct operational failures the outcome of regulatory or other investigations or actions press speculation and negative publicity among other factors could damage our brands or reputation our brands and reputation could also be harmed if we sell products or services that do not perform as expected or customers’ expectations for the product are not satisfied 

we may be adversely affected by unpredictable catastrophic events or terrorist attacks and our business continuity and disaster recovery plans may not adequately protect us from serious disaster 

the occurrence of catastrophic events such as hurricanes tropical storms tornadoes and other largescale catastrophes and terrorist attacks could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations if a catastrophe rendered both our production data center in rhode island and our recovery data center in north carolina unusable although we enhanced our disaster recovery capabilities in 2016 through the completion of the new outofregion backup data center in north carolina there can be no assurance that our current disaster recovery plans and capabilities will adequately protect us from serious disaster

an inability to realize the value of our deferred tax assets could adversely affect operating results 

our dtas are subject to an evaluation of whether it is more likely than not that they will be realized for financial statement purposes in making this determination we consider all positive and negative evidence available including the impact of recent operating results as well as potential carryback of tax to prior years’ taxable income if carryback is permitted under tax law reversals of existing taxable temporary differences tax planning strategies and projected earnings within the statutory tax loss carryover period we have determined that the dtas are more likely than not to be realized at december 31 2017 except for 105 million related to state net operating losses and state tax credits for which a valuation allowance was established if we were to conclude that a significant portion of the dtas were not more likely than not to be realized the required valuation allowance could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

we maintain a significant investment in projects that generate tax credits which we may not be able to fully utilize or if utilized may be subject to recapture or restructuring 

at december 31 2017 we maintained an investment of approximately 13 billion in entities for which we receive allocations of tax credits which we utilize to offset our taxable income we recognized 120 million in credits for the year ended december 31 2017 as of december 31 2017 all tax credits have been utilized to offset taxable income substantially all of these tax credits are related to development projects that are subject to ongoing compliance requirements over certain periods of time to fully realize their value if these projects are not operated in full compliance with the required terms the tax credits could be subject to recapture or restructuring further we may not be able to utilize any future tax credits if we are unable to utilize our tax credits or if our tax credits are subject to recapture or restructuring it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

any deterioration in national economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our business is affected by national economic conditions as well as perceptions of those conditions and future economic prospects changes in such economic conditions are not predictable and cannot be controlled adverse economic conditions could require us to charge off a higher percentage of loans and increase the provision for credit losses which would reduce our net income and otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations for example our business was significantly affected by the global economic and financial crisis that began in 2008 the falling home prices increased rate of foreclosure and high levels of unemployment in the united states triggered significant writedowns by us and other financial institutions these writedowns adversely impacted our financial results in material respects although the us economy continues to recover an interruption or reversal of this recovery would adversely affect the financial services industry and banking sector 

we operate in an industry that is highly competitive which could result in losing business or margin declines and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we operate in a highly competitive industry the industry could become even more competitive as a result of reform of the financial services industry resulting from the doddfrank act and other legislative regulatory and technological changes as well as continued consolidation we face aggressive competition from other domestic and foreign lending institutions and from numerous other providers of financial services including nonbanking financial institutions that are not subject to the same regulatory restrictions as banks and bank holding companies securities firms and insurance companies and competitors that may have greater financial resources 

with respect to nonbanking financial institutions technology and other changes have lowered barriers to entry and made it possible for nonbanks to offer products and services traditionally provided by banks for example consumers can maintain funds that would have historically been held as bank deposits in brokerage accounts or mutual funds consumers can also complete transactions such as paying bills andor transferring funds directly without the assistance of banks the process of eliminating banks as intermediaries known as “disintermediation” could result in the loss of fee income as well as the loss of customer deposits and the related income generated from those deposits some of our nonbank competitors are not subject to the same extensive regulations we are and therefore may have greater flexibility in competing for business as a result of these and other sources of

competition we could lose business to competitors or be forced to price products and services on less advantageous terms to retain or attract clients either of which would adversely affect our profitability and business 

the conditions of other financial institutions or of the financial services industry could adversely affect our operations and financial conditions 

financial services institutions are typically interconnected as a result of trading investment liquidity management clearing counterparty and other relationships within the financial services industry the default by any one institution could lead to defaults by other institutions concerns about or a default by one institution could lead to significant liquidity problems and losses or defaults by other institutions as the commercial and financial soundness of many financial institutions are closely related as a result of these credit trading clearing and other relationships even the perceived lack of creditworthiness of or questions about a counterparty may lead to marketwide liquidity problems and losses or defaults by various institutions this systemic risk may adversely affect financial intermediaries such as clearing agencies banks and exchanges with which we interact on a daily basis or key funding providers such as the fhlbs any of which could have a material adverse effect on our access to liquidity or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

risks related to regulations governing our industry 

as a financial holding company and a bank holding company we are subject to comprehensive regulation that could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

as a financial holding company and a bank holding company we are subject to comprehensive regulation supervision and examination by the frb in addition cbna is subject to comprehensive regulation supervision and examination by the occ and cbpa is subject to comprehensive regulation supervision and examination by the fdic and the pa banking department our regulators supervise us through regular examinations and other means that allow the regulators to gauge management’s ability to identify assess and control risk in all areas of operations in a safe and sound manner and to ensure compliance with laws and regulations in the course of their supervision and examinations our regulators may require improvements in various areas if we are unable to implement and maintain any required actions in a timely and effective manner we could become subject to informal nonpublic or formal public supervisory actions and public enforcement orders that could lead to significant restrictions on our existing business or on our ability to engage in any new business such forms of supervisory action could include without limitation written agreements cease and desist orders and consent orders and may among other things result in restrictions on our ability to pay dividends requirements to increase capital restrictions on our activities the imposition of civil monetary penalties and enforcement of such actions through injunctions or restraining orders we could also be required to dispose of certain assets and liabilities within a prescribed period the terms of any such supervisory or enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are a bank holding company that has elected to become a financial holding company pursuant to the bank holding company act financial holding companies are allowed to engage in certain financial activities in which a bank holding company is not otherwise permitted to engage however to maintain financial holding company status a bank holding company and all of its depository institution subsidiaries must be “well capitalized” and “well managed” if a bank holding company ceases to meet these capital and management requirements there are many penalties it would be faced with including i the frb may impose limitations or conditions on the conduct of its activities and ii it may not undertake any of the broader financial activities permissible for financial holding companies or acquire a company engaged in such financial activities without prior approval of the frb if a company does not return to compliance within 180 days which period may be extended the frb may require divestiture of that company’s depository institutions to the extent we do not meet the requirements to be a financial holding company in the future there could be a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we may be unable to disclose some restrictions or limitations on our operations imposed by our regulators 

from time to time bank regulatory agencies take supervisory actions that restrict or limit a financial institution’s activities and lead it to raise capital or subject it to other requirements directives issued to enforce such actions may be confidential and thus in some instances we are not permitted to publicly disclose these actions in addition as part of our regular examination process our and our banking subsidiaries’ respective regulators may advise us or our banking subsidiaries to operate under various restrictions as a prudential matter any such actions

risk factors 

or restrictions if and in whatever manner imposed could adversely affect our costs and revenues moreover efforts to comply with any such nonpublic supervisory actions or restrictions may require material investments in additional resources and systems as well as a significant commitment of managerial time and attention as a result such supervisory actions or restrictions if and in whatever manner imposed could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations and in certain instances we may not be able to publicly disclose these matters 

the regulatory environment in which we operate continues to be subject to significant and evolving regulatory requirements that could have a material adverse effect on our business and earnings 

we are heavily regulated by multiple banking consumer protection securities and other regulatory authorities at the federal and state levels this regulatory oversight is primarily established to protect depositors the fdic’s deposit insurance fund consumers of financial products and the financial system as a whole not security holders changes to statutes regulations rules or policies including the interpretation implementation or enforcement of statutes regulations rules or policies could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways including by for example subjecting us to additional costs limiting the types of financial services and other products we may offer limiting our ability to pursue acquisitions and increasing the ability of third parties including nonbanks to offer competing financial services and products in recent years we together with the rest of the financial services industry have faced particularly intense scrutiny with many new regulatory initiatives and vigorous oversight and enforcement on the part of numerous regulatory and governmental authorities legislatures and regulators have pursued a broad array of initiatives intended to promote the safety and soundness of financial institutions financial market stability the transparency and liquidity of financial markets and consumer and investor protection certain regulators and law enforcement authorities have also recently required admissions of wrongdoing and in some cases criminal pleas as part of the resolutions of matters brought by them against financial institutions any such resolution of a matter involving us could lead to increased exposure to civil litigation could adversely affect our reputation could result in penalties or limitations on our ability to do business or engage in certain activities and could have other negative effects in addition a single event or issue may give rise to numerous and overlapping investigations and proceedings including by multiple federal and state regulators and other governmental authorities 

we are also subject to laws and regulations relating to the privacy of the information of our customers employees counterparties and others and any failure to comply with these laws and regulations could expose us to liability andor reputational damage as new privacyrelated laws and regulations are implemented the time and resources needed for us to comply with those laws and regulations as well as our potential liability for noncompliance and our reporting obligations in the case of data breaches may significantly increase 

although the current administration and certain members of congress have indicated an intent to pursue reforms to the regulatory framework applicable to financial institutions the timing scope and impact of any such changes remains uncertain and it is possible that no such reforms will be implemented for more information on the regulations to which we are subject and recent initiatives to reform financial institution regulation see “regulation and supervision” in part i item 1 — business included in this report 

we are subject to capital adequacy and liquidity standards and if we fail to meet these standards our financial condition and operations would be adversely affected 

we are subject to several capital adequacy and liquidity standards to the extent that we are unable to meet these standards our ability to make distributions of capital will be limited and we may be subject to additional supervisory actions and limitations on our activities see “regulation and supervision” in part i item 1 —  business and “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations —  capital and regulatory requirements” and “ —  liquidity” in part ii item 7 included in this report for further discussion of the regulations to which we are subject 

we could be required to act as a “source of strength” to our banking subsidiaries which would have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

frb policy historically required bank holding companies to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to their subsidiary banks the doddfrank act codified this policy as a statutory requirement this support may be required by the frb at times when we might otherwise determine not to provide it or when doing so is not otherwise in the interests of cfg or our stockholders or creditors and may include one or more of the following

as a bank holding company we are a separate and distinct legal entity from our banking subsidiaries cbna and cbpa we typically receive substantially all of our revenue from dividends from our banking subsidiaries these dividends are the principal source of funds to pay dividends on our equity and interest and principal on our debt various federal andor state laws and regulations as well as regulatory expectations limit the amount of dividends that our banking subsidiaries may pay to us also our right to participate in a distribution of assets upon a subsidiary’s liquidation or reorganization is subject to the prior claims of the subsidiary’s creditors in the event cbna or cpba is unable to pay dividends to us we may not be able to service debt pay obligations or pay dividends on our common stock the inability to receive dividends from cbna or cpba could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations see “supervision and regulation” in part i item 1 —  business and “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations —  capital and regulatory matters” in part ii item 7 included in this report 

from timetotime we may become or are subject to regulatory actions that may have a material impact on our business 

we may become or are involved from time to time in reviews investigations and proceedings both formal and informal by governmental and selfregulatory agencies regarding our business these regulatory actions involve among other matters accounting compliance and operational matters certain of which may result in adverse judgments settlements fines penalties injunctions or other relief that may require changes to our business or otherwise materially impact our business 

in regulatory actions such as those referred to above it is inherently difficult to determine whether any loss is probable or whether it is possible to reasonably estimate the amount of any loss we cannot predict with certainty if how or when such proceedings will be resolved or what the eventual fine penalty or other relief conditions or restrictions if any may be particularly for actions that are in their early stages of investigation we may be required to make significant restitution payments to our banking subsidiaries’ customers arising from certain compliance issues and also may be required to pay civil money penalties in connection with certain of these issues this uncertainty makes it difficult to estimate probable losses which in turn can lead to substantial disparities between the reserves we may establish for such proceedings and the eventual settlements fines or penalties adverse regulatory actions could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are and may be subject to litigation that may have a material impact on our business 

our operations are diverse and complex and we operate in legal and regulatory environments that expose us to potentially significant litigation risk in the normal course of business we have been named from time to time as a defendant in various legal actions including arbitrations class actions and other litigation arising in connection with our activities as a financial services institution including with respect to alleged unfair or deceptive business practices and misselling of certain products certain of the actual or threatened legal actions include claims for substantial compensatory andor punitive damages or claims for indeterminate amounts of damages in some cases the entities that would otherwise be the primary defendants in such cases are bankrupt or in financial distress moreover a number of recent judicial decisions have upheld the right of borrowers to sue lending institutions on the basis of various evolving legal theories collectively termed “lender liability” generally lender liability is founded on the premise that a lender has either violated a duty whether implied or contractual of good faith and fair dealing owed to the borrower or has assumed a degree of control over the borrower resulting in the creation of a fiduciary duty owed to the borrower or its other creditors or stockholders this could increase the amount of

compliance with antimoney laundering and antiterrorism financing rules involve significant cost and effort 

we are subject to rules and regulations regarding money laundering and the financing of terrorism monitoring compliance with antimoney laundering and antiterrorism financing rules can put a significant financial burden on banks and other financial institutions and poses significant technical challenges although we believe our current policies and procedures are sufficient to comply with applicable rules and regulations we cannot guarantee that our antimoney laundering and antiterrorism financing policies and procedures completely prevent situations of money laundering or terrorism financing any such failure events may have severe consequences including sanctions fines and reputational consequences which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

we may become subject to more stringent regulatory requirements and activity restrictions or have to restructure if the frb and fdic jointly determine that our resolution plan is not credible   

current frb and fdic regulations require bank holding companies with more than 50 billion in assets to submit resolution plans that in the event of material financial distress or failure establish the rapid orderly and systemically safe liquidation of the company under the us bankruptcy code separately insured depository institutions with more than 50 billion in assets must submit to the fdic a resolution plan whereby they can be resolved in a manner that is orderly and that ensures that depositors will receive access to insured funds within certain required timeframes if the frb and the fdic jointly determine that the resolution plan of a bank holding company is not credible and the company fails to cure the deficiencies in a timely manner then the frb and the fdic may jointly impose on the company or on any of its subsidiaries more stringent capital leverage or liquidity requirements or restrictions on growth activities or operations or require the divestment of certain assets or operations if the frb and the fdic jointly determine that our resolution plan is not credible or would not facilitate our orderly resolution under the us bankruptcy code we could become subject to more stringent regulatory requirements or business restrictions or have to divest certain of our assets or businesses any such measures could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

risks related to our common stock 

our stock price may be volatile and you could lose all or part of your investment as a result 

you should consider an investment in our common stock to be risky and you should invest in our common stock only if you can withstand a significant loss and wide fluctuation in the market value of your investment the market price of our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to among other things the factors described in this “risk factors” section and other factors some of which are beyond our control these factors include 

 furthermore the stock markets have experienced price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market price of equity securities of many companies these fluctuations have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies 

citizens financial group inc 

risk factors 

these broad market fluctuations as well as general economic systemic political and market conditions such as recessions loss of investor confidence interest rate changes or international currency fluctuations may negatively affect the market price of our common stock 

if any of the foregoing occurs it could cause our stock price to fall and may expose us to securities class action litigation that even if unsuccessful could be costly to defend and a distraction to management 

we may not repurchase shares or pay cash dividends on our common stock 

holders of our common stock are only entitled to receive such dividends as our board of directors may declare out of funds legally available for such payments although we have historically declared cash dividends on our common stock we are not required to do so and may reduce or eliminate our common stock dividend in the future this could adversely affect the market price of our common stock also as a bank holding company our ability to repurchase shares and declare and pay dividends is dependent on certain federal regulatory considerations including the rules of the frb regarding capital adequacy and dividends additionally we are required to submit annual capital plans to the frb for review before we can take certain capital actions including repurchasing shares declaring and paying dividends or repurchasing or redeeming capital securities if our capital plan or any amendment to our capital plan is objected to for any reason our ability to repurchase shares and declare and pay dividends on our capital stock may be limited further if we are unable to satisfy the capital requirements applicable to us for any reason we may be limited in our ability to repurchase shares and declare and pay dividends on our capital stock see “regulation and supervision” in part i item 1 —  business included in this report for further discussion of the regulations to which we are subject 

“antitakeover” provisions and the regulations to which we are subject may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us even if the change in control would be beneficial to stockholders 

we are a bank holding company incorporated in the state of delaware antitakeover provisions in delaware law and our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws as well as regulatory approvals that would be required under federal law could make it more difficult for a third party to take control of us and may prevent stockholders from receiving a premium for their shares of our common stock these provisions could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and could reduce the amount that stockholders might get if we are sold 

we believe these provisions protect our stockholders from coercive or otherwise unfair takeover tactics by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with our board and by providing our board with more time to assess any acquisition proposal however these provisions apply even if the offer may be determined to be beneficial by some stockholders and could delay or prevent an acquisition that our board determines is not in our best interest and that of our stockholders 

furthermore banking laws impose notice approval and ongoing regulatory requirements on any stockholder or other party that seeks to acquire direct or indirect “control” of an fdicinsured depository institution these laws include the bank holding company act and the change in bank control act

key performance metrics used by management and nongaap financial measures 

as a banking institution we manage and evaluate various aspects of our results of operations and our financial condition we evaluate the levels and trends of the line items included in our balance sheet and statement of operations as well as various financial ratios that are commonly used in our industry we analyze these ratios and financial trends against our own historical performance our budgeted performance and the financial condition and performance of comparable banking institutions in our region and nationally 

the primary line items we use in our key performance metrics to manage and evaluate our statement of operations include net interest income noninterest income total revenue provision for credit losses noninterest expense net income and net income available to common stockholders the primary line items we use in our key performance metrics to manage and evaluate our balance sheet data include loans and leases securities allowance for credit losses deposits borrowed funds and derivatives 

in first quarter 2017 certain prior period noninterest income amounts reported in the consolidated statement of operations were reclassified to enhance transparency and provide additional granularity particularly with regard to fee income related to customer activity additionally student loans were renamed “education” loans to more closely align with the full range of services offered to borrowers from loan origination to refinancing these changes had no effect on net income total comprehensive income total assets or total stockholders’ equity as previously reported 

we consider various measures when evaluating our performance and making daytoday operating decisions as well as evaluating capital utilization and adequacy including 



citizens financial group inc 

management’s discussion and analysis 

 “adjusted” “underlying” or “adjustedunderlying” results which are nongaap measures exclude certain items as applicable that may occur in a reporting period which management does not consider indicative of ongoing financial performance 

we believe these nongaap measures provide useful information to investors because these are among the measures used by our management team to evaluate our operating performance and make daytoday operating decisions in addition we believe our “adjusted” “underlying” or “adjustedunderlying” results in any period reflect our operational performance in that period and accordingly it is useful to consider our gaap results and our “adjusted” “underlying” or “adjustedunderlying” results together we believe this presentation also increases comparability of periodtoperiod results 

other companies may use similarly titled nongaap financial measures that are calculated differently from the way we calculate such measures accordingly our nongaap financial measures may not be comparable to similar measures used by other companies we caution investors not to place undue reliance on such nongaap measures but instead to consider them with the most directly comparable gaap measure nongaap financial measures have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for our results as reported under gaap 

nongaap measures are denoted throughout “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” by the use of the term “adjusted” “underlying” or “adjustedunderlying” andor are followed by an asterisk

noninterest income 

the following table presents the significant components of our noninterest income 



1  in first quarter 2017 certain prior period noninterest income amounts reported in the consolidated statement of operations were reclassified to enhance transparency and provide additional granularity particularly with regard to fee income related to customer activity these changes had no effect on net income as previously reported 

2  includes net securities impairment losses on securities available for sale recognized in earnings bankowned life insurance income and other income 

noninterest income of 15 billion  in 2017  increase d 37 million  or 2  compared to 2016  driven by capital market fees card fees trust and investment service fees letter of credit and loan fees and foreign exchange and interest rate products partially offset by a reduction in service charges and fees securities gains mortgage banking fees and other income capital market fees increase d 58 million  reflecting underlying business momentum and the impact of building capabilities card fees increase d 30 million  from 2016  results service charges decrease d 6 million  and mortgage banking fees decrease d 4 million  from 2016  on an adjustedunderlying basis noninterest income increased 98 million or 7 compared to 2016 

provision for credit losses 

provision for credit losses of 321 million   decrease d 48 million  or 13  from 369 million  in 2016  the 48 million decrease was primarily due to continued asset quality improvement and the decline in net chargeoffs when compared to 2016 the 2017 results reflected a 16 million reserve build compared to a 34 million reserve build for the full year 2016 net chargeoffs for the full year 2017 of 305 million were 30 million lower compared to the full year 2016

income tax expense 

income tax expense was 260 million  and 489 million  in 2017  and 2016  respectively this resulted in an effective tax rate of 136  and 319  in 2017  and 2016  respectively the decrease in the effective income tax rate from 2016  to 2017  was primarily attributable to the revaluation of our deferred tax liability as a result of 2017 tax legislation 

at december 31 2017  we reported a net deferred tax liability of 571 million  compared to a 714 million  liability at december 31 2016  the decrease in the net deferred tax liability was primarily attributable to the revaluation of our deferred tax liability as a result of 2017 tax legislation 

on december 22 2017 president trump signed the 2017 tax legislation which included a reduction in the corporate tax rate from 35 to 21 for citizens this required a revaluation of our net deferred tax liability with a corresponding adjustment to current tax expense and resulted in a 331 million net tax benefit included in this net tax benefit was 145 million of expense related to the revaluation of our deferred tax assets associated with unrealized losses in aoci fasb standards inplace at december 31 2017 required us to revalue all deferred taxes including those related to balances in aoci through current tax expense as a result our unrealized loss balance in aoci was not revalued to reflect the new corporate tax rate this impact commonly referred to as the “stranded tax effect” was taken under consideration by fasb in january 2018 to address concerns primarily raised by banking institutions including distortion of net income and regulatory capital in february 2018 to address the “stranded tax effect” fasb issued asu 201802 income statementreporting comprehensive income topic 220 reclassification of certain tax effects from accumulated other comprehensive income  which provides entities the election to reclassify the difference between the new and old corporate tax rates resulting from the 2017 tax legislation between retained earnings and aoci for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2018 with early adoption permitted we have retrospectively adopted asu 201802 elected to reclassify 145 million between aoci and retained earnings including indirect impacts from the decreased federal tax effect on future state tax benefits and reflected this reclassification in our 2017 consolidated financial statements included in this report

management’s discussion and analysis 

provision for credit losses is allocated to each business operating segment based on actual net chargeoffs that have been recognized by the business operating segment the difference between the consolidated provision for credit losses and the business operating segments’ net chargeoffs is reflected in other 

noninterest income and expense directly managed by each business operating segment including fees service charges salaries and benefits and other direct revenues and costs are accounted for within each business operating segment’s financial results in a manner similar to our consolidated financial statements occupancy costs are allocated based on utilization of facilities by the business operating segment noninterest expenses incurred by centrally managed operations or business operating segments that directly support another business operating segment’s operations are charged to the applicable business operating segment based on its utilization of those services 

income taxes are assessed to each business operating segment at a standard tax rate with the residual tax expense or benefit to arrive at the consolidated effective tax rate included in other 

developing and applying methodologies used to allocate items among the business operating segments is a dynamic process accordingly financial results may be revised periodically as management systems are enhanced methods of evaluating performance or product lines change or our organizational structure changes

management’s discussion and analysis 

noninterest expense of 34 billion in 2016 increased 93 million or 3 compared to 2015 as the impact of higher salaries and employee benefits amortization of software equipment expense and outside services expense was partially offset by lower occupancy and other operating expense results in 2016 reflected the impact of 36 million of notable items compared with 50 million of restructuring charges and special items in 2015  excluding the impact of restructuring charges special items and notable items adjusted noninterest expense increased 107 million driven by higher salaries and employee benefits as the impact of continued investment in strategic growth initiatives and revenue based incentives were partially offset by the benefit of our efficiency initiatives results also reflect increased software amortization expense outside services expense and equipment expense partially offset by lower other operating expense 

income tax expense 

income tax expense was 489 million  and 423 million  in 2016  and 2015  respectively this resulted in an effective tax rate of 319  and 335  in 2016  and 2015  respectively the decrease in the effective income tax rate from 2015  to 2016  was primarily attributable to the impact of federal and state tax credits 

at december 31 2016  we reported a net deferred tax liability of 714 million  compared to a 730 million  liability at december 31 2015  the decrease in the net deferred tax liability was primarily attributable to the tax effect of net unrealized losses on securities and derivatives arising during the period largely offset by the tax effect of current year timing adjustments for further discussion see note 22 “income taxes” to our consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 — financial statements and supplementary data included in this report

potential problem loans and leases 

at december 31 2017  we did not identify any potential problem loans or leases within the portfolio that were not already included in “—risk elements” potential problem loans or leases consist of loans and leases where information about a borrower’s possible credit problems cause management to have serious doubts as to the ability of such borrowers to comply with the present repayment terms 

commercial loan asset quality 

our commercial loan and lease portfolio consists of traditional commercial loans commercial leases and commercial real estate loans the portfolio is predominantly focused on customers in our footprint and adjacent states in which we have a physical presence where our local delivery model provides for strong client connectivity additionally we also do business in certain specialized industry sectors on a national basis 

citizens financial group inc 

management’s discussion and analysis 

for commercial loans and leases we use regulatory classification ratings to monitor credit quality loans with a “pass” rating are those that we believe will be fully repaid in accordance with the contractual loan terms commercial loans and leases that are “criticized” are those that have some weakness that indicates an increased probability of future loss see note 5 “allowance for credit losses nonperforming assets and concentrations of credit risk” to our audited consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 — financial statements and supplementary data included in this report 

nonperforming commercial loans and leases decreased   122 million  to 265 million  as of december 31 2017  from 387 million  as of december 31 2016  largely tied to commoditiesrelated credits as of december 31 2017  total commercial nonperforming loans were 05  of the commercial loan portfolio compared to 07  as of december 31 2016  total 2017  commercial loan and lease portfolio net chargeoffs of 35 million  decreased from 46 million  in 2016  largely reflecting higher recovery levels 

total commercial criticized loans and leases of 28 billion  or 54  of total loans and leases as of december 31 2017  decreased from 29 billion  or 56  at december 31 2016  commercial criticized balances of 21 billion  or 57  of commercial loans as of december 31 2017  decreased from 23 billion  or 61  as of december 31 2016  largely driven by commoditiesrelated credits commercial real estate criticized balances of 602 million  or 53  of the commercial real estate portfolio increased from 478 million  or 45  as of december 31 2016  driven by multifamily and office property types commercial criticized loans represented 75  of total criticized loans as of december 31 2017  compared to 78  as of december 31 2016  commercial real estate accounted for 21  of total criticized loans as of december 31 2017  compared to 16  as of december 31 2016  

retail loan asset quality 

for retail loans we primarily utilize payment and delinquency status to regularly review and monitor credit quality trends historical experience indicates that the longer a loan is past due the greater the likelihood of future credit loss the largest portion of the retail portfolio is represented by borrowers located in the new england midatlantic and midwest regions although we have continued to grow selectively in areas outside the footprint primarily in the auto finance education lending and unsecured portfolios 

the credit composition of our retail loan portfolio at december 31 2017  reflected an average refreshed fico score of 762 which was slightly improved compared to december 31 2016  the real estate secured portfolio cltv ratio is calculated as the mortgage and second lien loan balance divided by the most recently available value of the property and was 59 as of december 31 2017  and 62  as of december 31 2016  retail asset quality continued to improve with a net chargeoff rate of 047  for the year ended december 31 2017  a decrease of six  basis points from the year ended december 31 2016  driven by improving asset quality and shift in portfolio mix 

heloc payment shock 

we monitor the potential for increased exposure to credit losses associated with helocs that were originated during the period of rapid home price appreciation between 2003 and 2007 industry wide many of the helocs originated during this timeframe were structured with an extended interestonly payment period followed by a requirement to convert to a higher payment amount that would begin fully amortizing both principal and interest beginning at a certain date in the future to help manage this potential exposure we launched a comprehensive program in september 2013 designed to provide heightened customer outreach to inform educate and assist customers through the reset process as well as to offer alternative financing and forbearance options results of this program indicate that our efforts to assist customers at risk of default have successfully reduced delinquency and chargeoff rates compared to our original expectations 

as of december 31 2017  for the 17 billion of our heloc portfolio that reached the end of the interestonly draw period and entered repayment of principal and interest during 2014 and 2015 94 of the balances had been refinanced paid off or were current on payments 3 were past due and 3 had been charged off as of december 31 2017  for the 738 million  of our heloc portfolio that reached the end of the interestonly draw period and entered repayment of principal and interest in 2016 95 of the balances had been refinanced paid off or were current on payments 3 were past due and 2 had been charged off as of december 31 2017  for the 730 million of our heloc portfolio that reached the end of the interestonly draw period and entered repayment of principal and interest in 2017 94 of the balances had been refinanced paid off or were current on payments 5 were past due and 1 had been charged off 

as of december 31 2017 a total of 10 billion of heloc balances were scheduled to reach the end of the interestonly draw period and enter repayment of principal and interest in 2018 for the 32 billion heloc portfolio scheduled to reach the end of the interestonly draw period and enter repayment of principal and interest between

january 1 2018 and december 31 2021 49 was secured by a first lien with a weightedaverage fico score of the borrowers of 763 and a ltv ratio of 56 these results compare to the total heloc portfolio of 136 billion that was 51 secured by a first lien with a weightedaverage fico score of the borrowers of 768 and a ltv ratio of 58 factors that affect our future expectations for continued relatively low chargeoff risk in the face of rising interest rates for the portion of our heloc portfolio subject to reset in future periods include a relatively high level of first lien collateral positions improved loantovalue ratios resulting from continued home price appreciation relatively stable portfolio credit score profiles and continued robust loss mitigation efforts 

troubled debt restructurings 

tdr is the classification given to a loan that has been restructured in a manner that grants a concession to a borrower experiencing financial hardship that we would not otherwise make tdrs typically result from our loss mitigation efforts and are undertaken in order to improve the likelihood of recovery and continuity of the relationship our loan modifications are handled on a casebycase basis and are negotiated to achieve mutually agreeable terms that maximize loan collectability and meet our borrower’s financial needs the types of concessions include interest rate reductions term extensions principal forgiveness and other modifications to the structure of the loan that fall outside our lending policy depending on the specific facts and circumstances of the customer restructuring can involve loans moving to nonaccrual remaining on nonaccrual or remaining on accrual status 

as of december 31 2017  761 million  of retail loans were classified as tdrs compared with 799 million  as of december 31 2016  the decrease was in part attributable to a fourth quarter 2017 tdr loan sale of 78 million as of december 31 2017  211 million  of retail tdrs were in nonaccrual status with 51 current with payments an improvement compared to 233 million in nonaccrual status with 55 current on payments at december 31 2016  tdrs generally return to accrual status once repayment capacity and appropriate payment history can be established tdrs are individually evaluated for impairment and loans once classified as tdrs remain classified as tdrs until paid off sold or refinanced at market terms

crossborder outstandings 

crossborder outstandings can include loans receivables interestbearing deposits with other banks other interestbearing investments and other monetary assets that are denominated in either dollars or other nonlocal currency 

as of december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  there were no aggregate crossborder outstandings from borrowers or counterparties in any country that exceeded 1 or were between 075 and 1 of consolidated total assets 

derivatives 

in the normal course of business we enter into a variety of derivative transactions in order to meet the financing needs of our customers and to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates these transactions include interest rate swap contracts interest rate options foreign exchange contracts residential loan commitment rate locks forward sale contracts and purchase options the assets and liabilities for derivatives on the consolidated balance sheets reflect the market value of these transactions we designate certain derivatives as hedging instruments in a qualifying hedge accounting relationship fair value or cash flow hedge our remaining derivatives consist of economic hedges that do not qualify for hedge accounting and derivatives held for customer accommodation trading or other purposes we monitor the results of each transaction to ensure that management’s intent is satisfied we do not use derivatives for speculative purposes for additional information regarding our derivative instruments see note 13 “derivatives” in our audited consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 — financial statements and supplementary data included in this report 

the table below presents our derivative assets and liabilities 



1 the notional or contractual amount of interest rate derivatives and foreign exchange contracts is the amount upon which interest and other payments under the contract are based for interest rate derivatives the notional amount is typically not exchanged therefore notional amounts should not be taken as the measure of credit or market risk as they do not measure the true economic risk of these contracts 

2  amounts reflect changes in the treatment of variation margin on certain centrally cleared derivatives 

3 amounts represent the impact of enforceable master netting agreements that allow us to net settle positive and negative positions 

at december 31 2017  the total derivative net asset value decreased   10 million  and the total net liability value decreased  by 349 million  from december 31 2016  driven by a change in the presentation of variation margin payments in the consolidated balance sheets in 2017 effective january 3 2017 variation margin payments made on certain centrallycleared derivative contracts were classified as settlement of those derivatives rather than the

management’s discussion and analysis 

posting of collateral as a result of this change on a prospective basis we modified our balance sheet presentation of certain interest rate swaps in 2017 such that the fair value of the swaps and the associated variation margin balances are reported as a single unit of account in derivative assets andor derivative liabilities at december 31 2016 these variation margin balances were characterized as collateral variation margin balances characterized as collateral are reported in interestbearing cash and due from banks on the consolidated balance sheets 

derivatives designated as hedging instruments 

we use interest rate swap contracts to manage the interest rate exposure to variability in the interest cash flows on our floating rate assets and floating rate wholesale funding and to hedge market risk on fixed rate capital markets debt issuances the table below summarizes the related hedging activities 



1  we use receivefixed swaps to minimize the exposure to variability in the interest cash flows on our floating rate assets 

2  we use receivefixed swaps to hedge market risk on fixed rate capital markets debt issuances 

3  we use payfixed swaps to hedge floating rate wholesale funding 

during 2017 we increased our hedge position related to our floating rate commercial loans through the net addition of 13 billion in receivefixed swaps to limit our exposure to declining interest rates an additional 12 billion in receivefixed swap were entered into during the year related to the fixed rate senior term debt issued this further reduced our exposure to declining interest rates we also reduced our position by a net 25 billion in payfixed swaps during the year related to our floating rate wholesale funding activities 

derivatives not designated as hedging instruments 

   we enter into derivative contracts including foreign exchange contracts and interest rate contracts for the benefit of commercial customers and other business purposes we economically hedge significant exposures related to these freestanding derivatives by entering into offsetting thirdparty contracts with approved reputable and independent counterparties with substantially matching terms and currencies credit risk arises from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts our exposure is limited to the replacement value of the contracts rather than the notional principal or contract amounts credit risk is minimized through credit approvals limits counterparty collateral and monitoring procedures we also uses forward commitments to sell tbas and other commitments to sell residential mortgage loans at specified prices to economically hedge the interest rate risk in its residential mortgage loan activities including residential loan commitment rate locks

capital framework 

under the us basel iii capital framework we and our banking subsidiaries must meet specific minimum requirements for the following ratios common equity tier 1 capital tier 1 capital total capital and tier 1 leverage 

the us adoption of the basel iii standardized approach by the federal banking regulators became effective for cfg cbna and cbpa on january 1 2015 subject to a phasein period for certain provisions in november 2017 the federal banking regulators issued a final rule that extended the 2017 transition provisions for certain us basel iii capital rules for nonadvanced approaches banking organizations such as us effective january 1 2018 the final rule retains the 2017 us basel iii transitional treatment of certain dtas mortgage servicing assets investments in nonconsolidated financial entities and minority interests as a result effective january 1 2018 our mortgage servicing assets will retain their 2017 risk weight treatment until the federal banking regulators revise the extended transitional treatment under the november 2017 final rule which may occur in connection with the finalization of the related september 2017 proposal to simplify the capital treatment of certain dtas mortgage servicing assets investments in nonconsolidated financial entities and minority interests 

the us basel iii rules also impose a ccb on top of the following three minimum riskweighted asset ratios cet1 capital of 45 tier 1 capital of 60 and total capital of 80 the implementation of the ccb began on january 1 2016 at the 0625 level and increases by 0625 on each subsequent january 1 until the buffer reaches its fully phasedin level of 25 on january 1 2019 as such the ccb for 2017 increased to 1250 on january 1 2017 banking institutions for which any riskweighted asset ratio falls below its effective minimum required minimum ratios plus the applicable ccb will be subject to constraints on capital distributions including dividends share repurchases and certain discretionary executive compensation the severity of the constraints depends on the amount of the shortfall

standardized approach 

cfg cbna and cbpa calculate regulatory ratios using the us basel iii standardized approach which prescribe many categories of assets and depending on the nature of the assets generally risk weight in a range from 0 for us government and agency securities to 600 for certain equity exposures under this approach no distinction is made for variations in credit quality for corporate exposures additionally the economic benefit of collateral is restricted to a limited list of eligible securities and cash at december 31 2017 we estimate our cet1 capital cet1 capital ratio and total riskweighted assets using the us basel iii standardized approach on a fully phasedin basis to be 143 billion  112  and 1280 billion  respectively 

the following table provides a reconciliation of regulatory ratios and ratio components using the us basel iii standardized transitional rules and us basel iii standardized estimates on a fully phasedin basis for common equity tier 1 capital total capital and riskweighted assets this reconciliation applies the original transition provision effective january 1 2015 effective january 1 2018 us basel iii ratio definitions impacting risk weighted assets and qualifying us basel iii capital will be fully phasedin per the final transition provision rule issued by banking regulators in november 2017

riskweighted assets “rwa” totaled 1277 billion  at december 31 2017  based on us basel iii standardized transitional rules up   38 billion  from december 31 2016  this increase was driven by growth in retail loans including education residential mortgages and unsecured personal loans as well as commercial real estate loans and unfunded commercial commitment rwa included within the commercial real estate loan rwa increase was approximately 700 million tied to a change in the rwa designation for certain commercial real estate loans in first quarter 2017 these increases were partially offset by the rwa impact of runoff in the home equity and auto portfolios and a reduction in market risk as we have not met the reporting threshold prescribed by market risk capital guidelines since the first quarter of 2017 the tier 1 leverage ratio of 100 at december 31 2017  increased seven basis points from december 31 2016  driven by a 34 basis point increase from higher cet1 capital as described above largely offset by an increase of 39 billion in total average consolidated assets that drove a 27 basis point decline in the ratio

our assessment of capital adequacy begins with our risk appetite and risk management framework this framework provides for the identification measurement and management of material risks capital requirements are determined for actual and forecasted risk portfolios using applicable regulatory capital methodologies the assessment also considers the possible impacts of approved and proposed regulatory changes to future periods key analytical frameworks which enable the assessment of capital adequacy versus unexpected loss supplement our base case forecast these supplemental frameworks include stress testing as well as an internal capital adequacy requirement that builds on internally assessed economic capital requirements a robust governance framework supports our capital planning process this process includes capital management policies and procedures that document capital adequacy metrics and limits as well as our comprehensive capital contingency plan and the active engagement of both the legalentity boards and senior management in oversight and decisionmaking

management’s discussion and analysis 

forwardlooking assessments of capital adequacy for us and our banking subsidiaries feed development of capital plans that are submitted to the frb and bank regulators we prepare these plans in compliance with the frb’s capital plan rule and participate annually in the frb’s ccar review process in addition to the stress test requirements under ccar we also perform semiannual companyrun stress tests required by the doddfrank act   

all distributions proposed under our capital plan are subject to consideration and approval by our board of directors prior to execution the timing and exact amount of future dividends and share repurchases will depend on various factors including our capital position financial performance and market conditions

 banking subsidiaries’ capital 

the following table presents our banking subsidiaries’ capital ratios under us basel iii standardized transitional rules 



1 “common equity tier 1 capital ratio” is cet1 capital divided by total riskweighted assets as defined under us basel iii standardized approach 

2 “tier 1 capital ratio” is tier 1 capital which includes cet1 capital plus noncumulative perpetual preferred equity that qualifies as additional tier 1 capital divided by total riskweighted assets as defined under us basel iii standardized approach 

3 “total capital ratio” is total capital divided by total riskweighted assets as defined under us basel iii standardized approach 

4  “tier 1 leverage ratio” is tier 1 capital divided by quarterly average total assets as defined under us basel iii standardized approach 

cbna cet1 capital totaled 119 billion  at december 31 2017  up 669 million  from 112 billion  at december 31 2016  as net income of 14 billion including the effect of the 2017 tax legislation of 280 million was largely offset by dividend payments at december 31 2017  cbna held minimal additional tier 1 capital total capital was 141 billion  at december 31 2017  an increase  of 684 million  from december 31 2016  primarily driven by the increases in cet1 capital 

cbna riskweighted assets of 1048 billion  at december 31 2017  increased 43 billion  from december 31 2016  driven by growth in retail loans including education residential mortgages and unsecured personal loans as well as commercial real estate loans and unfunded commercial commitment rwa included within the commercial real estate loan rwa increase was approximately 400 million tied to a change in the rwa designation for certain commercial real estate loans in first quarter 2017 these increases were partially offset by the rwa impact of run

off in the home equity and auto portfolios and a reduction in market risk as cbna has not met the reporting threshold prescribed by market risk capital guidelines in 2017 

the cbna tier 1 leverage ratio of 103  at december 31 2017  increased seven basis points from december 31 2016  driven by a 59 basis point increase from higher cet1 capital as described above largely offset by a 58 billion  increase in total average consolidated assets that drove a 52 basis point decline in the ratio 

cbpa cet1 capital totaled 30 billion  at december 31 2017  and decreased   49 million  from 31 billion  at december 31 2016  as dividend payments of 285 million were largely offset by net income of 328 million including the effect of the 2017 tax legislation of 74 million at december 31 2017  there was no additional tier 1 capital total capital was 33 billion  at december 31 2017  a decrease  of 49 million  from december 31 2016  driven by the decrease in cet1 capital as described above 

cbpa riskweighted assets of 237 billion  at december 31 2017   decreased   767 million  from december 31 2016  driven by decreases in auto commercial residential mortgage and home equity rwa these decreases were partially offset by growth in commercial real estate and education loan rwa included within the commercial real estate loan rwa increase was approximately 300 million tied to a change of the rwa designation for certain commercial real estate loans in first quarter 2017 

the cbpa tier 1 leverage ratio of 87  at december 31 2017   decreased   eight  basis points from   december 31 2016  driven by a 14 basis point decrease from lower cet1 capital as described above offset by a 236 million   decrease  in total average consolidated assets that drove a six basis point increase in the ratio 

liquidity 

liquidity is defined as our ability to meet our cashflow and collateral obligations in a timely manner at a reasonable cost an institution must maintain operating liquidity to meet its expected daily and forecasted cashflow requirements as well as contingent liquidity to meet unexpected stress scenario funding requirements as noted earlier reflecting the importance of meeting all unexpected and stressscenario funding requirements we identify and manage contingent liquidity consisting of cash balances at the frb unencumbered highquality and liquid securities and unused fhlb borrowing capacity separately we also identify and manage asset liquidity as a subset of contingent liquidity consisting of cash balances at the frb and unencumbered highquality securities we consider the effective and prudent management of liquidity to be fundamental to our health and strength 

we manage liquidity at the consolidated enterprise level and at each material legal entity including at the parent company cbna and cbpa 

parent company liquidity 

our parent company’s primary sources of cash are i dividends and interest received from our banking subsidiaries as a result of investing in bank equity and subordinated debt and ii externally issued senior and subordinated debt uses of liquidity include the following i routine cash flow requirements as a bank holding company including periodic share repurchases and payments of dividends interest and expenses ii needs of subsidiaries including banking subsidiaries for additional equity and as required their needs for debt financing and iii support for extraordinary funding requirements when necessary 

during the years ended december 31 2017   and 2016  the parent company paid dividends on common stock of 322 million  and 241 million  respectively and declared dividends on preferred stock of 14 million  for both periods during the years ended december 31 2017  and 2016  the parent company repurchased 820 million  and 430 million  of its outstanding common stock respectively 

our parent company’s cash and cash equivalents represent a source of liquidity that can be used to meet various needs and totaled 443 million  as of december 31 2017  compared with 551 million  as of december 31 2016  the parent company’s doubleleverage ratio the combined equity of parent company subsidiaries divided by parent company equity is a measure of reliance on equity cash flows from subsidiaries at december 31 2017  the parent company’s doubleleverage ratio was 103  

banking subsidiaries’ liquidity 

in the ordinary course of business the liquidity of cbna and cbpa is managed by matching sources and uses of cash the primary sources of bank liquidity include i deposits from our consumer and commercial franchise customers ii payments of principal and interest on loans and debt securities and iii wholesale borrowings as needed and as described under “—liquidity risk management and governance” the primary uses of bank liquidity 

citizens financial group inc 

management’s discussion and analysis 

include i withdrawals and maturities of deposits ii payment of interest on deposits iii funding of loans and related commitments and iv funding of securities purchases to the extent that the banks have relied on wholesale borrowings uses also include payments of related principal and interest 

our banking subsidiaries’ major businesses involve taking deposits and making loans hence a key role of liquidity management is to ensure that customers have timely access to funds from deposits and loans liquidity management also involves maintaining sufficient liquidity to repay wholesale borrowings pay operating expenses and support extraordinary funding requirements when necessary 

from an external issuance perspective on february 24 2017 we increased the size of cbna’s global note program from 50 billion to 80 billion on march 2 2017 cbna issued 10 billion in threeyear senior notes consisting of 700 million in fixedrate notes and 300 million in floatingrate notes on may 26 2017 cbna issued 15 billion in senior notes consisting of 500 million of threeyear fixedrate notes 250 million of threeyear floatingrate notes 500 million in fiveyear fixedrate notes and 250 million in fiveyear floatingrate notes on november 1 2017 cbna issued 750 million in threeyear senior notes 

liquidity risk 

we define liquidity risk as the risk that an entity will be unable to meet its payment obligations in a timely manner at a reasonable cost we manage liquidity risk at the consolidated enterprise level and at the legal entity level including at the parent company cbna and cbpa liquidity risk can arise due to contingent liquidity risk andor funding liquidity risk 

contingent liquidity risk is the risk that market conditions may reduce an entity’s ability to liquidate pledge andor finance certain assets and thereby substantially reduce the liquidity value of such assets drivers of contingent liquidity risk include general market disruptions as well as specific issues regarding the credit quality andor valuation of a security or loan issuer or borrower andor asset class 

funding liquidity risk is the risk that market conditions andor entityspecific events may reduce an entity’s ability to raise funds from depositors andor wholesale market counterparties drivers of funding liquidity risk may be idiosyncratic or systemic reflecting impediments to operations andor damaged market confidence 

factors affecting liquidity 

given the composition of their assets and borrowing sources contingent liquidity risk at both cbna and cbpa would be materially affected by such events as deterioration of financing markets for highquality securities eg mortgagebacked securities and other instruments issued by the gnma fnma and the fhlmc by any inability of the fhlbs to provide collateralized advances andor by a refusal of the frb to act as lender of last resort in systemic stress 

similarly given the structure of their balance sheets the funding liquidity risk of cbna and cbpa would be materially affected by an adverse idiosyncratic event eg a major loss causing a perceived or actual deterioration in its financial condition an adverse systemic event eg default or bankruptcy of a significant capital markets participant or a combination of both eg the financial crisis of 20082010 however during the financial crisis our banking subsidiaries reduced their dependence on unsecured wholesale funding to virtually zero consequently and despite ongoing exposure to a variety of idiosyncratic and systemic events we view our contingent liquidity risk and our funding liquidity risk to be relatively modest 

citizens financial group inc 

management’s discussion and analysis 

an additional variable affecting our access and the access of our banking subsidiaries to unsecured wholesale market funds and to large denomination ie uninsured customer deposits is the credit ratings assigned by such agencies as moody’s standard  poor’s and fitch the following table presents our credit ratings 



changes in our public credit ratings could affect both the cost and availability of our wholesale funding as a result and in order to maintain a conservative funding profile our banking subsidiaries continue to minimize reliance on unsecured wholesale funding at december 31 2017  our wholesale funding consisted primarily of secured borrowings from the fhlbs collateralized by highquality residential mortgages and term debt issued by the parent company and cbna 

existing and evolving regulatory liquidity requirements such as the lcr and nsfr represent another key driver of systemic liquidity conditions and liquidity management practices the frb the occ and the fdic regularly evaluate our liquidity as part of the overall supervisory process 

the lcr was developed to ensure banks have sufficient highquality liquid assets to cover expected net cash outflows over a 30day liquidity stress period in september 2014 the us federal banking regulators published the final rule to implement the lcr this rule also introduced a modified version of the lcr in the us which generally applies to bank holding companies not active internationally institutions with less than 10 billion of onbalance sheet foreign exposure with total assets of greater than 50 billion but less than 250 billion under this definition we are designated as a modified lcr financial institution and were 100 compliant beginning in january 2017 achieving sustainable lcr compliance may require changes in the size andor composition of our investment portfolio the configuration of our discretionary wholesale funding portfolio and our average cash position we remain fully compliant with the lcr as of december 31 2017  

the us federal bank regulatory agencies have issued a notice of proposed rulemaking to implement the nsfr along with a modified version with similar parameters as the lcr that would designate us as a modified nsfr financial institution the nsfr is one of the two basel iiibased liquidity measures distinctly separate from the lcr and is designed to promote medium and longterm stable funding of the assets and offbalance sheet activities of banks and bank holding companies over a oneyear time horizon generally consistent with the basel committee’s framework under the proposed rule banking organizations would be required to hold an amount of available stable funding “asf” over a oneyear time horizon that equals or exceeds the institution’s amount of required stable funding “rsf” with the asf representing the numerator and the rsf representing the denominator of the nsfr the banking organizations subject to the modified nsfr would multiply the rsf amount by 70 such that the rsf amount required for these companies would be required to maintain asf of at least 70 of its rsf generally these modified nsfr companies are defined as institutions with total assets of greater than 50 billion but less than 250 billion and less than 10 billion of onbalance sheet foreign exposure the proposed rule includes detailed descriptions of the items that would comprise asf and rsf and standardized factors that would apply to asf and rsf items and would require any institution whose applicable modified nsfr falls under 100 to notify the appropriate federal regulator and develop a remediation plan 

citizens financial group inc 

management’s discussion and analysis 

we are currently evaluating the impact of the us federal bank regulatory agencies’ nsfr framework if ultimately adopted as currently proposed the implementation of the nsfr could impact our liquidity and funding requirements and practices in the future 

we continue to review and monitor these liquidity requirements to develop appropriate implementation plans and liquidity strategies we expect to be fully compliant with the final rules on or prior to their applicable effective date 

liquidity risk management and governance 

liquidity risk is measured and managed by the funding and liquidity unit within our treasury unit in accordance with policy guidelines promulgated by our board and the asset and liability management committee in managing liquidity risk the funding and liquidity unit delivers regular and comprehensive reporting including current levels versus threshold limits for a broad set of liquidity metrics and early warning indicators explanatory commentary relating to emerging risk trends and as appropriate recommended remedial strategies 

the mission of our funding and liquidity unit is to deliver and otherwise maintain prudent levels of operating liquidity to support expected and projected funding requirements and contingent liquidity to support unexpected funding requirements resulting from idiosyncratic systemic and combination stress events and regulatory liquidity requirements additionally we will deliver this liquidity from stable funding sources in a timely manner and at a reasonable cost without significant adverse consequences 

we seek to accomplish this mission by funding loans with stable deposits by prudently controlling dependence on wholesale funding particularly shortterm unsecured funding and by maintaining ample available liquidity including a contingent liquidity buffer of unencumbered highquality loans and securities as of december 31 2017  

 the funding and liquidity unit monitors a variety of liquidity and funding metrics and early warning indicators and metrics including specific risk thresholds limits these monitoring tools are broadly classified as follows 

 further certain of these metrics are monitored individually for our banking subsidiaries and for our consolidated enterprise on a daily basis including cash position unencumbered securities asset liquidity and available fhlb borrowing capacity in order to identify emerging trends and risks and inform funding decisions specific metrics are also forecasted over a oneyear horizon 

cash flows from operating activities contributed 19 billion  in 2017  led by net income of 17 billion  proceeds from sales of mortgage loans held for sale of 32 billion  and proceeds from sales of commercial loans held for sale of 20 billion  partially offset by originations of mortgage loans held for sale of 29 billion  and purchases of commercial loans held for sale of 21 billion  net cash used by investing activities was 40 billion  primarily reflecting a net increase in loans and leases of 36 billion  and securities available for sale portfolio purchases of 54 billion  partially offset by proceeds from maturities paydowns and sales of securities available for sale of 47 billion  cash provided by financing activities was 14 billion  driven by proceeds from issuance of longterm borrowed funds of 154 billion  and a net increase in deposits of 53 billion  partially offset by repayments

critical accounting estimates 

our audited consolidated financial statements which are included in this report are prepared in accordance with gaap the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to establish accounting policies and make estimates that affect amounts reported in our audited consolidated financial statements 

an accounting estimate requires assumptions and judgments about uncertain matters that could have a material effect on our audited consolidated financial statements estimates are made using facts and circumstances known at a point in time changes in those facts and circumstances could produce results substantially different from those estimates the most significant accounting policies and estimates and their related application are discussed below 

see note 1 “basis of presentation” to our audited consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 — financial statements and supplementary data included in this report for further discussion of our significant accounting policies 

allowance for credit losses 

management’s estimate of probable losses in our loan and lease portfolios including unfunded lending commitments is recorded in the alll and the reserve for unfunded lending commitments at levels that we believe to be appropriate as of the balance sheet date the reserve for unfunded lending commitments is reported as a component of other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets our determination of such estimates is based on a periodic evaluation of the loan and lease portfolios and unfunded credit facilities as well as other relevant factors this evaluation is inherently subjective and requires significant estimates and judgments of underlying factors all of which are susceptible to change 

the alll and reserve for unfunded lending commitments could be affected by a variety of internal and external factors internal factors include portfolio performance such as delinquency levels assigned risk ratings the mix and level of loan balances differing economic risks associated with each loan category and the financial condition of specific borrowers external factors include fluctuations in the general economy unemployment rates bankruptcy filings developments within a particular industry changes in collateral values and factors particular to a specific commercial credit such as competition business and management performance the alll may be adjusted to reflect our current assessment of various qualitative risks factors and events that may not be measured in our statistical procedures there is no certainty that the alll and reserve for unfunded lending commitments will be appropriate over time to cover losses because of unanticipated adverse changes in any of these internal external or qualitative factors 

the evaluation of the adequacy of the commercial commercial real estate and lease alll and reserve for unfunded lending commitments is primarily based on risk rating models that assess probability of default “pd” loss given default “lgd” and exposure at default on an individual loan basis the models are primarily driven by individual customer financial characteristics and are validated against historical experience additionally qualitative factors may be included in the risk rating models after the aggregation of individual borrower incurred loss additional overlays can be made based on backtesting against historical losses and forward loss curve ratios 

for nonaccruing commercial and commercial real estate loans with an outstanding balance of 3 million or greater and for all commercial and commercial real estate tdrs regardless of size we conduct specific analysis on a loan level basis to determine the probable amount of credit loss if appropriate a specific alll is established for the loan through a charge to the provision for credit losses for all classes of impaired loans individual loan measures of impairment may result in a chargeoff to the alll if deemed appropriate in such cases the provision for credit losses is not affected when a specific reserve for at least that amount already exists techniques utilized include comparing the loan’s carrying amount to the estimated present value of its future cash flows the fair value of its underlying collateral or the loan’s observable market price the technique applied to each impaired loan is based on the workout officer’s opinion of the most probable workout scenario historically this has generally led to the use of the estimated present value of future cash flows approach the fair value of underlying collateral will be used if the loan is deemed collateral dependent for loans that use the fair value of underlying collateral approach a chargeoff assessment is performed quarterly to write the loans down for declines in value to fair value less cost to sell 

for most nonimpaired retail loan portfolio types the alll is based upon the incurred loss model utilizing the pd lgd and exposure at default on an individual loan basis when developing these factors we may consider the loan product and collateral type delinquency status ltv ratio lien position borrower’s credit time outstanding 

citizens financial group inc 

management’s discussion and analysis 

geographic location and incurred loss period incurred loss periods are reviewed and updated at least annually and potentially more frequently when economic situations change rapidly as they tend to fluctuate with economic cycles incurred loss periods are generally longer in good economic times and shorter in bad times certain retail portfolios including sbo home equity loans and credit card receivables utilize roll rate models to estimate the alll for the portfolios measured using the incurred loss model roll rate models are also used to support management overlays if deemed necessary 

for home equity lines and loans a number of factors impact the pd specifically the borrower’s current fico score the utilization rate delinquency statistics borrower income current cltv ratio and months on books are all used to assess the borrower’s creditworthiness similarly lgd is also impacted by various factors including the utilization rate the cltv ratio the lien position the housing price index change for the location as measured by the caseshiller index age of the loan and current loan balance 

when we are not in a first lien position we use delinquency information on the first lien exposures obtained from thirdparty credit information providers in the credit assessment for all first liens whether owned by a third party or by us an additional assessment is performed on a quarterly basis in this assessment the most recent three months’ performance of the senior liens is reviewed for delinquency 90 days or more past due modification foreclosure andor bankruptcy statuses if any derogatory status is present the junior lien will be placed on nonaccrual status regardless of its delinquency status on our books this subsequent change to nonaccrual status will alter the treatment in the pd model thus affecting the reserve calculation 

in addition the first lien exposure is combined with the second lien exposure to generate a cltv the cltv is a more accurate reflection of the leverage of the borrower against the property value as compared to the ltv from just the junior liens the cltv is used for modeling both the junior lien pd and lgd this also impacts the alll rates for the junior lien helocs 

the above measures are all used to assess the pd and lgd for heloc borrowers for whom we originated the loans there is also a portfolio of home equity products that were originated and serviced by others however we currently service some of the loans in this portfolio the sbo portfolio is modeled as a separate class and the reserves for this class are generated by using the delinquency roll rate models as described below 

for retail tdrs that are not collateraldependent allowances are developed using the present value of expected future cash flows compared to the recorded investment in the loans expected redefault factors are considered in this analysis retail tdrs that are deemed collateraldependent are written down to the fair market value of the collateral less costs to sell the fair value of collateral is periodically monitored subsequent to the modification 

changes in the levels of estimated losses can significantly affect management’s determination of an appropriate alll for retail loans losses are affected by such factors as loss severity collateral values economic conditions and other factors a one basis point and five basis point increase in the estimated loss rate for retail loans at december 31 2017  would have increased the alll by 6 million and 29 million respectively the alll for our commercial banking segment is sensitive to assigned credit risk ratings and inherent loss rates if 10 and 20 of the december 31 2017  year end loan balances including unfunded commitments within each risk rating category of our commercial banking segment had experienced downgrades of two risk categories the alll would have increased by 60 million and 111 million respectively 

commercial loans and leases are charged off to the alll when there is little prospect of collecting either principal or interest chargeoffs of commercial loans and leases usually involve receipt of borrowerspecific adverse information for commercial collateraldependent loans an appraisal or other valuation is used to quantify a shortfall between the fair value of the collateral less costs to sell and the recorded investment in the commercial loan retail loan chargeoffs are generally based on established delinquency thresholds rather than borrowerspecific adverse information when a loan is collateraldependent any shortfalls between the fair value of the collateral less costs to sell and the recorded investment is promptly charged off placing any loan or lease on nonaccrual status does not by itself require a partial or total chargeoff however any identified losses are charged off at that time 

as of december 31 2017 we enhanced the method for assessing various qualitative risks factors and events that may not be measured in the modeled results the new methodology includes a statistical analysis of prior chargeoff rates on a historical basis combined with a qualitative assessment based on quantitative measures affecting the determination of incurred losses in the loan and lease portfolio and provides better alignment of the qualitative alll to the commercial and retail loan portfolios the impact of the change is an increase of approximately 50 million to the commercial alll with a corresponding decrease to the retail alll there was not a significant impact on the total qualitative alll as of december 31 2017 there were no other material changes in assumptions or

fair value 

we measure fair value using the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date fair value is based upon quoted market prices in an active market where available if quoted prices are not available observable marketbased inputs or independently sourced parameters are used to develop fair value whenever possible such inputs may include prices of similar assets or liabilities yield curves interest rates prepayment speeds and foreign exchange rates 

we classify our assets and liabilities that are carried at fair value in accordance with the threelevel valuation hierarchy 

 classification in the hierarchy is based upon the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement of the asset or liability for instruments classified in level 1 and 2 where inputs are primarily based upon observable market data there is less judgment applied in arriving at the fair value for instruments classified in level 3 management judgment is more significant due to the lack of observable market data 

significant assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis include our mortgagebacked securities available for sale these instruments are priced using an external pricing service and are classified as level 2 within the fair value hierarchy the service’s pricing models use predominantly observable valuation inputs to measure the fair value of these securities under both the market and income approaches the pricing service utilizes a matrix pricing methodology to price our us agency passthrough securities which involves making adjustments to tobeannounced security prices based on a matrix of various mortgagebacked securities characteristics such as weightedaverage maturities indices and other poollevel information other agency and nonagency mortgagebacked securities are priced using a discounted cash flow methodology this methodology includes estimating the cash flows expected to be received for each security using projected prepayment speeds and default rates based on historical statistics of the underlying collateral and current market conventions these estimated cash flows are then discounted using marketbased discount rates that incorporate characteristics such as average life volatility ratings performance of the underlying collateral and prevailing market conditions 

we review and update the fair value hierarchy classifications on a quarterly basis changes from one quarter to the next related to the observability of inputs in fair value measurements may result in a reclassification between the fair value hierarchy levels and are recognized based on yearend balances we also verify the accuracy of the pricing provided by our primary external pricing service on a quarterly basis this process involves using a secondary external vendor to provide valuations for our securities portfolio for comparison purposes any securities with discrepancies beyond a certain threshold are researched and if necessary valued by an independent outside broker 

fair value is also used on a nonrecurring basis to evaluate certain assets for impairment or for disclosure purposes examples of nonrecurring uses of fair value include mortgage servicing rights accounted for by the amortization method loan impairments for certain loans and goodwill 

the fair value of assets under operating leases is determined using collateral specific pricing digests external appraisals broker opinions recent sales data from industry equipment dealers and the discounted cash flows derived from the underlying lease agreement as market data for similar assets and lease agreements is available and used in the valuation these assets are classified as level 2

income taxes 

accrued income taxes are reported as a component of either other assets or other liabilities as appropriate in the consolidated balance sheets deferred income tax assets and liabilities represent our estimate of the amount of future income taxes to be paid or that effectively have been prepaid and the net balance is reported as an asset or liability in the consolidated balance sheets we determine the realization of the deferred tax asset based upon an evaluation of the four possible sources of taxable income i the future reversals of taxable temporary differences ii future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards iii taxable income in prior carryback years if carryback is permitted under the tax law and iv tax planning strategies in projecting future taxable income we utilize forecasted pretax earnings adjust for the estimated book tax differences and incorporate assumptions including the amount of income allocable to taxing jurisdictions these assumptions require significant judgment and are consistent with the plans and estimates that we use to manage the underlying businesses the realization of the deferred tax assets could be reduced in the future if these estimates are significantly different than forecasted 

we are subject to income tax in the us and multiple state and local jurisdictions the tax laws and regulations in each jurisdiction may be interpreted differently in certain situations which could result in a range of outcomes thus we are required to exercise judgment regarding the application of these tax laws and regulations we evaluate and recognize tax liabilities related to any tax uncertainties due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties the ultimate resolution may differ from the current estimate of tax liabilities or refunds 

our estimate of accrued income taxes deferred income taxes and income tax expense can also change in any period as a result of new legislative or judicial guidance impacting tax positions as well as changes in income tax rates

risk governance 

we are committed to maintaining a strong integrated and proactive approach to the management of all risks to which we are exposed in pursuit of our business objectives a key aspect of our board’s responsibility as the main decision making body is setting our risk appetite to ensure that the levels of risk that we are willing to accept in the attainment of our strategic business and financial objectives are clearly understood 

to enable our board to carry out its objectives it has delegated authority for risk management activities as well as governance and oversight of those activities to a number of board and executive management level risk committees the executive risk committee “erc” chaired by the chief risk officer is responsible for oversight of risk across the enterprise and actively considers our inherent material risks analyzes our overall risk profile and seeks confirmation that the risks are being appropriately identified assessed and mitigated reporting to the erc are the following additional committees covering specific areas of risk compliance and operational risk committee model risk committee credit policy committee assetliability committee business initiatives review committee and the ethics oversight committee 

risk framework 

our risk management framework is embedded in our business through a “three lines of defense” model which defines responsibilities and accountabilities for risk management activities 

first line of defense 

the business lines including their associated support functions are the first line of defense and are accountable for identifying assessing managing and controlling the risks associated with the products and services they provide the business lines are responsible for performing regular risk assessments to identify and assess the material risks that arise in their area of responsibility complying with relevant risk policies testing and certifying the adequacy and effectiveness of their operational and financial reporting controls on a regular basis establishing

and documenting operating procedures and establishing and owning a governance structure for identifying and managing risk 

second line of defense 

the second line of defense includes independent monitoring and control functions accountable for developing and ensuring implementation of risk and control frameworks and related policies this centralized risk function is appropriately independent from the business and is accountable for overseeing and challenging our business lines on the effective management of their risks including credit market operational regulatory reputational interest rate liquidity and strategic risks 

third line of defense 

our internal audit function is the third line of defense providing independent assurance with a view of the effectiveness of citizens’ internal controls governance practices and culture so that risk is managed appropriately for the size complexity and risk profile of the organization internal audit has complete and unrestricted access to any and all bank records physical properties and personnel internal audit issues a report following each internal review and provides an audit opinion to citizens’ audit committee on a quarterly basis 

credit quality assurance reports to the chief audit executive and provides the legalentity boards senior management and other stakeholders with independent assurance on the quality of credit portfolios and adherence to agreed credit risk appetite and credit policies and processes in line with its procedures and regulatory expectations the credit quality assurance function undertakes a program of portfolio testing assessing and reporting through four risk pillars of asset quality rating and data integrity risk management and credit risk appetite 

risk appetite 

risk appetite is a strategic business and risk management tool we define our risk appetite as the maximum limit of acceptable risk beyond which we could be unable to achieve our strategic objectives and capital adequacy obligations 

our principal nonmarket risks include credit operational regulatory reputational liquidity and strategic risks we are also subject to certain market risks which include potential losses arising from changes in interest rates foreign exchange rates equity prices commodity prices andor other relevant market rates or prices market risk in our business arises from trading activities that serve customer needs including hedging of interest rates foreign exchange risk and nontrading activities within capital markets we have established enterprisewide policies and methodologies to identify measure monitor and report on market risk we actively manage both trading and nontrading market risks see “—market risk” for further information our risk appetite is reviewed and approved annually by the board risk committee 

credit risk 

overview 

credit risk represents the potential for loss arising from a customer counterparty or issuer failing to perform in accordance with the contractual terms of the obligation while the majority of our credit risk is associated with lending activities we do engage with other financial counterparties for a variety of purposes including investing asset and liability management and trading activities given the financial impact of credit risk on our earnings and balance sheet the assessment approval and management of credit risk represents a major part of our overall riskmanagement responsibility 

objective 

the independent credit risk function is responsible for reviewing and approving credit risk appetite across all lines of business and credit products approving larger and higher risk credit transactions monitoring portfolio performance identifying problem credit exposures and ensuring remedial management

management’s discussion and analysis 

organizational structure 

management and oversight of credit risk is the responsibility of both the business line and the second line of defense the second line of defense the independent credit risk function is led by the chief credit officer who oversees all of our credit risk the chief credit officer reports to the chief risk officer the chief credit officer acting in a manner consistent with board policies has responsibility for among other things the governance process around policies procedures risk acceptance criteria credit risk appetite limits and authority delegation the chief credit officer and team also have responsibility for credit approvals for larger and higher risk transactions and oversight of line of business credit risk activities reporting to the chief credit officer are the heads of the second line of defense credit functions specializing in consumer banking commercial banking citizens restructuring management portfolio and corporate reporting alll analytics current expected credit loss and credit policy and administration each team under these leaders is composed of highly experienced credit professionals 

governance 

the primary mechanisms used to govern our credit risk function are our consumer and commercial credit policies these policies outline the minimum acceptable lending standards that align with our desired risk appetite material changes in our business model and strategies that identify a need to change our risk appetite or highlight a risk not previously contemplated are identified by the individual committees and presented to the credit policy committee executive risk committee and the board risk committee for approval as appropriate 

key management processes 

we employ a comprehensive and integrated risk control program to proactively i identify ii measure iii monitor and iv mitigate existing and emerging credit risks across the credit lifecycle origination account managementportfolio management and loss mitigation and recovery 

consumer 

on the consumer banking side of credit risk our teams use models to evaluate consumer loans across the lifecycle of the loan starting at origination credit scoring models are used to forecast the probability of default of an applicant when approving customers for a new loan or extension of an existing credit line credit scores are used in conjunction with other credit risk variables such as affordability length of term collateral value collateral type and lien subordination 

to ensure proper oversight of the underwriting teams lending authority is granted by the second line of defense credit risk function to each underwriter the amount of delegated authority depends on the experience of the individual we periodically evaluate the performance of each underwriter and annually reauthorize their delegated authority only senior members of the second line of defense credit risk team are authorized to approve significant exceptions to credit policies it is not uncommon to make exceptions to established policies when compensating factors are present there are exception limits which when reached trigger a comprehensive analysis 

once an account is established credit scores and collateral values are refreshed at regular intervals to allow for proactive identification of increasing or decreasing levels of credit risk our approach to managing credit risk is highly analytical and where appropriate is automated to ensure consistency and efficiency 

commercial 

on the commercial banking side of credit risk the structure is broken into ci loans and leases and cre within ci loans and leases there are separate verticals established for certain specialty products eg assetbased lending leasing franchise finance health care and technology midcorporate a “specialty vertical” is a standalone team of industry or product specialists substantially all activity that falls under the ambit of the defined industry or product is managed through a specialty vertical when one exists cre also operates as a specialty vertical 

commercial credit risk management begins with defined credit products and policies 

commercial transactions are subject to individual analysis and approval at origination and with few exceptions are subject to a formal annual review requirement the underwriting process includes the establishment and approval of credit grades that confirm the pd and lgd all material transactions then require the approval of both a business line approver and an independent credit approver with the requisite level of delegated authority the approval level of a particular credit facility is determined by the size of the credit relationship as well as the pd the checks and balances in the credit process and the independence of the credit approver function are designed to appropriately assess and sanction the level of credit risk being accepted facilitate the early recognition of credit

management’s discussion and analysis 

problems when they occur and to provide for effective problem asset management and resolution all authority to grant credit is delegated through the independent credit risk function and is closely monitored and regularly updated 

the primary factors considered in commercial credit approvals are the financial strength of the borrower assessment of the borrower’s management capabilities cash flows from operations industry sector trends type and sufficiency of collateral type of exposure transaction structure and the general economic outlook while these are the primary factors considered there are a number of other factors that may be considered in the decision process in addition to the credit analysis conducted during the approval process at origination and annual review our credit quality assurance group performs testing to provide an independent review and assessment of the quality of the portfolio and new originations this group conducts portfolio reviews on a riskbased cycle to evaluate individual loans and validate risk ratings as well as test the consistency of the credit processes and the effectiveness of credit risk management 

the maximum level of credit exposure to individual credit borrowers is limited by policy guidelines based on the perceived risk of each borrower or related group of borrowers concentration risk is managed through limits on industry asset class and loan quality factors we focus predominantly on extending credit to commercial customers with existing or expandable relationships within our primary markets for this purpose defined as our 11 state footprint plus contiguous states although we do engage in lending opportunities outside our primary markets if we believe that the associated risks are acceptable and aligned with strategic initiatives 

substantially all loans categorized as classified are managed by a specialized group of credit professionals 

market risk 

market risk refers to potential losses arising from changes in interest rates foreign exchange rates equity prices commodity prices andor other relevant market rates or prices modest market risk arises from trading activities that serve customer needs including hedging of interest rate and foreign exchange risk as described below more material market risk arises from our nontrading banking activities such as loan origination and depositgathering we have established enterprisewide policies and methodologies to identify measure monitor and report market risk we actively manage both trading and nontrading market risks 

nontrading risk 

we are exposed to market risk as a result of nontrading banking activities this market risk is substantially composed of interest rate risk as we have no direct currency or commodity risk and de minimis equity risk we also have market risk related to capital markets loan originations as well as the valuation of our mortgage servicing rights 

interest rate risk 

interest rate risk emerges from the balance sheet after the aggregation of our assets liabilities and equity we refer to this nontrading risk embedded in the balance sheet as “structural interest rate risk” or “interest rate risk in the banking book” 

a major source of structural interest rate risk is a difference in the repricing of assets on the one hand and liabilities and equity on the other first there are differences in the timing and drivers of rate changes reflecting the maturity andor repricing of assets and liabilities for example the rate earned on a commercial loan may reprice monthly with changes in libor while the rate paid on a debt or certificates of deposit may be fixed for a longer period there are differences in the drivers of rate changes as well loans may be tied to a specific index rate such as libor or prime while deposits may be only loosely correlated with libor and depend on competitive demand due to these basis differences net interest income is sensitive to changes in spreads between certain indices or repricing rates 

another important source of structural interest rate risk relates to the potential exercise of explicit or embedded options for example most consumer loans can be prepaid without penalty and most consumer deposits can be withdrawn without penalty the exercise of such options by customers can exacerbate the timing differences discussed above 

a primary source of our structural interest rate risk relates to faster repricing of floating rate loans relative to the retail deposit funding this source of asset sensitivity is now fairly evenly split between the short and long ends of the yield curve for the past eight years with the federal funds rate near zero this risk had been asymmetrical with significantly more upside benefit than potential exposure as interest rates have begun to rise the risk position has become more symmetrical as rates can decline further before becoming floored at zero 

citizens financial group inc 

management’s discussion and analysis 

the secondary source of our interest rate risk is driven by longer term rates comprising the rollover or reinvestment risk on fixed rate loans as well as the prepayment risk on mortgage related loans and securities funded by nonrate sensitive deposits and equity 

the primary goal of interest rate risk management is to control exposure to interest rate risk within policy limits approved by the board these limits and guidelines reflect our tolerance for interest rate risk over both shortterm and longterm horizons to ensure that exposure to interest rate risk is managed within this risk appetite we must both measure the exposure and as necessary hedge it the treasury asset and liability management team is responsible for measuring monitoring and reporting on the structural interest rate risk position these exposures are reported on a monthly basis to the asset and liability committee “alco” and at board meetings 

we measure structural interest rate risk through a variety of metrics intended to quantify both shortterm and longterm exposures the primary method that we use to quantify interest rate risk is simulation analysis in which we model net interest income from assets liabilities and hedge derivative positions under various interest rate scenarios over a threeyear horizon exposure to interest rate risk is reflected in the variation of forecasted net interest income across scenarios 

key assumptions in this simulation analysis relate to the behavior of interest rates and spreads the changes in product balances and the behavior of loan and deposit clients in different rate environments the most material of these behavioral assumptions relate to the repricing characteristics and balance fluctuations of deposits with indeterminate ie noncontractual maturities as well as the pace of mortgage prepayments assessments are periodically made by running sensitivity analysis of the impact of key assumptions the results of these analyses are reported to alco 

as the future path of interest rates cannot be known in advance we use simulation analysis to project net interest income under various interest rate scenarios including a “most likely” implied forward scenario as well as a variety of deliberately extreme and perhaps unlikely scenarios these scenarios may assume gradual ramping of the overall level of interest rates immediate shocks to the level of rates and various yield curve twists in which movements in short or longterm rates predominate generally projected net interest income in any interest rate scenario is compared to net interest income in a base case where market forward rates are realized 

the table below reports net interest income exposures against a variety of interest rate scenarios our policies involve measuring exposures as a percentage change in net interest income over the next year due to either instantaneous or gradual parallel changes in rates relative to the market implied forward yield curve with rates rising from historically low levels due to federal open market committee rate increases in december 2016 march 2017 june 2017 and december 2017 exposure to falling rates has increased while rates have begun to rise off of the very low levels an instantaneous decline of 20 is still not possible as the following table illustrates our balance sheet is assetsensitive net interest income would benefit from an increase in interest rates exposure to a decline in interest rates is within limit while an instantaneous and severe shift in interest rates was used in this analysis we believe that any actual shift in interest rates would likely be more gradual and would therefore have a more modest impact as demonstrated in the following table 

the table below presents the sensitivity of net interest income to various parallel yield curve shifts from the market implied forward yield curve 



asset sensitivity against a 200 basis point gradual increase in rates was 51  at december 31 2017  a decline from 59  at december 31 2016  the core asset sensitivity is the result of a faster repricing of the loan book relative 

citizens financial group inc 

management’s discussion and analysis 

to the deposit and equity funding as the fed has slowly begun to normalize rates given improved economic growth and data this upward trend in rates has benefited our net interest income and net interest margin as a result of the asset sensitivity the risk position can be affected by changes in interest rates which impact the repricing sensitivity or beta of the deposit base as well as the cash flows on prepayable assets the risk position is managed within our risk limits through occasional adjustments to securities investments interest rate swaps and mix of funding 

we use a valuation measure of exposure to structural interest rate risk economic value of equity “eve” as a supplement to net interest income simulations eve complements net interest income simulation analysis as it estimates risk exposure over a longterm horizon eve measures the extent to which the economic value of assets liabilities and offbalance sheet instruments may change in response to fluctuation in interest rates this analysis is highly dependent upon assumptions applied to assets and liabilities with noncontractual maturities the change in value is expressed as a percentage of regulatory capital 

capital markets 

a key component of our capital markets activities is the underwriting and distribution of corporate credit facilities to partially finance mergers and acquisitions transactions for our clients we have a rigorous risk management process around these activities including a limit structure capping our underwriting risk our potential loss and sub limits for specific asset classes further the ability to approve underwriting exposure is delegated only to senior level individuals in the credit risk management and capital markets organizations with each transaction adjudicated in a formal committee meeting 

mortgage servicing rights 

we have market risk associated with the value of the mortgage servicing right assets which are impacted by the level of interest rates as of december 31 2017  and 2016  our mortgage servicing rights had a book value of 198 million  and 162 million  respectively and were carried at the lower of cost or fair value as of december 31 2017  and 2016  the fair value of the mortgage servicing rights was 218 million  and 182 million  respectively which exceeded the carrying value at those dates depending on the interest rate environment hedges may be used to stabilize the market value of the mortgage servicing right asset 

trading risk 

we are exposed to market risk primarily through client facilitation activities including derivatives and foreign exchange products as well as underwriting and market making activities exposure is created as a result of changes in interest rates and related basis spreads and volatility foreign exchange rates and credit spreads on a select range of interest rates foreign exchange and secondary loan instruments these trading activities are conducted through our two banking subsidiaries cbna and cbpa 

client facilitation activities consist primarily of interest rate derivatives and foreign exchange contracts where we enter into offsetting trades with a separate counterparty or exchange to manage our market risk exposure in addition to the aforementioned activities we operate a secondary loan trading desk with the objective to meet secondary liquidity needs of our issuing clients’ transactions and investor clients we do not engage in any trading activities with the intent to benefit from short term price differences 

we record interest rate derivatives and foreign exchange contracts as derivative assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets trading assets and liabilities are carried at fair value with income earned related to these activities included in net interest income changes in fair value of trading assets and liabilities are reflected in other income a component of noninterest income on the consolidated statements of operations 

market risk governance   

the market risk limit setting process is established in line with the formal enterprise risk appetite process and policy this appetite reflects the strategic and enterprise level articulation of opportunities for creating franchise value set to the boundaries of how much market risk to take dealing authorities represent the key control tool in the management of market risk that allows the cascading of the risk appetite throughout the enterprise a dealing authority sets the operational scope and tolerances within which a business andor trading desk is permitted to operate and this is reviewed at least annually dealing authorities are structured to accommodate the client facing trades and hedges needed to manage the risk profile primary responsibility for keeping within established tolerances resides with the business key risk indicators including var open foreign currency positions and single name risk are monitored on a daily basis and reported against tolerances consistent with our risk appetite and business strategy to relevant business line management and risk counterparts

market risk measurement 

we use var as a statistical measure for estimating potential exposure of our traded market risk in normal market conditions our var framework for risk management and regulatory reporting is the same risk management var is based on a one day holding period to a 99 confidence level whereas regulatory var is based on a ten day holding period to the same confidence level additional to var nonstatistical measurements for measuring risk are employed such as sensitivity analysis market value and stress testing 

our market risk platform and associated market risk and valuation models for our foreign exchange interest rate products and traded loans capture correlation effects and allow for aggregation of market risk across risk types business lines and legal entities we measure monitor and report market risk for both management and regulatory capital purposes 

var overview 

  the market risk measurement model is based on historical simulation the var measure estimates the extent of any fair value losses on trading positions that may occur due to broad market movements general var such as changes in the level of interest rates foreign exchange rates equity prices and commodity prices it is calculated on the basis that current positions remain broadly unaltered over the course of a given holding period it is assumed that markets are sufficiently liquid to allow the business to close its positions if required within this holding period var’s benefit is that it captures the historic correlations of a portfolio based on the composition of our “covered positions” we also use a standardized addon approach for the loan trading desk’s specific risk capital which estimates the extent of any losses that may occur from factors other than broad market movements during the quarter ending march 31 2017 we integrated our secondary traded loans into our enterprise wide market risk platform for the calculation of var on the general interest rate risk embedded within the traded loans and thus retired the associated standalone model that replicated the general var methodology on the traded loans the related capital was historically reflected on the “de minimis” line in the following section in prior quarters the measured var on the trading portfolio is now comprised of three covered position subportfolios interest rate derivatives foreign exchange and traded loans the general var approach is expressed in terms of a confidence level over the past 500 trading days the internal var measure used as the basis of the main var trading limits is a 99 confidence level with a one day holding period meaning that a loss greater than the var is expected to occur on average on only one day in 100 trading days ie 1 of the time theoretically there should be a loss event greater than var two to three times per year the regulatory measure of var is done at a 99 confidence level with a tenday holding period the historical market data applied to calculate the var is updated on a two business day lag refer to “market risk regulatory capital” below for details of our tenday var metrics for the quarters ended december 31 2017  and 2016  including high low average and period end var for interest rate and foreign exchange rate risks as well as total var

market risk regulatory capital 

the us banking regulators’ “market risk rule” covers the calculation of market risk capital the market risk rule commonly known as basel 25 substantially modified the determination of market riskweighted assets and implemented a more risk sensitive methodology for the risk inherent in certain trading positions categorized as “covered positions” for the purposes of the market risk rule all of our client facing trades and associated hedges need to maintain a low risk profile to qualify and do qualify as “covered positions” for the three months ended december 31 2017  we were not subject to the reporting threshold under the market risk rule as we did not meet the applicability threshold and as such our covered trading activities were riskweighted under us basel iii standardized credit risk rules while not subject to the determination requirements of market riskweighted assets we nevertheless comply with the market risk rule’s other requirements the internal management var measure is calculated based on the same population of trades that is utilized for regulatory var the following table presents for information and comparison purposes the results of our modeled and nonmodeled measures for regulatory capital calculations as if we had met the threshold under the market risk rule for both periods presented 



 1  for the three months ended december 31 2017  we did not meet the reporting threshold prescribed by market risk capital guidelines 

stressed var 

svar is an extension of var but uses a longer historical lookback horizon that is fixed from january 3 2005 this is done not only to identify headline risks from more volatile periods but also to provide a counterbalance to var which may be low during periods of low volatility the holding period for profit and loss determination is ten days in addition to risk management purposes svar is also a component of market risk regulatory capital we calculate svar daily under its own dynamic window regime in a dynamic window regime values of the tenday 99 var are calculated over all possible 260day periods that can be obtained from the complete historical data set refer to “market risk regulatory capital” above for details of svar metrics including high low average and period end svar for the combined portfolio 

sensitivity analysis 

sensitivity analysis is the measure of exposure to a single risk factor such as a one basis point change in rates or credit spread we conduct and monitor sensitivity on interest rates basis spreads foreign exchange exposures option prices and credit spreads whereas var is based on previous moves in market risk factors over recent periods it may not be an accurate predictor of future market moves sensitivity analysis complements var as it provides an indication of risk relative to each factor irrespective of historical market moves and is an effective tool in evaluating the appropriateness of hedging strategies and concentrations

management’s discussion and analysis 

stress testing 

conducting a stress test of a portfolio consists of running risk models with the inclusion of key variables that simulate various historical or hypothetical scenarios for historical stress tests profit and loss results are simulated for selected time periods corresponding to the most volatile underlying returns while hypothetical stress tests aim to consider concentration risk illiquidity under stressed market conditions and risk arising from our trading activities that may not be fully captured by our other models hypothetical scenarios also assume that market moves happen simultaneously and no repositioning or hedging activity takes place to mitigate losses as events unfold we generate stress tests of our trading positions on a daily basis for example we currently include a stress test that simulates a “lehmantype” crisis scenario by taking the worst 20trading day peak to trough moves for the various risk factors that go into var from that period and assumes they occurred simultaneously 

var model review and validation 

market risk measurement models used are independently reviewed and subject to ongoing performance analysis by the model owner the independent review and validation focuses on the model methodology market data and performance independent review of market risk measurement models is the responsibility of citizens’ model risk management and validation team aspects covered include challenging the assumptions used the quantitative techniques employed and the theoretical justification underpinning them and an assessment of the soundness of the required data over time where possible the quantitative impact of the major underlying modeling assumptions will be estimated eg through developing alternative models results of such reviews are shared with the us banking regulators the market risk models may be periodically enhanced due to changes in market price levels and price action regime behavior the market risk management and validation team will conduct internal validation before a new or changed model element is implemented and before a change is made to a market data mapping

var backtesting   

backtesting is one form of validation of the var model and is run daily the market risk rule requires a comparison of our internal var measure to the actual net trading revenue excluding fees commissions reserves intraday trading and net interest income for each day over the preceding year the most recent 250 business days any observed loss in excess of the var number is taken as an exception the level of exceptions determines the multiplication factor used to derive the var and svarbased capital requirement for regulatory reporting purposes when applicable we perform subportfolio backtesting as required under the market risk rule and as approved by our banking regulators for interest rate credit spread and foreign exchange positions the following graph shows our daily net trading revenue and total internal modeled var for the quarters ended december 31 2017 september 30 2017 june 30 2017 and march 31 2017

business strategy 

our objective is to be a topperforming bank that delivers value for each of our stakeholders by offering the best possible banking experience for customers we plan to achieve this by leveraging our strong customer relationships leading market share rankings in attractive markets customercentric colleagues and our highquality balance sheet 

our strategy is designed to maximize the full potential of our business and drive sustainable growth and enhanced profitability as a core measure of success our mediumterm financial targets include a rotce ratio of greater than 10 and an efficiency ratio in the 60 range our financial targets are based on numerous assumptions including the yield curve evolving consistent with marketimplied forward rates and macroeconomic and competitive conditions that are consistent with those used in our planning assumptions 

while our strategic plan and our rotce target and its components are presented with numerical specificity and we believe such targets to be reasonable given the uncertainties surrounding our assumptions there are significant risks that these assumptions may not be realized and thus our goals may not be achieved accordingly our actual results may differ from these targets and the differences may be material and adverse particularly if actual events adversely differ from one or more of our key assumptions we caution investors not to place undue reliance on any of these assumptions or targets 

we intend to deliver on our strategy by adhering to the following strategic principles 

 in order to execute on these principles successfully we have developed the following strategic priorities each of which are underpinned by a series of initiatives as summarized below we continue to make solid progress on our strategic priorities from our initial public offering but continually reevaluate them to ensure we maintain a strong value proposition consistent with changing customer preferences and market trends 

position consumer banking to deliver improved capabilities and profitability consumer banking focus is on building strong customer relationships along with a robust product portfolio that is designed to be simple and easy to understand while creating a fair value exchange for our customers and offers a “simple clear personal” value proposition to our customers while we continue to offer a broad range of banking services for our mass consumer customer base we have tightened our focus on the mass affluent and affluent customer segments by offering tailored products services and advice with fewer fees and better rates this strategy will help us attract retain and deepen these customer relationships the following initiatives are being implemented to execute against our strategy

grow the balance sheet to build scale and better leverage our cost base and infrastructure we have a scalable operating platform that has the capacity to accommodate a significantly larger balance sheet than our current size prior to the global financial crisis we had expanded to nearly 170 billion in assets which was then intentionally contracted in order to reposition the bank and strengthen our business profile through the run off of noncore assets and reduced dependency on wholesale funding we continue to prudently grow the balance sheet primarily through organic loan growth and selective portfolio purchases

competition 

the financial services industry is highly competitive our branch footprint is in the new england midatlantic and midwest regions though certain lines of business serve broader national markets within those markets we face competition from community banks superregional and national financial institutions credit unions savings and loan associations mortgage banking firms consumer finance companies securities brokerage firms insurance companies and money market funds some of our larger competitors may make available to their customers a broader array of product pricing and structure alternatives while some smaller competitors may have more liberal lending policies and processes competition among providers of financial products and services continues to increase with consumers having the opportunity to select from a growing variety of traditional and nontraditional alternatives the ability of nonbanking financial institutions to provide services previously limited to commercial banks has also intensified competition 

in consumer banking the industry has become increasingly dependent on and oriented toward technologydriven delivery systems permitting transactions to be conducted through telephone online and mobile channels in addition technology has lowered barriers to entry and made it possible for nonbank institutions to attract funds and provide lending and other financial services in our footprint despite not having a physical presence within our footprint given their lower cost structure these institutions are often able to offer higher rates on deposit products than what may be average for the market for retail banking institutions with a traditional branch footprint such as us the primary factors driving competition for loans and deposits are interest rates fees charged customer service levels convenience including branch location and hours of operation and the range of products and services offered in particular competition for home equity lines and auto loans has intensified resulting in pressure on pricing 

in commercial banking there is intense competition for quality loan originations from traditional banking institutions particularly large regional banks as well as commercial finance companies leasing companies and other nonbank lenders and institutional investors including clo managers hedge funds and private equity firms some larger competitors including certain national banks that have a significant presence in our market area may offer a broader array of products and due to their asset size may sometimes be in a position to hold more exposure on their own balance sheet we compete on a number of factors including among others customer service quality of execution range of products offered price and reputation 

intellectual property 

in the highly competitive banking industry in which we operate trademarks service marks trade names and logos are important to the success of our business we own and license a variety of trademarks service marks trade names logos and pending registrations and are spending significant resources to develop our standalone brands in connection with our initial public offering we entered into a trademark license agreement pursuant to which we were granted a limited license to use the rbs daisywheel trademark for an initial term of five years and at our option up to ten years 

information technology systems 

we continue to make significant investments in our information technology systems for our banking lending and cash management activities investment is necessary to offer new products and improve our overall customer experience as well as to provide scale for future growth and acquisitions the technology investments include replacing systems that support our branch tellers commercial loans automobile loans and treasury solutions additional investments that are in process include creating an enterprise data warehouse to capture and manage data to better understand our customers identify our capital requirements and support regulatory reporting and a new mortgage system for our home lending solutions business 

regulation and supervision 

our operations are subject to extensive regulation supervision and examination under federal and state laws these laws and regulations cover all aspects of our business including lending practices safeguarding deposits customer privacy and information security capital structure transactions with affiliates and conduct and qualifications of personnel these laws and regulations are intended primarily for the protection of depositors the deposit insurance fund and the banking system as a whole and not for the protection of shareholders or other investors the discussion below outlines the material elements of selected laws and regulations applicable to us and our subsidiaries changes in applicable law or regulation and in their interpretation and

application by regulatory agencies and other governmental authorities cannot be predicted but may have a material effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

as described in more detail below the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act of 2010 the “doddfrank act” and its implementing regulations significantly restructured the financial regulatory regime in the united states and enhanced supervision and prudential standards for large bank holding companies the implications of the doddfrank act for our businesses depend to a large extent on the manner in which its implementing regulations continue to be established and interpreted by the primary us financial regulatory agencies  the frb the fdic the occ the sec and the commodity futures trading commission “cftc” certain aspects of the doddfrank act remain subject to further rulemaking take effect over various transition periods or contain other elements that make it difficult to precisely anticipate their full impact recent political developments including the change in administration in the us have added additional uncertainty to the implementation scope and timing of regulatory reforms 

overview 

we are a bank holding company under the bank holding company act of 1956 “bank holding company act” we have elected to be treated as a financial holding company under amendments to the bank holding company act as effected by glba as such we are subject to the supervision examination and reporting requirements of the bank holding company act and the regulations of the frb including through the federal reserve bank of boston under the system of “functional regulation” established under the bank holding company act the frb serves as the primary regulator of our consolidated organization and the primary regulator of our brokerdealer subsidiary the sec directly regulates the activities of that subsidiary with the frb exercising a supervisory role the doddfrank act amendments to the bank holding company act require the frb to examine the activities of nondepository institution subsidiaries of bank holding companies that are not functionally regulated that are engaged in depository institutionpermissible activities and provides the frb with backup examination and enforcement authority for such activities the frb also has the authority to require reports of and examine any holding company subsidiary 

our principal bank subsidiary cbna is a national banking association as such it is subject to regulation examination and supervision by the occ as its primary federal regulator and by the fdic as the insurer of its deposits 

cbpa is a pennsylvaniachartered savings bank accordingly it is subject to supervision by the department of banking of the commonwealth of pennsylvania the “pa banking department” as its chartering agency and regulation supervision and examination by the fdic as the primary federal regulator of statechartered savings banks and as the insurer of its deposits 

 the federal and state banking regulators are given authority to approve or disapprove mergers acquisitions consolidations the establishment of branches and similar corporate actions these banking regulators also have the power to prevent the continuance or development of unsafe or unsound banking practices or other violations of law state and federal law govern the activities in which cbna and cbpa engage including the investments each makes and the aggregate amount of loans that may be granted to one borrower various consumer and compliance laws and regulations also affect their operations cbna and cbpa also are affected by the actions of the frb as it implements monetary policy 

in addition cbna and cbpa are subject to regulation supervision and examination by the cfpb with respect to consumer protection laws and regulations the cfpb has broad authority to among other things regulate the offering and provision of consumer financial products by depository institutions with more than 10 billion in total assets the cfpb may promulgate rules under a variety of consumer financial protection statutes including the truth in lending act the electronic funds transfer act and the real estate settlement procedures act 

financial regulatory reform 

the doddfrank act represents a significant overhaul of many aspects of the regulation of the financial services industry addressing among other things systemic risk capital adequacy deposit insurance assessments consumer financial protection regulation of derivatives and securities markets restrictions on an insured bank’s transactions with its affiliates lending limits and mortgagelending practices moreover as a general matter the federal banking regulators the frb the occ and the fdic as well as the cfpb have taken a more stringent approach to supervising and regulating financial institutions and financial products and services over which they exercise their respective supervisory authorities including with respect to enforcement matters our two banking subsidiaries and our products and services have been subject to greater supervisory scrutiny and enhanced supervisory requirements and expectations in recent years 

sections 165 and 166 of the doddfrank act direct the frb to establish enhanced prudential standards and early remediation requirements applicable to large financial institutions with total consolidated assets of 50 billion or more the frb has adopted final rules implementing three aspects of sections 165 and 166  liquidity requirements stress testing of capital and overall risk management requirements the final rules’ liquidity requirements are described below under “—liquidity standards” and their stress testing requirements are described below under “—capital planning and stress testing requirements” 

citizens financial group inc 

business 

section 165 of the doddfrank act also requires bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of 50 billion or more to submit resolution plans to the frb and fdic providing for the company’s strategy for rapid and orderly resolution in the event of its material financial distress or failure in september 2011 these agencies issued a joint final resolution plan rule implementing this requirement the fdic issued a separate such rule applicable to insured depository institutions of 50 billion or more in total assets such as cbna we submitted our most recent resolution plan to the frb and fdic in december 2016 cbna submitted its most recent resolution plan to the fdic in december 2015 if the frb and the fdic determine that these plans are not credible and we do not cure the deficiencies the frb and the fdic may impose more stringent capital leverage or liquidity requirements or restrictions on our growth activities or operations 

the frb has not yet adopted final rules implementing two key requirements of section 165 and 166  single counterparty credit limits “sccl” and early remediation requirements in march 2016 the frb issued a reproposal of its sccl rules initially published for comment in 2014 as reproposed we and our controlled entities would be prohibited from having an aggregate net credit exposure to any counterparty as broadly defined in the proposed rule to include certain related entities to the entity that is the direct obligor exceeding 25 of our tier 1 capital the sccl rules when finalized may affect our ability to enter into transactions including as hedges for other exposures with other financial institutions 

the basel iii rules summarized briefly below have impacted our level of capital and may influence the types of business we may pursue and how we pursue business opportunities among other things the basel iii rules raised the required minimums for certain capital ratios added a common equity ratio included capital buffers and restricted what constitutes capital the capital and risk weighting requirements became effective for us on january 1 2015 

many of the provisions of the doddfrank act and other laws are subject to further rulemaking guidance and interpretation by the applicable federal regulators we will continue to evaluate the impact of any changes in law and any new regulations promulgated including changes in regulatory costs and fees modifications to consumer products or disclosures required by the cfpb and the requirements of the enhanced supervision provisions among others 

financial holding company regulation 

the bank holding company act generally restricts bank holding companies from engaging in business activities other than i banking managing or controlling banks ii furnishing services to or performing services for subsidiaries and iii activities that the frb has determined to be so closely related to banking as to be a proper incident thereto for so long as they continue to meet the eligibility requirements for financial holding company status financial holding companies may engage in a broader range of activities including among other things securities underwriting and dealing insurance underwriting and brokerage merchant banking and other activities that are determined by the frb in cooperation with the treasury department to be “financial in nature or incidental thereto” or that the frb determines unilaterally to be “complementary” to financial activities in addition a financial holding company may conduct permissible new financial activities or acquire permissible nonbank financial companies with afterthefact notice to the frb 

as noted above we have elected to be treated as a financial holding company under amendments to the bank holding company act as effected by glba to maintain financial holding company status a financial holding company and all of its insured depository institution subsidiaries must remain well capitalized and well managed as described below under “federal deposit insurance act” and maintain a cra rating of at least “satisfactory” if a financial holding company ceases to meet these requirements the frb’s regulations provide that the financial holding company must enter into an agreement with the frb to comply with all applicable capital and management requirements until the financial holding company returns to compliance the frb may impose limitations or conditions on the conduct of its activities and the company may not commence any of the broader financial activities permissible for financial holding companies or acquire a company engaged in such financial activities without prior approval of the frb in addition the failure to meet such requirements could result in other material restrictions on the activities of the financial holding company may also adversely affect the financial holding company’s ability to enter into certain transactions including acquisition transactions or obtain necessary approvals in connection therewith and may result in the bank holding company losing financial holding company status any restrictions imposed on our activities by the frb may not necessarily be made known to the public if the company does not return to compliance within 180 days the frb may require the financial holding company to divest its subsidiary depository institutions or to discontinue or divest investments in companies engaged in activities permissible only for a bank holding company electing to be treated as a financial holding company bank holding companies and banks must also be both well capitalized and well managed in order to acquire banks located outside their home state 

currently under the bank holding company act we may not be able to engage in certain categories of new activities or acquire shares or control of other companies other than in connection with internal reorganizations

financial subsidiary compliance requirements 

a financial subsidiary of a national bank is permitted to engage in a broader range of activities similar to those of a financial holding company than those permissible for a national bank itself cbna has two financial subsidiaries citizens securities inc a registered brokerdealer and rbs citizens insurance agency inc a dormant entity on march 13 2014 the occ determined that cbna no longer met the conditions to own a financial subsidiary  namely that cbna must be both well capitalized and well managed cbna entered into an agreement with the occ pursuant to which it developed and submitted to the occ a remediation plan setting forth the specific actions it will take to bring itself back into compliance with the conditions to own a financial subsidiary cbna has completed its undertakings under the plan which have been validated by our internal audit team and submitted to the occ for review and approval however until the plan has been approved by the occ cbna will be subject to restrictions on its ability to acquire control or hold an interest in any new financial subsidiary and to commence new activities in any existing financial subsidiary without the prior consent of the occ 

our bank subsidiaries are also making improvements to their compliance management systems fair lending compliance risk management identity theft and debt cancellation addon product practices overdraft fees and deposit reconciliation practices mortgage servicing thirdparty payment processor activities oversight of thirdparty providers consumer compliance program policies procedures and training information security and consumer complaints process in order to address deficiencies in those areas these efforts require us to make investments in additional resources and systems and also require a significant commitment of managerial time and attention 

we are also required to make improvements to our overall compliance and operational risk management programs and practices to comply with enhanced supervisory requirements and expectations and to address weaknesses in retail credit risk management liquidity risk management model risk management outsourcing and vendor risk management and related oversight and monitoring practices and tools 

capital 

we must comply with the frb’s capital adequacy rules cbna and cbpa must comply with similar capital adequacy rules of the occ and fdic respectively the capital adequacy rules of all three agencies are based on the basel iii framework for more detail on our regulatory capital see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — capital” in part ii item 7 included in this report 

prior to january 1 2015 the riskbased capital standards applicable to us and our bank subsidiaries the “general riskbased capital rules” were based on the 1988 capital accord known as basel i of the basel committee in july 2013 the federal bank regulators approved final capital rules implementing the basel iii framework as well as certain provisions of the doddfrank act the basel iiibased us final rules substantially revised the riskbased capital requirements applicable to bank holding companies and their depository institution subsidiaries including the parent company cbna and cbpa as compared to the general riskbased capital rules the us basel iii final rules became effective for the parent company cbna and cbpa on january 1 2015 subject to a phasein period for certain provisions 

the us basel iii final rules among other things i introduced a new capital measure called common equity tier 1 capital or “cet1 capital” ii specified that tier 1 capital consists of cet1 capital and “additional tier 1 capital” instruments meeting certain revised requirements iii defined cet1 capital narrowly by requiring that most deductionsadjustments to regulatory capital measures be made to cet1 and not to the other components of capital and iv expanded the scope of the deductionsadjustments to capital as compared to existing regulations 

under the us basel iii final rules the minimum capital ratios are 

• 45 cet1 capital to riskweighted assets 

• 60 tier 1 capital that is cet1 capital plus additional tier 1 capital to riskweighted assets 

• 80 total capital that is tier 1 capital plus tier 2 capital to riskweighted assets and 

 the us basel iii final rules also introduced a new capital conservation buffer “ccb” composed entirely of cet1 capital on top of three minimum riskweighted asset ratios under existing rules the ccb when fully phasedin on january 1 2019 will be 25 banking institutions with a ratio of cet1 capital tier 1 capital or total capital to riskweighted assets below the effective minimum once the ccb is taken into account that is 70 85 and 105 for the three ratios respectively once the ccb is fullyphased in will be subject to constraints on capital distributions including dividends and share repurchases and certain discretionary executive compensation based on the amount of the shortfall the implementation of the ccb began on january 1 2016 at the 0625 level and will increase by 0625 on each subsequent january 1 until the buffer reaches its fully

phased in level of 25 on january 1 2019 for more details see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — capital” in part ii item 7 included in this report 

we are also subject to the frbs riskbased capital requirements for market risk see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — market risk — market risk regulatory capital” in part ii item 7 included in this report for further discussion 

the us basel iii final rules also provided for a number of deductions from and adjustments to cet1 capital for example these include the requirement that certain deferred tax assets and significant investments in nonconsolidated financial entities be deducted from cet1 capital to the extent that any one such category exceeds 10 of cet1 capital or all such items in the aggregate exceed 15 of cet1 capital implementation of the deductions and other adjustments to cet1 capital began on january 1 2015 and is being phasedin over a fouryear period beginning at 40 on january 1 2015 and adding an additional 20 in each year thereafter 

the us basel iii final rules prescribed a new standardized approach for risk weightings of assets that expanded the riskweighting categories from the general riskbased capital rules to a much larger and more risksensitive number of categories depending on the nature of the assets these categories generally range from 0 for us government and agency securities to 600 for certain equity exposures and result in higher risk weights for a variety of asset categories 

with respect to cbna and cbpa the us basel iii final rules also revise the “prompt corrective action” regulations pursuant to section 38 of the federal deposit insurance act as discussed below in “federal deposit insurance act” 

liquidity standards 

historically the frb evaluated our liquidity as part of the supervisory process without required formulaic measures liquidity risk management and supervision have become increasingly important since the 2008 financial crisis in september 2014 the frb occ and fdic issued a final rule to implement the basel iiibased us lcr which is a quantitative liquidity metric designed to ensure that a covered bank or bank holding company maintains an adequate level of unencumbered highquality liquid assets to cover expected net cash outflows over a 30day time horizon under an acute liquidity stress scenario the lcr rule as adopted applies in its most comprehensive form only to advanced approaches bank holding companies that is those with 250 billion or more in total consolidated assets or 10 billion or more in onbalance sheet foreign exposures and depository institutions subsidiaries of such bank holding companies and in a modified form to bank holding companies having 50 billion or more in total consolidated assets but less than the thresholds for the advanced approaches the us lcr differs in certain respects from the basel committee’s version of the lcr including a narrower definition of highquality liquid assets different prescribed cash inflow and outflow assumptions for certain types of instruments and transactions and a shorter phasein schedule that began on january 1 2015 as of january 1 2017 the rule has been fully phased in the modified lcr requires us to maintain a ratio of highquality liquid assets to 70 of net cash outflows compared to 100 in the comprehensive lcr for advanced approaches bank holding companies at december 31 2016 our lcr on the modified basis was above the minimum requirement 

as a modified lcr company we are required to calculate our lcr on a monthly basis if a covered company fails to meet the minimum required lcr it must promptly notify its primary federal banking regulator and may be required to take remedial actions in december 2016 the frb issued a final rule that requires bank holding companies to disclose publicly on a quarterly basis quantitative and qualitative information about certain components of our lcr beginning for modified lcr bank holding companies on october 1 2018 

the basel iii framework also included a second liquidity standard the nsfr which is designed to promote more medium and longterm funding of the assets and activities of banks over a oneyear time horizon in may 2016 the federal banking regulators issued a proposed rule that would implement the nsfr for large us banking organizations under the proposed rule the most stringent requirements would apply to advanced approaches bank holding companies and would require such organizations to maintain a minimum nsfr of 10 on an ongoing basis calculated by dividing the organization’s available stable funding “asf” by its required stable funding “rsf” bank holding companies with more than 50 billion but that are not advanced approaches bank holding companies would be subject to a modified nsfr requirement which would require such bank holding companies to maintain a minimum nsfr of 07 on an ongoing basis under the proposed rule a banking organization’s asf would be calculated by applying specified standard weightings to its equity and liabilities based on their expected stability over a oneyear time horizon and its rsf would be calculated by applying specified standardized weightings to its assets derivative exposures and commitments based on their liquidity characteristics over the same oneyear time horizon if implemented as proposed the nsfr rule would take effect on january 1 2018 we continue to evaluate the potential effects of this proposal on our operations 

finally per the liquidity rules included in the frb’s enhanced prudential standards adopted pursuant to section 165 of the doddfrank act referred to above under “—financial regulatory reform” we are required to maintain a buffer of highly liquid assets based on projected funding needs for 30 days the liquidity buffer is in addition to the federal banking regulators’ lcr rule and is described by the frb as being “complementary” to the lcr and nsfr

  capital planning and stress testing requirements 

bank holding companies with 50 billion or more in total consolidated assets are required to develop and maintain a capital plan and to submit the capital plan to the frb for review under its ccar process ccar is designed to evaluate the capital adequacy capital adequacy process and planned capital distributions such as dividend payments and common stock repurchases of a bank holding company subject to ccar as part of ccar the frb evaluates whether a bank holding company has sufficient capital to continue operations under various hypothetical scenarios of economic and financial market stress both bank holding company and frb developed including an “adverse” and “severely adverse” stress scenario developed by the federal reserve the frb will also evaluate whether the bank holding company has robust forwardlooking capital planning processes that account for its unique risks 

the capital plan must cover a “planning horizon” of at least nine quarters beginning with the quarter preceding the submission of the plan or january 1 2017 for the capital plans required to be filed on or before april 5 2017 bank holding companies are also subject to an ongoing requirement to revise and resubmit their capital plans upon the occurrence of certain events specified by rule or when required by the frb in addition to other limitations our ability to make any capital distributions including dividends and share repurchases is contingent on the frb’s nonobjection to our capital plan under quantitative tests requiring that we demonstrate that we will continue to meet all minimum capital requirements applicable to us over the ninequarter planning horizon under all applicable scenarios for capital plans in ccar submissions before the april 5 2017 submission the frb was able to object to the capital plan of any bank holding company subject to ccar under quantitative tests as well as qualitative tests such as concerns with the assumptions analysis or methodologies of the capital plan 

the frb recently amended its capital plan rule to eliminate its ability to object to the capital plan of a “large and noncomplex” bank holding company that is one that has less than 250 billion in total consolidated assets less than 75 billion in nonbank assets and that is not classified as a global systemically important bank holding company under the frb’s capital rules on qualitative grounds however the frb will incorporate an assessment of the qualitative aspects of the firm’s capital planning process into regular ongoing supervisory activities and through targeted horizontal assessments of particular aspects of capital planning 

should the frb object to a capital plan a bank holding company may not make any capital distribution other than those capital distributions that the frb has indicated its nonobjection to in writing participating firms are required to submit their capital plans and stress testing results to the frb on or before april 5 th  of each year and the frb will publish the results of its supervisory ccar review of submitted capital plans by june 30 th  of each year in addition the frb will separately publish the results of its supervisory stress test under both the supervisory severely adverse and adverse scenarios the information to be released will include among other things the frb’s projection of companyspecific information including poststress capital ratios and the minimum value of these ratios over the planning horizon 

the frb’s capital planning and stress testing rules generally limit our ability to make quarterly capital distributionsthat is dividends and share repurchasesif the amount of our actual cumulative quarterly capital issuances of instruments that qualify as regulatory capital are less than we had indicated in our submitted capital plan as to which we receive a nonobjection from the frb due to the importance and intensity of the stress tests and the ccar process we have dedicated significant resources to comply with stress testing and capital planning requirements and expect to continue to do so in the future 

standards for safety and soundness 

the fdia requires the frb occ and fdic to prescribe operational and managerial standards for all insured depository institutions including cbna and cbpa the agencies have adopted regulations and interagency guidelines which set forth the safety and soundness standards used to identify and address problems at insured depository institutions before capital becomes impaired if an agency determines that a bank fails to satisfy any standard it may require the bank to submit an acceptable plan to achieve compliance consistent with deadlines for the submission and review of such safety and soundness compliance plans if after being notified to submit a compliance plan an institution fails to submit an acceptable compliance plan or fails in any material respect to implement an acceptable compliance plan the agency must issue an order directing action to correct the deficiency and may issue an order directing other actions of the types to which an undercapitalized institution is subject under the fdia see “federal deposit insurance act” below if an institution fails to comply with such an order the agency may seek to enforce such order in judicial proceedings and to impose civil money penalties 

cbpa is also subject to supervision by the pa banking department the pa banking department may order any pennsylvaniachartered savings bank to discontinue any violation of law or unsafe or unsound business practice it may also order the termination of any trustee officer attorney or employee of a savings bank engaged in objectionable activity 

federal deposit insurance act 

the fdia requires among other things that the federal banking regulators take “prompt corrective action” with respect to depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements as described above in “capital” the fdia sets forth 

citizens financial group inc 

business 

the following five capital categories “wellcapitalized” “adequately capitalized” “undercapitalized” “significantly undercapitalized” and “critically undercapitalized” the federal banking regulators must take certain mandatory supervisory actions and are authorized to take other discretionary actions with respect to institutions which are undercapitalized significantly undercapitalized or critically undercapitalized with the actions becoming more restrictive and punitive the lower the institution’s capital category a depository institution’s capital category will depend upon how its capital levels compare with various relevant capital measures and certain other factors that are established by regulation and the severity of mandatory and discretionary supervisory actions depends upon the capital category in which the institution is placed under existing rules an institution that is not an advanced approaches institution is deemed to be “well capitalized” if it has i a cet1 ratio of at least 65 ii a tier 1 capital ratio of at least 8 iii a total capital ratio of at least 10 and iv a tier 1 leverage ratio of at least 5 

the fdia’s prompt corrective action provisions only apply to depository institutions and not to bank holding companies the frb’s regulations applicable to bank holding companies separately define “well capitalized” for bank holding companies to require maintaining a tier 1 capital ratio of at least 6 and a total capital ratio of at least 10 as described above under “—financial holding company regulation” a financial holding company that is not wellcapitalized and wellmanaged or whose bank subsidiaries are not well capitalized and well managed under applicable prompt corrective action standards may be restricted in certain of its activities and ultimately may lose financial holding company status 

as of december 31 2016 the parent company cbna and cbpa were wellcapitalized 

the fdia prohibits insured banks from accepting brokered deposits or offering interest rates on any deposits significantly higher than the prevailing rate in the bank’s normal market area or nationally depending upon where the deposits are solicited unless it is “wellcapitalized” or it is “adequately capitalized” and receives a waiver from the fdic a bank that is “adequately capitalized” and that accepts brokered deposits under a waiver from the fdic may not pay an interest rate on any deposit in excess of 75 basis points over certain prevailing market rates the fdia imposes no such restrictions on a bank that is “wellcapitalized” 

deposit insurance 

the fdia requires cbna and cbpa to pay deposit insurance assessments fdic assessment rates for large institutions are calculated based on one of two scorecards one for most large institutions that have more than 10 billion in assets and another for “highly complex” institutions that have over 50 billion in assets and are fully owned by a parent with over 500 billion in assets each scorecard has a performance score and a lossseverity score that are combined to produce a total score which is translated into an initial assessment rate in calculating these scores the fdic utilizes the camels ratings as well as forwardlooking financial measures to assess an institution’s ability to withstand assetrelated stress and fundingrelated stress the fdic has the ability to make discretionary adjustments to the total score up or down based upon significant risk factors that are not adequately captured in the scorecard the total score is then translated to an initial base assessment rate on a nonlinear sharplyincreasing scale as of july 1 2016 for large institutions the initial base assessment rate ranges from 3 to 30 basis points on an annualized basis basis points representing cents per 100 after the effect of potential baserate adjustments the total base assessment rate could range from 15 to 40 basis points on an annualized basis 

the deposit insurance assessment is calculated based on average consolidated total assets less average tangible equity of the insured depository institution during the assessment period deposit insurance assessments are also affected by the minimum reserve ratio with respect to the deposit insurance fund “dif” in march 2016 the fdic issued a final rule that imposes on insured depository institutions with at least 10 billion in assets including cbna and cbpa a surcharge of 45 basis points per annum until the earlier of the quarter that the dif reaches the required reserve ratio of 135 and december 31 2018 which the fdic estimates will take approximately two years under the rule if the reserve ratio does not reach 135 by december 31 2018 the fdic will impose a shortfall assessment on larger depository institutions including cbna and cbpa in the first quarter of 2019 to be collected on june 30 2019 the rule has resulted in higher deposit insurance assessments for both cbna and cbpa 

under the fdia banks may also be held liable by the fdic for certain losses incurred or reasonably expected to be incurred by the dif either cbna or cbpa may be liable for losses caused by the other’s default and also may be liable for any assistance provided by the fdic to the other if in danger of default 

dividends 

various federal and statutory provisions and regulations as well as regulatory expectations limit the amount of dividends that we and our subsidiaries may pay 

our payment of dividends to our stockholders is subject to the oversight of the frb in particular the dividend policies and share repurchases of a large bank holding company are reviewed by the frb based on capital plans submitted as part of the ccar process and stress tests as submitted by the bank holding company as discussed above and will be assessed against among other things the bank holding company’s ability to achieve the required capital ratios under the basel iii based us revised capital rules as they are phased in by us regulators in addition to other limitations our ability to make any capital distributions including 

citizens financial group inc 

business 

dividends and share repurchases is contingent on the frb’s nonobjection to such planned distributions included in our submitted capital plan see “capital” and “capital planning and stress testing requirements” above 

dividends payable by cbna as a national bank subsidiary are limited to the lesser of the amount calculated under a “recent earnings” test and an “undivided profits” test under the recent earnings test a dividend may not be paid if the total of all dividends declared by a bank in any calendar year is in excess of the current year’s net income combined with the retained net income of the two preceding years less any required transfers to surplus unless the national bank obtains the approval of the occ under the undivided profits test a dividend may not be paid in excess of the entity’s “undivided profits” generally accumulated net profits that have not been paid out as dividends or transferred to surplus federal bank regulatory agencies have issued policy statements which provide that fdicinsured depository institutions and their holding companies should generally pay dividends only out of their current operating earnings under pennsylvania law cbpa may declare and pay dividends only out of accumulated net earnings and only if i any required transfer to surplus has been made prior to declaration of the dividend and ii payment of the dividend will not reduce surplus 

support of subsidiary banks 

under section 616 of the doddfrank act which codifies the frb’s longstanding “source of strength” doctrine we must serve as a source of financial and managerial strength for our depository institution subsidiaries the statute defines “source of financial strength” as the ability to provide financial assistance in the event of the financial distress at the insured depository institution the frb may require that we provide such support at times even when we may not have the financial resources to do so or when doing so may not serve our interests or those of our shareholders or creditors in addition any capital loans by a bank holding company to its subsidiary bank are subordinate in right of payment to deposits and to certain other indebtedness of such subsidiary bank in the event of a bank holding company’s bankruptcy any commitment by the bank holding company to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to a priority of payment 

transactions with affiliates and insiders 

sections 23a and 23b of the federal reserve act and related frb rules including its regulation w restrict our bank subsidiaries from extending credit to or engaging in certain other transactions with us and our nonbank subsidiaries these restrictions place limits on certain specified “covered transactions” between these subsidiary banks and their affiliates which must be limited to 10 of a bank’s capital and surplus for any one affiliate and 20 for all affiliates furthermore within the foregoing limitations as to amount certain covered transactions must meet specified collateral requirements ranging from 100 to 130 covered transactions are defined to include among other things a loan or extension of credit as well as a purchase of securities issued by an affiliate a purchase of assets unless otherwise exempted by the frb from the affiliate the acceptance of securities issued by the affiliate as collateral for a loan derivatives transactions and securities lending transactions where the bank has credit exposure to an affiliate and the issuance of a guarantee acceptance or letter of credit on behalf of an affiliate all covered transactions including certain additional transactions such as transactions with a third party in which an affiliate has a financial interest must be conducted on market terms the doddfrank act significantly enhanced and expanded the scope and coverage of these limitations in particular by including within its scope derivative transactions by and between cbna or cbpa or their subsidiaries and the parent company or its other subsidiaries the federal reserve enforces these restrictions and we are audited for compliance 

section 23b prohibits an institution from engaging in certain transactions with affiliates unless the transactions are on terms substantially the same or at least as favorable to the bank as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with nonaffiliated companies except for limitations on lowquality asset purchases and transactions that are deemed to be unsafe or unsound regulation w generally excludes affiliated depository institutions from treatment as affiliates transactions between a bank and any of its subsidiaries that are engaged in certain financial activities may be subject to the affiliated transaction limits the frb also may designate banking subsidiaries as affiliates 

pursuant to frb regulation o we are also subject to quantitative restrictions on extensions of credit to executive officers directors principal stockholders and their related interests in general such extensions of credit i may not exceed certain dollar limitations ii must be made on substantially the same terms including interest rates and collateral as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with third parties and iii must not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features certain extensions of credit also require the approval of our board 

  volcker rule 

the doddfrank act prohibits banks and their affiliates from engaging in proprietary trading and investing in sponsoring and having certain relationships with private funds such as hedge funds or private equity funds that would be an investment company for purposes of the investment company act of 1940 but for the exclusions in sections 3c1 or 3c7 of that act both subject to certain limited exceptions the statutory provision is commonly called the “volcker rule” in december 2013 the frb occ fdic the sec and the cftc issued final rules to implement the volcker rule which became effective in july 2015 the 

citizens financial group inc 

business 

final rules also require that large bank holding companies design and implement compliance programs to ensure adherence to the volcker rule’s prohibitions development and monitoring of the required compliance program may require the expenditure of resources and management attention 

consumer financial protection regulations 

the retail activities of banks are subject to a variety of statutes and regulations designed to protect consumers and promote lending to various sectors of the economy and population these laws include but are not limited to the equal credit opportunity act the fair debt collection act the fair credit reporting act the truth in lending act the home mortgage disclosure act the service members civil relief act the expected funds availability act the right to financial privacy act the truth in savings act the electronic funds transfer act and their respective federal regulations and state law counterparts 

in addition to these federal laws and regulations the guidance and interpretations of the various federal agencies charged with the responsibility of implementing such regulations also influences loan and deposit operations 

the cfpb has broad rulemaking supervisory examination and enforcement authority over various consumer financial protection laws including the laws referenced above fair lending laws and certain other statutes the cfpb also has examination and primary enforcement authority with respect to depository institutions with 10 billion or more in assets including the authority to prevent unfair deceptive or abusive practices in connection with the offering of consumer financial products 

the doddfrank act permits states to adopt stricter consumer protection laws and standards that are more stringent than those adopted at the federal level and in certain circumstances permits state attorneys general to enforce compliance with both the state and federal laws and regulations state regulation of financial products and potential enforcement actions could also adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

the cfpb has finalized a number of significant rules which will impact nearly every aspect of the life cycle of a residential mortgage the final rules require banks to among other things i develop and implement procedures to ensure compliance with a new “ability to repay” standard and identify whether a loan meets a new definition for a “qualified mortgage” ii implement new or revised disclosures policies and procedures for servicing mortgages including but not limited to early intervention with delinquent borrowers and specific loss mitigation procedures for loans secured by a borrower’s principal residence iii comply with additional restrictions on mortgage loan originator hiring and compensation iv comply with new disclosure requirements and standards for appraisals and certain financial products and v maintain escrow accounts for “higher priced mortgage loans” for a longer period of time we are continuing to analyze the impact that such rules have on our business 

in addition we and our banking subsidiaries are currently subject to consent orders issued in 2015 by certain of our regulators in connection with past deposit reconciliation and billing practices under which the applicable regulators have provided nonobjections to among other things restitution plans for affected customers all financial penalties associated with these regulatory enforcement matters have been paid and substantially all remediation related to such legacy matters was resolved as of december 31 2016 

protection of customer personal information and cybersecurity 

the privacy provisions of glba generally prohibit financial institutions including us from disclosing nonpublic personal financial information of consumer customers to third parties for certain purposes primarily marketing unless customers have the opportunity to optout of the disclosure the fair credit reporting act restricts information sharing among affiliates for marketing purposes both the fair credit reporting act and regulation v issued by the frb govern the use and provision of information to consumer reporting agencies 

in march 2015 federal regulators issued two related statements regarding cybersecurity one statement indicates that financial institutions should design multiple layers of security controls to establish lines of defense and to ensure that their risk management processes also address the risk posed by compromised customer credentials including security measures to reliably authenticate customers accessing internetbased services of the financial institution the other statement indicates that a financial institution’s management is expected to maintain sufficient business continuity planning processes to ensure the rapid recovery resumption and maintenance of the institution’s operations after a cyber attack involving destructive malware a financial institution is also expected to develop appropriate processes to enable recovery of data and business operations and address rebuilding network capabilities and restoring data if the institution or its critical service providers fall victim to this type of cyber attack if we fail to observe the regulatory guidance we could be subject to various regulatory sanctions including financial penalties for a further discussion of risks related to cybersecurity see “risk factors” in part i item 1a included in this report 

in october 2016 federal regulators jointly issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking on enhanced cyber risk management standards that are intended to increase the operational resilience of large and interconnected entities under their supervision once established the enhanced cyber risk management standards would help to reduce the potential impact of a cyberattack or other cyberrelated failure on the financial system the advance notice of proposed rulemaking addresses five categories of cyber standards 1 cyber risk governance 2 cyber risk management 3 internal dependency management 4 external

community reinvestment act requirements 

the cra requires banking regulators to evaluate us and our banking subsidiaries in meeting the credit needs of our local communities including providing credit to individuals residing in low and moderate income neighborhoods the cra requires each appropriate federal bank regulatory agency in connection with its examination of a depository institution to assess such institution’s record in assessing and meeting the credit needs of the community served by that institution and assign ratings the regulatory agency’s assessment of the institution’s record is made available to the public these evaluations are also considered in evaluating mergers acquisitions and applications to open a branch or facility and in the case of a bank holding company that has elected financial holding company status a cra rating of “satisfactory” is required to commence certain new financial activities or to acquire a company engaged in such activities we received a rating of “satisfactory” in our mostrecent cra evaluation 

compensation 

our compensation practices are subject to oversight by the frb the federal banking regulators have provided guidance designed to ensure that incentive compensation arrangements at banking organizations take into account risk and are consistent with safe and sound practices the guidance sets forth the following three key principles with respect to incentive compensation arrangements i the arrangements should provide employees with incentives that appropriately balance risk and financial results in a manner that does not encourage employees to expose their organizations to imprudent risk ii the arrangements should be compatible with effective controls and risk management and iii the arrangements should be supported by strong corporate governance the guidance provides that supervisory findings with respect to incentive compensation will be incorporated as appropriate into the organization’s supervisory ratings which can affect its ability to make acquisitions or perform other actions the guidance also provides that enforcement actions may be taken against a banking organization if its incentive compensation arrangements or related risk management control or governance processes pose a risk to the organization’s safety and soundness 

during the second quarter of 2016 the us financial regulators including the frb and the sec proposed revised rules on incentivebased payment arrangements at specified regulated entities having at least 1 billion in total assets including the parent company and cbna the proposed revised rules would establish general qualitative requirements applicable to all covered entities additional specific requirements for entities with total consolidated assets of at least 50 billion and further more stringent requirements for those with total consolidated assets of at least 250 billion the general qualitative requirements include i prohibiting incentive arrangements that encourage inappropriate risks by providing excessive compensation ii prohibiting incentive arrangements that encourage inappropriate risks that could lead to a material financial loss iii establishing requirements for performance measures to appropriately balance risk and reward iv requiring board of director oversight of incentive arrangements and v mandating appropriate recordkeeping for larger financial institutions the proposed revised rules would also introduce additional requirements applicable only to “senior executive officers” and “significant risktakers” as defined in the proposed rules including i limits on performance measures and leverage relating to performance targets ii minimum deferral periods and iii subjecting incentive compensation to possible downward adjustment forfeiture and clawback if the rules are adopted in the form proposed they may restrict our flexibility with respect to the manner in which we structure compensation and adversely affect our ability to compete for talent 

antimoney laundering 

the usa patriot act enacted in 2001 and renewed in 2006 substantially broadened the scope of us antimoney laundering laws and regulations by imposing significant new compliance and due diligence obligations creating new crimes and penalties and expanding the extraterritorial jurisdiction of the united states institutions must maintain antimoney laundering programs that include established internal policies procedures and controls a designated compliance officer an ongoing employee training program and testing of the program by an independent audit function we are prohibited from entering into specified financial transactions and account relationships and must meet enhanced standards for due diligence in dealings with foreign financial institutions and foreign customers we also must take reasonable steps to conduct enhanced scrutiny of account relationships to guard against money laundering and to report any suspicious transactions recent laws provide law enforcement authorities with increased access to financial information maintained by banks 

the usa patriot act also provides for the facilitation of information sharing among governmental entities and financial institutions for the purpose of combating terrorism and money laundering the statute also creates enhanced information collection tools and enforcement mechanics for the us government including i requiring standards for verifying customer identification at account opening ii promulgating rules to promote cooperation among financial institutions regulators and law enforcement entities in identifying parties that may be involved in terrorism or money laundering iii requiring reports by nonfinancial trades and businesses filed with the treasury’s financial crimes enforcement network “fincen” for transactions exceeding 10000 and iv mandating the filing of suspicious activities reports if a bank believes a customer may be violating us laws and regulations the statute also requires enhanced due diligence requirements for financial institutions that administer maintain or manage private

in 2014 fincen which drafts regulations implementing the usa patriot act and other antimoney laundering and bank secrecy act legislation proposed a rule that would require financial institutions to obtain beneficial ownership information with respect to legal entities with which such institutions conduct business subject to certain exclusions and exemptions in may 2016 fincen issued its final rules with respect to customer due diligence requirements and financial institutions that are subject to these final rules are required to comply by may 2018 bank regulators are focusing their examinations on antimoney laundering compliance and we continue to monitor and augment where necessary our antimoney laundering compliance programs 

office of foreign assets control regulation 

the us has imposed economic sanctions that affect transactions with designated foreign countries nationals and others these are typically known as the “ofac” rules based on their administration by the us treasury department office of foreign assets control the ofacadministered sanctions targeting countries take many different forms generally however they contain one or more of the following elements i restrictions on trade with or investment in a sanctioned country including prohibitions against direct or indirect imports from and exports to a sanctioned country and prohibitions on us persons engaging in financial transactions relating to making investments in or providing investmentrelated advice or assistance to a sanctioned country and ii a blocking of assets in which the government or specially designated nationals of the sanctioned country have an interest by prohibiting transfers of property subject to us jurisdiction including property in the possession or control of us persons blocked assets eg property and bank deposits cannot be paid out withdrawn set off or transferred in any manner without a license from ofac ofac publishes and routinely updates lists of names of persons and organizations suspected of aiding harboring or engaging in terrorist acts including the specially designated nationals and blocked persons we are responsible for among other things blocking accounts of and transactions with such targets and countries prohibiting unlicensed trade and financial transactions with them and reporting blocked transactions after their occurrence if we find a name on any transaction account or wire transfer that is on an ofac list we must freeze such account file a suspicious activity report and notify the appropriate authorities failure to comply with these sanctions could have serious legal and reputational consequences 

regulation of brokerdealers

  heightened risk governance standards 

in september 2014 the occ finalized guidelines that establish heightened governance standards for large national banks with average total consolidated assets of 50 billion or more including cbna the guidelines set forth minimum standards for the design and implementation of a bank’s risk governance framework and minimum standards for oversight of that framework by a bank’s board of directors the guidelines are an extension of the occ’s “heightened expectations” for large banks that the occ began informally communicating to certain banks in 2010 the guidelines are intended to protect the safety and soundness of covered banks and improve bank examiners’ ability to assess compliance with the occ’s expectations under the guidelines a bank could use certain components of its parent company’s risk governance framework but the framework must ensure that the bank’s risk profile is easily distinguished and separate from the parent for risk management and supervisory purposes a bank’s board of directors is required to have two members who are independent of the bank and parent company management a bank’s board of directors is responsible for ensuring that the risk governance framework meets the standards in the guidelines providing active oversight and a credible challenge to management’s recommendations and decisions and ensuring that the parent company decisions do not jeopardize the safety and soundness of the bank

commercial real estate lending 

lending operations that involve concentrations of commercial real estate loans are subject to enhanced scrutiny by federal banking regulators regulators have advised financial institutions of the risks posed by commercial real estate lending concentrations such loans generally include land development construction loans and loans secured by multifamily property and nonfarm nonresidential real property where the primary source of repayment is derived from rental income associated with the property the relevant regulatory guidance prescribes the following guidelines for examiners to help identify institutions that are potentially exposed to concentration risk and may warrant greater supervisory scrutiny 

 in addition the doddfrank act contains provisions that may cause us to reduce the amount of our commercial real estate lending and increase the cost of borrowing including rules relating to risk retention of securitized assets section 941 of the doddfrank act and implementing rules adopted by the us financial services regulators including the federal banking regulators and the sec require among other things a loan originator or a securitizer of assetbacked securities to retain a percentage of the credit risk of securitized assets 

  other regulatory matters 

we and our subsidiaries and affiliates are subject to numerous examinations by federal and state banking regulators as well as the sec finra and various state insurance and securities regulators in some cases regulatory agencies may take supervisory actions that may not be publicly disclosed and such actions may restrict or limit our activities or activities of our subsidiaries as part of our regular examination process our and our banking subsidiaries’ respective regulators may advise us or our banking subsidiaries to operate under various restrictions as a prudential matter we and our subsidiaries have periodically received requests for information from regulatory authorities at the federal and state level including from state insurance commissions state attorneys general federal agencies or law enforcement authorities securities regulators and other regulatory authorities concerning their business practices such requests are considered incidental to the normal conduct of business 

in order to remedy certain weaknesses including weaknesses cited by our regulators and to meet our significant regulatory and supervisory challenges we believe we need to continue to make improvements to our processes systems and controls we expect to continue to dedicate significant resources and managerial time and attention to and to make significant investments in enhanced processes systems and controls this may increase our operational costs and limit our ability to implement aspects of our strategic plan or otherwise pursue certain business opportunities we also expect to make restitution payments to our banking subsidiaries’ customers which could be significant arising from certain customer compliance deficiencies and may be required to pay civil money penalties in connection with certain of these deficiencies we have established reserves in respect of these future payments but the amounts that we are ultimately obligated to pay could be in excess of our reserves moreover if we are unsuccessful in remedying these weaknesses and meeting the enhanced supervisory requirements and expectations that apply to us and our banking subsidiaries we could remain subject to existing restrictions or become subject to additional restrictions on our activities supervisory actions or public enforcement actions including the payment of civil money penalties

our strategic plan which we began to implement in the second half of 2013 involves four principal elements i increasing revenue in both consumer banking and commercial banking ii enhancing cost reduction efforts across the company iii taking capital actions aimed at better aligning our capital structure with those of regional bank peers and iv the beneficial impact of a rising interest rate environment on our assetsensitive balance sheet our future success and the value of our stock will depend in part on our ability to effectively implement our strategic plan there are risks and uncertainties many of which are not within our control associated with each element of our plan in addition certain of our key initiatives require regulatory approval which may not be obtained on a timely basis if at all moreover even if we do obtain required regulatory approval it may be conditioned on certain organizational changes such as those discussed below that could reduce the profitability of those initiatives if we are not able to successfully execute our strategic plan we may never achieve our indicative performance targets and any shortfall may be material 

in addition to the four principal elements of our strategic plan we also anticipate that our rotce will be affected by a number of additional factors we anticipate a benefit to our rotce from run off of our noncore portfolio which we expect will be offset by the negative impact on our rotce of some deterioration in the credit environment as it returns to historical levels and a decline in gains on investment securities we do not control many aspects of these factors or others and actual results could differ from our expectations materially which could impair our ability to achieve our strategic rotce goals see “business strategy” in part i item 1 — business  included in this report for further information 

supervisory requirements and expectations on us as a financial holding company and a bank holding company our need to make improvements and devote resources to various aspects of our controls processes policies and procedures and any regulatorimposed limits on our activities could limit our ability to implement our strategic plan expand our business improve our financial performance and make capital distributions to our stockholders 

as a result of and in addition to new legislation aimed at regulatory reform such as the doddfrank act and the increased capital and liquidity requirements introduced by the us implementation of the basel iii framework the capital components and the lcr as one of the two key liquidity components which have become effective the federal banking agencies the frb the occ and the fdic as well as the cfpb generally are taking a more stringent approach to supervising and regulating financial institutions and financial products and services over which they exercise their respective supervisory authorities we our two banking subsidiaries and our products and services are all subject to greater supervisory scrutiny and enhanced supervisory requirements and expectations we expect to continue to face greater supervisory scrutiny and enhanced supervisory requirements in the foreseeable future 

we also have been required to make improvements to our overall compliance and operational risk management programs and practices in order to comply with enhanced supervisory requirements and expectations and to address weaknesses in retail credit risk management liquidity risk management model risk management outsourcing and vendor risk management and related oversight and monitoring practices and tools our and our banking subsidiaries’ consumer compliance program and controls are being enhanced in a variety of areas including processes relating to fair lending and mortgage servicing and origination in addition to the foregoing as part of the supervisory and examination process from time to time we and our banking subsidiaries may become and currently are subject to prudential restrictions on our activities similarly under the bank holding company act currently we may not be able to engage in certain categories of new activities or acquire shares or control of other companies other than in connection with internal reorganizations

risk factors 

while we have made significant progress in enhancing our compliance and risk programs if we are unsuccessful in remedying these weaknesses and meeting the enhanced supervisory requirements and expectations that apply to us and our banking subsidiaries we could remain subject to existing restrictions or become subject to additional restrictions on our activities informal nonpublic or formal public supervisory actions or public enforcement actions including the payment of civil money penalties any such actions or restrictions if and in whatever manner imposed would likely increase our costs and could limit our ability to implement our strategic plans and expand our business and as a result could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations for more information regarding ongoing regulatory actions in which we are involved and certain identified past practices and policies for which we faced formal administrative enforcement actions see note 17 “commitments and contingencies” and note 20 “regulatory matters” to our audited consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 — financial statements and supplementary data included in this report for further discussion 

a continuation of the current low interest rate environment or subsequent movements in interest rates may have an adverse effect on our profitability 

net interest income historically has been and in the neartomedium term we anticipate that it will remain a significant component of our total revenue this is due to the fact that a high percentage of our assets and liabilities have been and will likely continue to be in the form of interestbearing or interestrelated instruments changes in interest rates can have a material effect on many areas of our business including net interest income deposit costs loan volume and delinquency and value of our mortgage servicing rights interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond our control including general economic conditions and policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies and in particular the federal open market committee changes in monetary policy including changes in interest rates could influence not only the interest we receive on loans and securities and the amount of interest we pay on deposits and borrowings but such changes could also affect our ability to originate loans and obtain deposits and the fair value of our financial assets and liabilities if the interest rates on our interestbearing liabilities increase at a faster pace than the interest rates on our interest earning assets our net interest income may decline and with it a decline in our earnings may occur our net interest income and our earnings would be similarly affected if the interest rates on our interest earning assets declined at a faster pace than the interest rates on our interestbearing liabilities 

we cannot control or predict with certainty changes in interest rates global national regional and local economic conditions competitive pressures and the policies of regulatory authorities including monetary policies of the frb affect interest income and interest expense although we have policies and procedures designed to manage the risks associated with changes in market interest rates as further discussed under “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — risk governance” in part ii item 7 included in this report changes in interest rates still may have an adverse effect on our profitability 

if our ongoing assumptions regarding borrower behavior are wrong or overall economic conditions are significantly different than we anticipate then our risk mitigation may be insufficient to protect against interest rate risk and our net income would be adversely affected 

we could fail to attract retain or motivate highly skilled and qualified personnel including our senior management other key employees or members of our board which could impair our ability to successfully execute our strategic plan and otherwise adversely affect our business 

a cornerstone of our strategic plan involves the hiring of highly skilled and qualified personnel accordingly our ability to implement our strategic plan and our future success depends on our ability to attract retain and motivate highly skilled and qualified personnel including our senior management and other key employees and directors competitive with our peers the marketplace for skilled personnel is becoming more competitive which means the cost of hiring incentivizing and retaining skilled personnel may continue to increase the failure to attract or retain including as a result of an untimely death or illness of key personnel or replace a sufficient number of appropriately skilled and key personnel could place us at a significant competitive disadvantage and prevent us from successfully implementing our strategy which could impair our ability to implement our strategic plan successfully achieve our performance targets and otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

in may 2016 the frb other federal banking agencies and the securities and exchange commission jointly published reproposed rules originally proposed in april 2011 designed to implement provisions of the doddfrank act prohibiting incentive compensation arrangements that would encourage inappropriate risk taking at covered financial institutions which includes a bank or bank holding company with 1 billion or more of assets although the reproposed rules include more stringent requirements particularly for larger institutions it cannot be determined at this time whether or when a final rule will be adopted compliance with such a final rule may substantially affect the manner in which we structure compensation for our executives and other employees depending on the nature and application of the final rules we may not be able to successfully compete with certain financial institutions and other companies that are not subject to some or all of the rules to retain and attract executives and other high performing employees if this were to occur our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely

affected perhaps materially for a more detailed discussion of these proposed rules see “regulation and supervision” in part i item 1 — business included in this report 

our ability to meet our obligations and the cost of funds to do so depend on our ability to access sources of liquidity and the particular sources available to us 

liquidity risk is the risk that we will not be able to meet our obligations including funding commitments as they come due this risk is inherent in our operations and can be heightened by a number of factors including an overreliance on a particular source of funding including for example secured fhlb advances changes in credit ratings or marketwide phenomena such as market dislocation and major disasters like many banking groups our reliance on customer deposits to meet a considerable portion of our funding has grown over recent years and we continue to seek to increase the proportion of our funding represented by customer deposits however these deposits are subject to fluctuation due to certain factors outside our control such as a loss of confidence by customers in us or in the banking sector generally increasing competitive pressures for retail or corporate customer deposits changes in interest rates and returns on other investment classes which could result in a significant outflow of deposits within a short period of time to the extent there is heightened competition among us banks for retail customer deposits this competition may increase the cost of procuring new deposits andor retaining existing deposits and otherwise negatively affect our ability to grow our deposit base an inability to grow or any material decrease in our deposits could have a material adverse effect on our ability to satisfy our liquidity needs 

maintaining a diverse and appropriate funding strategy for our assets consistent with our wider strategic risk appetite and plan remains challenging and any tightening of credit markets could have a material adverse impact on us in particular there is a risk that corporate and financial institution counterparties may seek to reduce their credit exposures to banks and other financial institutions for example reductions in unsecured deposits supplied by these counterparties which may cause funding from these sources to no longer be available under these circumstances we may need to seek funds from alternative sources potentially at higher costs than has previously been the case or may be required to consider disposals of other assets not previously identified for disposal in order to reduce our funding commitments 

a reduction in our credit ratings which are based on a number of factors could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

credit ratings affect the cost and other terms upon which we are able to obtain funding rating agencies regularly evaluate us and their ratings are based on a number of factors including our financial strength other factors considered by rating agencies include conditions affecting the financial services industry generally any downgrade in our ratings would likely increase our borrowing costs could limit our access to capital markets and otherwise adversely affect our business for example a ratings downgrade could adversely affect our ability to sell or market certain of our securities including longterm debt engage in certain longerterm derivatives transactions and retain our customers particularly corporate customers who may require a minimum rating threshold in order to place funds with us in addition under the terms of certain of our derivatives contracts we may be required to maintain a minimum credit rating or have to post additional collateral or terminate such contracts any of these results of a rating downgrade could increase our cost of funding reduce our liquidity and have adverse effects on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our financial performance may be adversely affected by deterioration in borrower credit quality particularly in the new england midatlantic and midwest regions where our operations are concentrated 

we have exposure to many different industries and risks arising from actual or perceived changes in credit quality and uncertainty over the recoverability of amounts due from borrowers is inherent in our businesses our exposure may be exacerbated by the geographic concentration of our operations which are predominately located in the new england midatlantic and midwest regions the credit quality of our borrowers may deteriorate for a number of reasons that are outside our control including as a result of prevailing economic and market conditions and asset valuation the trends and risks affecting borrower credit quality particularly in the new england midatlantic and midwest regions have caused and in the future may cause us to experience impairment charges increased repurchase demands higher costs additional writedowns and losses and an inability to engage in routine funding transactions which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our framework for managing risks may not be effective in mitigating risk and loss 

our risk management framework is made up of various processes and strategies to manage our risk exposure the framework to manage risk including the framework’s underlying assumptions may not be effective under all conditions and circumstances if the risk management framework proves ineffective we could suffer unexpected losses and could be materially adversely affected 

citizens financial group inc 

risk factors 

one of the main types of risks inherent in our business is credit risk an important feature of our credit risk management system is to employ an internal credit risk control system through which we identify measure monitor and mitigate existing and emerging credit risk of our customers as this process involves detailed analyses of the customer or credit risk taking into account both quantitative and qualitative factors it is subject to human error in exercising their judgment our employees may not always be able to assign an accurate credit rating to a customer or credit risk which may result in our exposure to higher credit risks than indicated by our risk rating system 

in addition we have undertaken certain actions to enhance our credit policies and guidelines to address potential risks associated with particular industries or types of customers as discussed in more detail under “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — risk governance” and “— market risk” in part ii item 7 included in this report however we may not be able to effectively implement these initiatives or consistently follow and refine our credit risk management system if any of the foregoing were to occur it may result in an increase in the level of nonperforming loans and a higher risk exposure for us which could have a material adverse effect on us 

our financial and accounting estimates and risk management framework rely on analytical forecasting and models 

the processes we use to estimate our inherent loan losses and to measure the fair value of financial instruments as well as the processes used to estimate the effects of changing interest rates and other market measures on our financial condition and results of operations depends upon the use of analytical and forecasting models some of our tools and metrics for managing risk are based upon our use of observed historical market behavior we rely on quantitative models to measure risks and to estimate certain financial values models may be used in such processes as determining the pricing of various products grading loans and extending credit measuring interest rate and other market risks predicting losses assessing capital adequacy and calculating regulatory capital levels as well as estimating the value of financial instruments and balance sheet items poorly designed or implemented models present the risk that our business decisions based on information incorporating such models will be adversely affected due to the inadequacy of that information moreover our models may fail to predict future risk exposures if the information used in the model is incorrect obsolete or not sufficiently comparable to actual events as they occur we seek to incorporate appropriate historical data in our models but the range of market values and behaviors reflected in any period of historical data is not at all times predictive of future developments in any particular period and the period of data we incorporate into our models may turn out to be inappropriate for the future period being modeled in such case our ability to manage risk would be limited and our risk exposure and losses could be significantly greater than our models indicated in addition if existing or potential customers believe our risk management is inadequate they could take their business elsewhere this could harm our reputation as well as our revenues and profits finally information we provide to our regulators based on poorly designed or implemented models could also be inaccurate or misleading some of the decisions that our regulators make including those related to capital distributions to our stockholders could be affected adversely due to their perception that the quality of the models used to generate the relevant information is insufficient 

the preparation of our financial statements requires the use of estimates that may vary from actual results particularly various factors may cause our alll to increase 

the preparation of audited consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make significant estimates that affect the financial statements our most critical accounting estimate is the alll the alll is a reserve established through a provision for loan and lease losses charged to expense and represents our estimate of incurred but unrealized losses within the existing portfolio of loans the alll is necessary to reserve for estimated loan and lease losses and risks inherent in the loan portfolio the level of the alll reflects our ongoing evaluation of industry concentrations specific credit risks loan and lease loss experience current loan portfolio quality present economic political and regulatory conditions and incurred losses inherent in the current loan portfolio 

the determination of the appropriate level of the alll inherently involves a degree of subjectivity and requires that we make significant estimates of current credit risks and future trends all of which may undergo material changes changes in economic conditions affecting borrowers the stagnation of certain economic indicators that we are more susceptible to such as unemployment and real estate values new information regarding existing loans identification of additional problem loans and other factors both within and outside our control may require an increase in the alll in addition bank regulatory agencies periodically review our alll and may require an increase in the alll or the recognition of further loan chargeoffs based on judgments that can differ from those of our own management in addition if chargeoffs in future periods exceed the alll—that is if the alll is inadequate—we will need additional loan and lease loss provisions to increase the alll should such additional provisions become necessary they would result in a decrease in net income and capital and may have a material adverse effect on us 

the value of our goodwill may decline in the future 

as of december 31 2016 we had 69 billion of goodwill a significant decline in our expected future cash flows a significant adverse change in the business climate substantially slower economic growth or a significant and sustained decline in the price of our common stock any or all of which could be materially impacted by many of the risk factors discussed herein may

necessitate our taking charges in the future related to the impairment of our goodwill if we were to conclude that a future writedown of our goodwill is necessary we would record the appropriate charge which could be material to our operations for additional information regarding our goodwill impairment testing see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — critical accounting estimates” in part ii item 7 included in this report 

operational risks are inherent in our businesses 

our operations depend on our ability to process a very large number of transactions efficiently and accurately while complying with applicable laws and regulations operational risk and losses can result from internal and external fraud errors by employees or third parties failure to document transactions properly or to obtain proper authorization failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements and conduct of business rules equipment failures including those caused by natural disasters or by electrical telecommunications or other essential utility outages business continuity and data security system failures including those caused by computer viruses cyberattacks or unforeseen problems encountered while implementing major new computer systems or upgrades to existing systems or the inadequacy or failure of systems and controls including those of our suppliers or counterparties although we have implemented risk controls and loss mitigation actions and substantial resources are devoted to developing efficient procedures identifying and rectifying weaknesses in existing procedures and training staff it is not possible to be certain that such actions have been or will be effective in controlling each of the operational risks faced by us any weakness in these systems or controls or any breaches or alleged breaches of such laws or regulations could result in increased regulatory supervision enforcement actions and other disciplinary action and have an adverse impact on our business applicable authorizations and licenses reputation and results of operations 

the financial services industry including the banking sector is undergoing rapid technological changes as a result of competition and changes in the legal and regulatory framework and we may not be able to compete effectively as a result of these changes 

the financial services industry including the banking sector is continually undergoing rapid technological change with frequent introductions of new technologydriven products and services in addition new unexpected technological changes could have a disruptive effect on the way banks offer products and services we believe our success depends to a great extent on our ability to address customer needs by using technology to offer products and services that provide convenience to customers and to create additional efficiencies in our operations however we may not be able to among other things keep up with the rapid pace of technological changes effectively implement new technologydriven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to our customers as a result our ability to compete effectively to attract or retain new business may be impaired and our business financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected 

in addition changes in the legal and regulatory framework under which we operate require us to update our information systems to ensure compliance our need to review and evaluate the impact of ongoing rule proposals final rules and implementation guidance from regulators further complicates the development and implementation of new information systems for our business also recent regulatory guidance has focused on the need for financial institutions to perform increased due diligence and ongoing monitoring of thirdparty vendor relationships thus increasing the scope of management involvement and decreasing the efficiency otherwise resulting from our relationships with thirdparty technology providers given the significant number of ongoing regulatory reform initiatives it is possible that we incur higher than expected information technology costs in order to comply with current and impending regulations see “—supervisory requirements and expectations on us as a financial holding company and a bank holding company  our need to make improvements and devote resources to various aspects of our controls processes policies and procedures and any regulatorimposed limits on our activities could limit our ability to implement our strategic plan expand our business   improve our financial performance and make capital distributions to our stockholders” 

we are subject to a variety of cybersecurity risks that if realized could adversely affect how we conduct our business 

information security risks for large financial institutions such as cfg have increased significantly in recent years in part because of the proliferation of new technologies such as internet and mobile banking to conduct financial transactions and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime hackers terrorists nationstates activists and other external parties third parties with whom we or our customers do business also present operational and information security risks to us including security breaches or failures of their own systems our operations rely on the secure processing transmission and storage of confidential information in our computer systems and networks in addition to access our products and services our customers may use personal computers smartphones tablets and other mobile devices that are beyond our control environment although we believe that we have appropriate information security procedures and controls our technologies systems networks and our customers’ devices may be the target of cyberattacks or information security breaches that could result in the unauthorized release gathering monitoring misuse loss or destruction of our or our customers’ confidential proprietary and other information we are under continuous threat of loss due to cyberattacks especially as we continue to expand customer capabilities to utilize the internet and other remote channels to transact business two of the most significant cyberattack risks that we face are efraud and loss of sensitive customer data loss from efraud occurs when cybercriminals extract funds directly from customers’ or our accounts 

citizens financial group inc 

risk factors 

using fraudulent schemes that may include internetbased funds transfers we have been subject to a number of efraud incidents historically we have also been subject to attempts to steal sensitive customer data such as account numbers and social security numbers through unauthorized access to our computer systems including computer hacking such attacks are less frequent but could present significant reputational legal and regulatory costs to us if successful 

recently there has been a series of distributed denial of service attacks on financial services companies including us distributed denial of service attacks are designed to saturate the targeted online network with excessive amounts of network traffic resulting in slow response times or in some cases causing the site to be temporarily unavailable generally these attacks are conducted to interrupt or suspend a company’s access to internet service the attacks can adversely affect the performance of a company’s website and in some instances prevent customers from accessing a company’s website we have implemented certain technology protections such as customer profiling and stepup authentication to be in compliance with the ffiec authentication in internet banking environment “aibe” guidelines as cyber threats continue to evolve we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our layers of defense or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities the techniques used by cyber criminals change frequently may not be recognized until launched and can be initiated from a variety of sources including terrorist organizations and hostile foreign governments these actors may attempt to fraudulently induce employees customers or other users of our systems to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to data or our systems in the event that a cyberattack is successful our business financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected for a discussion of the guidance that federal banking regulators have released regarding cybersecurity and cyber risk management standards see “regulation and supervision” in part i item 1 — business included in this report 

we rely heavily on communications and information systems to conduct our business 

we rely heavily on communications and information systems to conduct our business any failure interruption or breach in security of these systems including due to hacking or other similar attempts to breach information technology security protocols could result in failures or disruptions in our customer relationship management general ledger deposit loan and other systems although we have established policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the effect of the possible failure interruption or security breach of our information systems there can be no assurance that these policies and procedures will be successful and that any such failure interruption or security breach will not occur or if they do occur that they will be adequately addressed the occurrence of any failure interruption or security breach of our information systems could damage our reputation result in a loss of customer business subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny or expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability 

we rely on third parties for the performance of a significant portion of our information technology 

we rely on third parties for the performance of a significant portion of our information technology functions and the provision of information technology and business process services for example i certain components and services relating to our online banking system rely on data communications networks operated by unaffiliated third parties ii many of our applications are hosted or maintained by third parties including our commercial loan system which is hosted and maintained by automated financial systems inc and iii our core deposits system is maintained by fidelity information services inc also in 2015 we entered into an agreement with ibm corporation for the provision of a wide range of information technology support services including end user data center network mainframe storage and database services the success of our business depends in part on the continuing ability of these and other third parties to perform these functions and services in a timely and satisfactory manner if we experience a disruption in the provision of any functions or services performed by third parties we may have difficulty in finding alternate providers on terms favorable to us and in reasonable timeframes if these services are not performed in a satisfactory manner we would not be able to serve our customers well in either situation our business could incur significant costs and be adversely affected 

we are exposed to reputational risk and the risk of damage to our brands and the brands of our affiliates 

our success and results depend in part on our reputation and the strength of our brands we are vulnerable to adverse market perception as we operate in an industry where integrity customer trust and confidence are paramount we are exposed to the risk that litigation employee misconduct operational failures the outcome of regulatory or other investigations or actions press speculation and negative publicity among other factors could damage our brands or reputation our brands and reputation could also be harmed if we sell products or services that do not perform as expected or customers’ expectations for the product are not satisfied 

we may be adversely affected by unpredictable catastrophic events or terrorist attacks and our business continuity and disaster recovery plans may not adequately protect us from serious disaster 

the occurrence of catastrophic events such as hurricanes tropical storms tornadoes and other largescale catastrophes and terrorist attacks could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations if a catastrophe rendered both our production data center in rhode island and our recovery data center in north carolina unusable although we enhanced our

risk factors 

disaster recovery capabilities in 2016 through the completion of the new outofregion backup data center in north carolina there can be no assurance that our current disaster recovery plans and capabilities will adequately protect us from serious disaster 

an inability to realize the value of our deferred tax assets could adversely affect operating results 

our net dtas are subject to an evaluation of whether it is more likely than not that they will be realized for financial statement purposes in making this determination we consider all positive and negative evidence available including the impact of recent operating results as well as potential carryback of tax to prior years’ taxable income reversals of existing taxable temporary differences tax planning strategies and projected earnings within the statutory tax loss carryover period we have determined that the dtas are more likely than not to be realized at december 31 2016 except for 107 million related to state net operating losses and state tax credits for which a valuation allowance was established if we were to conclude that a significant portion of the dtas were not more likely than not to be realized the required valuation allowance could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

we maintain a significant investment in projects that generate tax credits which we may not be able to fully utilize or if utilized may be subject to recapture or restructuring 

at december 31 2016 we maintained an investment of approximately 10 billion in entities for which we receive allocations of tax credits which we utilize to offset our taxable income we recognized 70 million in credits for the year ended december 31 2016 as of december 31 2016 all tax credits have been utilized to offset taxable income substantially all of these tax credits are related to development projects that are subject to ongoing compliance requirements over certain periods of time to fully realize their value if these projects are not operated in full compliance with the required terms the tax credits could be subject to recapture or restructuring further we may not be able to utilize any future tax credits if we are unable to utilize our tax credits or if our tax credits are subject to recapture or restructuring it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

risks related to our industry 

any deterioration in national economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our business is affected by national economic conditions as well as perceptions of those conditions and future economic prospects changes in such economic conditions are not predictable and cannot be controlled adverse economic conditions could require us to charge off a higher percentage of loans and increase the provision for credit losses which would reduce our net income and otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations for example our business was significantly affected by the global economic and financial crisis that began in 2008 the falling home prices increased rate of foreclosure and high levels of unemployment in the united states triggered significant writedowns by us and other financial institutions these writedowns adversely impacted our financial results in material respects although the us economy continues to recover an interruption or reversal of this recovery would adversely affect the financial services industry and banking sector 

we operate in an industry that is highly competitive which could result in losing business or margin declines and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we operate in a highly competitive industry the industry could become even more competitive as a result of reform of the financial services industry resulting from the doddfrank act and other legislative regulatory and technological changes as well as continued consolidation we face aggressive competition from other domestic and foreign lending institutions and from numerous other providers of financial services including nonbanking financial institutions that are not subject to the same regulatory restrictions as banks and bank holding companies securities firms and insurance companies and competitors that may have greater financial resources  

with respect to nonbanking financial institutions technology and other changes have lowered barriers to entry and made it possible for nonbanks to offer products and services traditionally provided by banks for example consumers can maintain funds that would have historically been held as bank deposits in brokerage accounts or mutual funds consumers can also complete transactions such as paying bills andor transferring funds directly without the assistance of banks the process of eliminating banks as intermediaries known as “disintermediation” could result in the loss of fee income as well as the loss of customer deposits and the related income generated from those deposits some of our nonbank competitors are not subject to the same extensive regulations we are and therefore may have greater flexibility in competing for business as a result of these and other sources of competition we could lose business to competitors or be forced to price products and services on less advantageous terms to retain or attract clients either of which would adversely affect our profitability and business

risk factors 

the conditions of other financial institutions or of the financial services industry could adversely affect our operations and financial conditions 

financial services institutions that deal with each other are interconnected as a result of trading investment liquidity management clearing counterparty and other relationships within the financial services industry the default by any one institution could lead to defaults by other institutions concerns about or a default by one institution could lead to significant liquidity problems and losses or defaults by other institutions as the commercial and financial soundness of many financial institutions are closely related as a result of these credit trading clearing and other relationships even the perceived lack of creditworthiness of or questions about a counterparty may lead to marketwide liquidity problems and losses or defaults by various institutions this systemic risk may adversely affect financial intermediaries such as clearing agencies banks and exchanges with which we interact on a daily basis or key funding providers such as the fhlbs any of which could have a material adverse effect on our access to liquidity or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

risks related to regulations governing our industry 

as a financial holding company and a bank holding company we are subject to comprehensive regulation that could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

as a financial holding company and a bank holding company we are subject to comprehensive regulation supervision and examination by the frb in addition cbna is subject to comprehensive regulation supervision and examination by the occ and cbpa is subject to comprehensive regulation supervision and examination by the fdic and the pa banking department our regulators supervise us through regular examinations and other means that allow the regulators to gauge management’s ability to identify assess and control risk in all areas of operations in a safe and sound manner and to ensure compliance with laws and regulations in the course of their supervision and examinations our regulators may require improvements in various areas if we are unable to implement and maintain any required actions in a timely and effective manner we could become subject to informal nonpublic or formal public supervisory actions and public enforcement orders that could lead to significant restrictions on our existing business or on our ability to engage in any new business such forms of supervisory action could include without limitation written agreements cease and desist orders and consent orders and may among other things result in restrictions on our ability to pay dividends requirements to increase capital restrictions on our activities the imposition of civil monetary penalties and enforcement of such actions through injunctions or restraining orders we could also be required to dispose of certain assets and liabilities within a prescribed period the terms of any such supervisory or enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are a bank holding company that has elected to become a financial holding company pursuant to the bank holding company act financial holding companies are allowed to engage in certain financial activities in which a bank holding company is not otherwise permitted to engage however to maintain financial holding company status a bank holding company and all of its depository institution subsidiaries must be “well capitalized” and “well managed” if a bank holding company ceases to meet these capital and management requirements there are many penalties it would be faced with including i the frb may impose limitations or conditions on the conduct of its activities and ii it may not undertake any of the broader financial activities permissible for financial holding companies or acquire a company engaged in such financial activities without prior approval of the frb if a company does not return to compliance within 180 days which period may be extended the frb may require divestiture of that company’s depository institutions to the extent we do not meet the requirements to be a financial holding company in the future there could be a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we may be unable to disclose some restrictions or limitations on our operations imposed by our regulators 

from time to time bank regulatory agencies take supervisory actions that restrict or limit a financial institution’s activities and lead it to raise capital or subject it to other requirements directives issued to enforce such actions may be confidential and thus in some instances we are not permitted to publicly disclose these actions in addition as part of our regular examination process our and our banking subsidiaries’ respective regulators may advise us or our banking subsidiaries to operate under various restrictions as a prudential matter any such actions or restrictions if and in whatever manner imposed could adversely affect our costs and revenues moreover efforts to comply with any such nonpublic supervisory actions or restrictions may require material investments in additional resources and systems as well as a significant commitment of managerial time and attention as a result such supervisory actions or restrictions if and in whatever manner imposed could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations and in certain instances we may not be able to publicly disclose these matters 

the regulatory environment in which we operate could have a material adverse effect on our business and earnings 

we are heavily regulated by bank and other regulatory agencies at the federal and state levels this regulatory oversight is established to protect depositors the fdic’s deposit insurance fund and the banking system as a whole not security holders changes to statutes regulations rules or policies including the interpretation or implementation of statutes regulations rules or policies could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways including subjecting us to additional costs limiting the types of

financial services and other products we may offer limiting our ability to pursue acquisitions and increasing the ability of third parties including nonbanks to offer competing financial services and products 

we are subject to capital adequacy and liquidity standards and if we fail to meet these standards our financial condition and operations would be adversely affected 

we are subject to several capital adequacy and liquidity standards to the extent that we are unable to meet these standards our ability to make distributions of capital will be limited and we may be subject to additional supervisory actions and limitations on our activities see “regulation and supervision” in part i item 1 — business and “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — capital” and “— liquidity” in part ii item 7 included in this report for further discussion of the regulations to which we are subject 

we could be required to act as a “source of strength” to our banking subsidiaries which would have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

frb policy historically required bank holding companies to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to their subsidiary banks the doddfrank act codified this policy as a statutory requirement this support may be required by the frb at times when we might otherwise determine not to provide it or when doing so is not otherwise in the interests of cfg or our stockholders or creditors and may include one or more of the following 

 we depend on our banking subsidiaries for most of our revenue and restrictions on dividends and other distributions by our banking subsidiaries could affect our liquidity and ability to fulfill our obligations 

as a bank holding company we are a separate and distinct legal entity from our banking subsidiaries cbna and cbpa we typically receive substantially all of our revenue from dividends from our banking subsidiaries these dividends are the principal source of funds to pay dividends on our equity and interest and principal on our debt various federal andor state laws and regulations as well as regulatory expectations limit the amount of dividends that our banking subsidiaries may pay to us also our right to participate in a distribution of assets upon a subsidiary’s liquidation or reorganization is subject to the prior claims of the subsidiary’s creditors in the event cbna or cpba is unable to pay dividends to us we may not be able to service debt pay obligations or pay dividends on our common stock the inability to receive dividends from cbna or cpba could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

we are and may be subject to regulatory actions that may have a material impact on our business 

we may become or are involved from time to time in reviews investigations and proceedings both formal and informal by governmental and selfregulatory agencies regarding our business these regulatory actions involve among other matters accounting consumer compliance and operational matters certain of which may result in adverse judgments settlements fines penalties injunctions or other relief that may require changes to our business or otherwise materially impact our business 

in regulatory actions such as those referred to above it is inherently difficult to determine whether any loss is probable or whether it is possible to reasonably estimate the amount of any loss we cannot predict with certainty if how or when such proceedings will be resolved or what the eventual fine penalty or other relief conditions or restrictions if any may be particularly for actions that are in their early stages of investigation we expect to make significant restitution payments to our banking subsidiaries’ customers arising from certain of the consumer compliance issues and also expect to pay civil money penalties in connection with certain of these issues adverse regulatory actions could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

risk factors 

we are and may be subject to litigation that may have a material impact on our business 

our operations are diverse and complex and we operate in legal and regulatory environments that expose us to potentially significant litigation risk in the normal course of business we have been named from time to time as a defendant in various legal actions including arbitrations class actions and other litigation arising in connection with our activities as a financial services institution including with respect to alleged unfair or deceptive business practices and misselling of certain products certain of the actual or threatened legal actions include claims for substantial compensatory andor punitive damages or claims for indeterminate amounts of damages in some cases the entities that would otherwise be the primary defendants in such cases are bankrupt or in financial distress moreover a number of recent judicial decisions have upheld the right of borrowers to sue lending institutions on the basis of various evolving legal theories collectively termed “lender liability” generally lender liability is founded on the premise that a lender has either violated a duty whether implied or contractual of good faith and fair dealing owed to the borrower or has assumed a degree of control over the borrower resulting in the creation of a fiduciary duty owed to the borrower or its other creditors or stockholders this could increase the amount of private litigation to which we are subject for more information regarding ongoing significant legal proceedings in which we are involved and certain identified past practices and policies for which we could face potential civil litigation see note 17 “commitments and contingencies” to our audited consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 — financial statements and supplementary data included in this report for further discussion 

the doddfrank act has changed and will likely continue to substantially change the legal and regulatory framework under which we operate our business 

congress and federal regulatory agencies continually review banking laws regulations and policies for possible changes the doddfrank act instituted major changes to the banking and financial institutions regulatory regimes the doddfrank act represents a significant overhaul of many aspects of the regulation of the financialservices industry addressing among other things i systemic risk ii capital adequacy iii consumer financial protection iv interchange fees v mortgage lending practices and vi regulation of derivatives and securities markets a significant number of the provisions of the doddfrank act still require extensive rulemaking and interpretation by regulatory authorities in several cases authorities have extended implementation periods and delayed effective dates accordingly in many respects the ultimate impact of the doddfrank act and its effects on the us financial system and on us will not be known for an extended period of time see “ regulation and supervision” in part i item 1 — business included in this report for further discussion of the regulations to which we are subject 

some of these and other major changes under the doddfrank act could materially impact the profitability of our business the value of assets we hold or the collateral available for coverage under our loans require changes to our business practices or force us to discontinue businesses and expose us to additional costs taxes liabilities enforcement actions and reputational risk 

the cfpb’s residential mortgage regulations could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

the cfpb finalized a number of significant rules that will impact nearly every aspect of the lifecycle of a residential mortgage these rules implement the doddfrank act amendments to the equal credit opportunity act the truth in lending act and the real estate settlement procedures act the final rules require banks to among other things i develop and implement procedures to ensure compliance with a new “ability to repay” standard and identify whether a loan meets a new definition for a “qualified mortgage” ii implement new or revised disclosures policies and procedures for servicing mortgages including but not limited to early intervention with delinquent borrowers and specific loss mitigation procedures for loans secured by a borrower’s principal residence iii comply with additional restrictions on mortgage loan originator hiring and compensation iv comply with new disclosure requirements and standards for appraisals and certain financial products and v maintain escrow accounts for “higher priced mortgage loans” for a longer period of time these new rules create operational and strategic challenges for us as we are both a mortgage originator and a servicer for example business models for cost pricing delivery compensation and risk management will need to be reevaluated and potentially revised perhaps substantially additionally programming changes and enhancements to systems will be necessary to comply with the new rules we also expect additional rulemaking affecting our residential mortgage business to be forthcoming these rules and any other new regulatory requirements promulgated by the cfpb and state regulatory authorities could require changes to our business in addition to the changes we have been required to make thus far such changes would result in increased compliance costs and potential changes to our product offerings which would have an adverse effect on the revenue derived from such business 

the doddfrank act’s consumer protection regulations could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

the frb enacted consumer protection regulations related to automated overdraft payment programs offered by financial institutions prior to the enactment of these regulations our overdraft and insufficient funds fees represented a significant amount of noninterest fees since taking effect on july 1 2010 the fees received by us for automated overdraft payment services have

risk factors 

decreased thereby adversely impacting our noninterest income complying with these regulations has resulted in increased operational costs for us which may continue to rise the actual impact of these regulations in future periods could vary due to a variety of factors including changes in customer behavior economic conditions and other factors which could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations the cfpb has since then published additional studies of overdraft practices and has announced that it is considering enacting further regulations regarding overdrafts and related services 

the consumer protection provisions of the doddfrank act and the examination supervision and enforcement of those laws and implementing regulations by the cfpb have created a more intense and complex environment for consumer finance regulation the cfpb is authorized to engage in consumer financial education track consumer complaints request data and promote the availability of financial services to underserved consumers and communities we expect increased oversight of financial services products by the cfpb which is likely to affect our operations the cfpb has significant authority to implement and enforce federal consumer finance laws including the truth in lending act the equal credit opportunity act the fair credit billing act and new requirements for financial services products provided for in the doddfrank act as well as the authority to identify and prohibit unfair deceptive or abusive acts and practices “udaap” the review of products and practices to prevent udaap is a continuing focus of the cfpb and of banking regulators more broadly the ultimate impact of this heightened scrutiny is uncertain but could result in changes to pricing practices products and procedures it could also result in increased costs related to regulatory oversight supervision and examination additional remediation efforts and possible penalties 

in addition the doddfrank act provides the cfpb with broad supervisory examination and enforcement authority over various consumer financial products and services including the ability to require reimbursements and other payments to customers for alleged legal violations and to impose significant penalties as well as injunctive relief that prohibits lenders from engaging in allegedly unlawful practices the cfpb also has the authority to obtain cease and desist orders providing for affirmative relief andor monetary penalties the doddfrank act and accompanying regulations including regulations to be promulgated by the cfpb are being phased in over time and while some regulations have been promulgated many others have not yet been proposed or finalized for example the cfpb has announced that it is considering new rules regarding debt collection practices and has proposed new regulations of prepaid accounts and proposed amendments to its regulations implementing the home mortgage disclosure act we cannot predict the terms of all of the final regulations their intended consequences or how such regulations will affect us or our industry 

the doddfrank act does not prevent states from adopting stricter consumer protection standards state regulation of financial products and potential enforcement actions could also adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

compliance with antimoney laundering and antiterrorism financing rules involve significant cost and effort 

we are subject to rules and regulations regarding money laundering and the financing of terrorism monitoring compliance with antimoney laundering and antiterrorism financing rules can put a significant financial burden on banks and other financial institutions and poses significant technical challenges although we believe our current policies and procedures are sufficient to comply with applicable rules and regulations we cannot guarantee that our antimoney laundering and antiterrorism financing policies and procedures completely prevent situations of money laundering or terrorism financing any such failure events may have severe consequences including sanctions fines and reputational consequences which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

we may become subject to more stringent regulatory requirements and activity restrictions or have to restructure if the frb and fdic determine that our resolution plan is not credible 

frb and fdic regulations require bank holding companies with more than 50 billion in assets to submit resolution plans that in the event of material financial distress or failure establish the rapid orderly and systemically safe liquidation of the company under the us bankruptcy code separately insured depository institutions with more than 50 billion in assets must submit to the fdic a resolution plan whereby they can be resolved in a manner that is orderly and that ensures that depositors will receive access to insured funds within certain required timeframes if the frb and the fdic jointly determine that the resolution plan of a bank holding company is not credible and the company fails to cure the deficiencies in a timely manner then the frb and the fdic may jointly impose on the company or on any of its subsidiaries more stringent capital leverage or liquidity requirements or restrictions on growth activities or operations or require the divestment of certain assets or operations if the frb and the fdic determine that our resolution plan is not credible or would not facilitate our orderly resolution under the us bankruptcy code we could become subject to more stringent regulatory requirements or business restrictions or have to divest certain of our assets or businesses any such measures could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations

risk factors 

risks related to our common stock 

our stock price may be volatile and you could lose all or part of your investment as a result 

you should consider an investment in our common stock to be risky and you should invest in our common stock only if you can withstand a significant loss and wide fluctuation in the market value of your investment the market price of our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to among other things the factors described in this “risk factors” section and other factors some of which are beyond our control these factors include 

 furthermore the stock markets have experienced price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market price of equity securities of many companies these fluctuations have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies 

these broad market fluctuations as well as general economic systemic political and market conditions such as recessions loss of investor confidence interest rate changes or international currency fluctuations may negatively affect the market price of our common stock 

if any of the foregoing occurs it could cause our stock price to fall and may expose us to securities class action litigation that even if unsuccessful could be costly to defend and a distraction to management 

we may not pay cash dividends on our common stock 

holders of our common stock are only entitled to receive such dividends as our board of directors may declare out of funds legally available for such payments although we have historically declared cash dividends on our common stock we are not required to do so and may reduce or eliminate our common stock dividend in the future this could adversely affect the market price of our common stock also as a bank holding company our ability to declare and pay dividends is dependent on certain federal regulatory considerations including the rules of the frb regarding capital adequacy and dividends additionally we are required to submit annual capital plans to the frb for review before we can take certain capital actions including declaring and paying dividends and repurchasing or redeeming capital securities if our capital plan or any amendment to our capital plan is objected to for any reason our ability to declare and pay dividends on our capital stock may be limited further if we are unable to satisfy the capital requirements applicable to us for any reason we may be limited in our ability to declare and pay dividends on our capital stock see “regulation and supervision” in part i item 1 — business included in this report for further discussion of the regulations to which we are subject 

“antitakeover” provisions and the regulations to which we are subject may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us even if the change in control would be beneficial to stockholders 

we are a bank holding company incorporated in the state of delaware antitakeover provisions in delaware law and our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws as well as regulatory approvals that would be required under federal law could make it more difficult for a third party to take control of us and may prevent stockholders from receiving a premium for their shares of our common stock these provisions could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and could reduce the amount that stockholders might get if we are sold 

we believe these provisions protect our stockholders from coercive or otherwise unfair takeover tactics by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with our board and by providing our board with more time to assess any acquisition proposal however these provisions apply even if the offer may be determined to be beneficial by some stockholders and could delay or prevent an acquisition that our board determines is not in our best interest and that of our stockholders

overview

key factors affecting our business 

macroeconomic conditions 

our business is affected by national and regional economic conditions as well as the perception of future conditions and economic prospects the significant macroeconomic factors that impact our business include the rate of economic expansion the health of the housing market unemployment levels and interest rates 

citizens financial group inc 

management’s discussion and analysis 

the us economy continued to expand at a moderate pace with annual real gdp rising by 16  in 2016 compared with an increase of 26 in 2015 the housing sector remained steady as compared to previous quarters with three month average existing home sales of 56 million units 

the labor market continued to improve with moderate job gains and lower levels of unemployment the us unemployment rate declined to 47 at december 31 2016 from 50 at december 31 2015 average monthly nonfarm employment increased by 180000 in 2016 compared to a revised increase of 229000 in 2015 

the frb maintained very accommodative monetary policy conditions during 2016 notwithstanding the 025 rate increase in december and continues to target a 050 to 075 federal funds rate range at the short end of the yield curve interest rates have risen but still remain relatively low on an historical basis see “—interest rates” below for further discussion of the impact of interest rates on our results observable inflation levels have risen closer to the frb’s longerterm objective of 20 further labor market improvement and the dissipation of the effects of a decline in energy and import prices are expected to bring inflation closer to the frb’s inflation objective 

interest rates 

net interest income is our largest source of revenue and is the difference between the interest earned on interestearning assets usually loans and investment securities and the interest expense incurred in connection with interestbearing liabilities usually deposits and borrowings the level of net interest income is primarily a function of the average balance of interestearning assets the average balance of interestbearing liabilities and the spread between the effective yield on such assets and the effective cost of such liabilities these factors are influenced by the pricing and mix of interestearning assets and interestbearing liabilities which in turn are impacted by external factors such as local economic conditions competition for loans and deposits monetary policy of the frb and market interest rates for further discussion refer to “—risk governance” and “—market risk — nontrading risk” included in this report 

the cost of our deposits and shortterm wholesale borrowings is largely based on shortterm interest rates which are primarily driven by the frb’s actions however the yields generated by our loans and securities are typically driven by both shortterm and longterm interest rates which are set by the market or at times by the frb’s actions the level of net interest income is therefore influenced by movements in such interest rates and the pace at which such movements occur in the fourth quarter of 2016 shortterm and longterm interest rates increased including benchmark rates such as the federal funds rate and oneand threemonth libor due to the frb’s decision to raise rates in december and to changes in growth and inflation expectations longerterm yields rose more than shortterm yields a steeper yield curve which would have a beneficial impact on our margin and net interest income given our asset sensitive position 

in 2016 and 2015 the frb maintained a highly accommodative monetary policy and indicated that this policy would remain in effect for a considerable time after its asset purchase program ended on october 29 2014 and the economic recovery strengthens in the united states more recently the frb has started to move down the path of interest rate normalization by raising the federal funds rate by 25 basis points in december 2016 however the frb will likely continue to target an accommodative monetary policy for some time to come with interest rates expected to gradually increase to more normal levels 

regulatory trends 

we are subject to extensive regulation and supervision which continue to evolve as the legal and regulatory framework governing our operations continues to change the current operating environment reflects heightened regulatory expectations around many regulations including consumer compliance the bank secrecy act antimoney laundering compliance and increased internal audit activities 

doddfrank regulation 

as described under “regulation and supervision” in part i item 1 — business included in this report we are subject to a variety of laws and regulations including the doddfrank act the doddfrank act is complex and many aspects of the doddfrank act are subject to final rulemaking or phased implementation that will take effect over several years the doddfrank act may continue to impact our earnings through fee reductions higher costs and imposition of new restrictions on us the doddfrank act may also continue to have a material adverse impact on the value of certain assets and liabilities held on our balance sheet the ultimate impact of the doddfrank act on our business will depend on regulatory interpretation and rulemaking as well as the success of any of our actions to mitigate the negative impacts of certain provisions one part of the doddfrank act that specifically impacts our business is the frbg’s capital planning and stresstesting framework known as ccar and dfast which continues to evolve under this supervisory framework we are required to submit annual capital plans to the frb and are subject to annual supervisory and semiannual internal stress tests requirements 

consistent with these requirements we must submit our annual capital plan and the results of our annual companyrun stress tests to the frb by april 5 th  of each year and disclose certain results within 15 days of the date the frb discloses the results 

citizens financial group inc 

management’s discussion and analysis 

of its supervisoryrun tests we submitted our 2016 capital plan and related annual stress test results to the frb on april 5 2016 we published our estimated results under the supervisory severely adverse scenario on the investor relations regulatory filings and disclosures page of our corporate website on june 23 2016 the annual dfast process projects net income loan losses and capital ratios during a ninequarter horizon under hypothetical stressful macroeconomic and financial market scenarios developed by the frbg as well as certain mandated assumptions about capital distributions prescribed in the dfast rule consistent with the purpose of these exercises and the assumptions used to assess our performance during hypothetical economic conditions the projected results under the required stress scenarios show severe negative impacts on earnings and decline in capital ratios however these pro forma results should not be interpreted as management expectations but rather as a possible result under hypothetical severely adverse economic conditions that do not take into account capital conservation actions that would be mandated by internal policy if such conditions were actually to occur 

similarly we are required to submit the results of our midcycle companyrun dfast stress tests by october 5 th  of each year and disclose the results under an internally developed severely adverse scenario between october 5 th  and november 4 th  we submitted the results of our 2016 midcycle stress test to the frb on october 3 2016 and disclosed a summary of the results on october 5 2016 we publish estimated impacts of stress as required by applicable regulation processes which may be accessed on our regulatory filings and disclosures page on httpinvestorcitizensbankcom 

the doddfrank act also requires each of our bank subsidiaries to conduct stress tests on an annual basis and to disclose the stress test results cbna submitted its 2016 annual stress tests to the occ on april 5 2016 and published a summary of the results along with the stress test result of the bank holding company parent on june 23 2016 cbpa submitted its 2016 annual stress tests to the fdic on april 5 2016 and published its summary results as an update to the parent companycbna doddfrank act companyrun stress test disclosure on our investor relations site on october 17 2016 prior to the october 31 2016 deadline that the fdic sets for banks with 10 to 50 billion in total assets 

comprehensive capital analysis and review 

ccar is an annual exercise by the frbg to ensure that the largest bank holding companies have sufficient capital to continue operations throughout times of economic and financial stress and robust forwardlooking capital planning processes that account for their unique risks 

as part of ccar the frbg evaluates institutions’ capital adequacy for noncomplex institutions internal capital adequacy assessment processes and their plans to make capital distributions such as dividend payments or stock repurchases the frbg may either object to our capital plan in whole or in part or provide a notice of nonobjection if the frbg objects to our capital plan we may not make any capital distribution other than those with respect to which the frbg has indicated its nonobjection 

credit trends 

overall credit quality continued to improve reflecting growth in lower risk retail loans and modest increases in commercial categories nonperforming loans and leases of 10 billion  as of december 31 2016  decreased 15 million from december 31 2015 reflecting improvements in retail real estate secured categories offset by an increase in commercial nonperforming assets largely driven by commoditiesrelated businesses net chargeoffs of 335 million   increased   51 million  or 18  from 284 million  in 2015 as a 59 million increase in commercial largely tied to commoditiesrelated businesses and a reduction in commercial real estate recoveries more than offset an 8 million decrease in retail net chargeoffs of 032  of average total loans and leases remained relatively stable with 030  in 2015 

heloc payment shock 

attention has been given by regulators rating agencies and the general press regarding the potential for increased exposure to credit losses associated with helocs that were originated during the period of rapid home price appreciation between 2003 and 2007 industry wide many of the helocs originated during this timeframe were structured with an extended interestonly payment period followed by a requirement to convert to a higher payment amount that would begin fully amortizing both principal and interest beginning at a certain date in the future to help manage this exposure in september 2013 we launched a comprehensive program designed to provide heightened customer outreach to inform educate and assist customers through the reset process as well as to offer alternative financing and forbearance options results of this program indicate that our efforts to assist customers at risk of default have successfully reduced delinquency and chargeoff rates compared to our original expectations as of december 31 2016  approximately 18  of our 143 billion  heloc portfolio or 26 billion  in drawn balances were subject to a payment reset or balloon payment between january 1 2017 and december 31 2018 

as of december 31 2016  for the 17 billion  of our heloc portfolio that reached the end of the interestonly draw period and entered repayment of principal and interest in 2014 and 2015 94  of the balances have been refinanced paid off or were current on payments 3  are past due and 3  have been charged off as of december 31 2016  for the 738 million  of our heloc portfolio that reached the end of the interestonly draw period and entered repayment of principal and interest in 2016 95  of the balances have been refinanced paid off or were current on payments 4  are past due and 1  have been charged off

a total of 11 billion  of heloc balances are scheduled to reach the end of the interestonly draw period and enter repayment of principal and interest in 2017 for the 53 billion heloc portfolio scheduled to reach the end of the interestonly draw period and enter repayment of principal and interest between december 31 2016 and december 31 2021 44 was secured by a first lien with a the weighted average fico score of the borrowers of 764 and a loantovalue ratio of 613 those results compare to the total heloc portfolio of 143 billion that was 50 secured by a first lien with a weighted average fico score of the borrowers of 767 and a loantovalue ratio of 613 factors that affect our future expectations for continued relatively low chargeoff risk in the face of rising interest rates for the portion of our heloc portfolio subject to reset in future periods include a relatively high level of first lien collateral positions improved loantovalue ratios resulting from continued home price appreciation relatively stable portfolio credit score profiles and continued robust loss mitigation efforts 

principal components of operations and key performance metrics used by management 

as a banking institution we manage and evaluate various aspects of our results of operations and our financial condition we evaluate the levels and trends of the line items included in our balance sheet and statement of operations as well as various financial ratios that are commonly used in our industry we analyze these ratios and financial trends against our own historical performance our budgeted performance and the financial condition and performance of comparable banking institutions in our region and nationally 

the primary line items we use in our key performance metrics to manage and evaluate our statement of operations include net interest income noninterest income total revenue provision for credit losses noninterest expense net income and net income available to common stockholders the primary line items we use in our key performance metrics to manage and evaluate our balance sheet data include loans and leases securities allowance for credit losses deposits borrowed funds and derivatives 

net interest income 

net interest income is the difference between the interest earned on interestearning assets usually loans and investment securities and the interest expense incurred in connection with interestbearing liabilities usually deposits and borrowings the level of net interest income is primarily a function of the average balance of interestearning assets the average balance of interestbearing liabilities and the spread between the effective yield on such assets and the effective cost of such liabilities net interest income is impacted by the relative mix of interestearning assets and interestbearing liabilities movements in market interest rates levels of nonperforming assets and pricing pressure from competitors the mix of interestearning assets is influenced by loan demand and by management’s continual assessment of the rate of return and relative risk associated with various classes of interestearning assets 

the mix of interestbearing liabilities is influenced by management’s assessment of the need for lower cost funding sources weighed against relationships with customers and growth requirements and is impacted by competition for deposits in our market and the availability and pricing of other sources of funds 

noninterest income 

the primary components of our noninterest income are service charges and fees card fees trust and investment services fees and mortgage banking fees 

total revenue 

total revenue is the sum of our net interest income and our noninterest income 

provision for credit losses 

the provision for credit losses is the amount of expense that based on our judgment is required to maintain the allowance for credit losses at an amount that reflects probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date and that in management’s judgment is appropriate under relevant accounting guidance the provision for credit losses includes the provision for loan and lease losses as well as the provision for unfunded commitments the determination of the amount of the allowance for credit losses is complex and involves a high degree of judgment and subjectivity for additional information regarding the provision for credit losses see “—critical accounting estimates — allowance for credit losses” note 1 “significant accounting policies” and note 5 “allowance for credit losses nonperforming assets and concentrations of credit risk” to our audited consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 — financial statements and supplementary data included in this report 

noninterest expense 

noninterest expense includes salaries and employee benefits outside services occupancy expense equipment expense amortization of software and other operating expenses 

net income and net income available to common stockholders 

we evaluate our net income and net income available to common stockholders based on measures including return on average common equity return on average total assets and return on average tangible common equity

loans and leases 

we classify our loans and leases pursuant to the following classes commercial commercial real estate leases residential mortgages home equity loans home equity lines of credit home equity loans serviced by others home equity lines of credit serviced by others automobile student credit cards and other retail our sbo portfolio consists of purchased home equity loans and lines that were originally serviced by others which we now service a portion of internally 

loans are reported at the amount of their outstanding principal net of chargeoffs unearned income deferred loan origination fees and costs and unamortized premiums or discounts on purchased loans deferred loan origination fees and costs and purchase discounts and premiums are amortized as an adjustment of yield over the life of the loan using the effective interest method unamortized amounts remaining upon prepayment or sale are recorded as interest income or gain loss on sale respectively credit card receivables include billed and uncollected interest and fees 

leases are classified at the inception of the lease by type lease receivables including leveraged leases are reported at the aggregate of lease payments receivable and estimated residual values net of unearned and deferred income including unamortized investment credits lease residual values are reviewed at least annually for otherthantemporary impairment with valuation adjustments for direct financing and leveraged leases recognized currently against other income leveraged leases are reported net of nonrecourse debt unearned income is recognized to yield a level rate of return on the net investment in the leases 

loans held for sale at fair value 

mortgage loans and commercial loans held for sale are carried at fair value 

other loans held for sale 

balances represent loans that were transferred to other loans held for sale are reported at the lower of cost or fair value 

securities 

our securities portfolio is managed to seek return while maintaining prudent levels of quality market risk and liquidity investments in debt and equity securities are carried in four portfolios afs htm trading securities and other investment securities we determine the appropriate classification at the time of purchase securities in our afs portfolio will be held for indefinite periods of time and may be sold in response to changes in interest rates changes in prepayment risk or other factors relevant to our asset and liability strategy securities in our afs portfolio are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported in oci as a separate component of stockholders’ equity net of taxes securities are classified as htm because we have the ability and intent to hold the securities to maturity and securities in our htm portfolio are carried at amortized cost other investment securities are composed mainly of fhlb stock and frb stock which are carried at cost and money market mutual fund investments held by our brokerdealer which are carried at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in other income 

allowance for credit losses 

our estimate of probable losses in the loan and lease portfolios is recorded in the alll and the reserve for unfunded lending commitments together these are referred to as the allowance for credit losses we evaluate the allowance for credit losses using the following ratios alll as a percentage of total loans and leases alll as a percentage of nonperforming loans and leases and nonperforming loans and leases as a percentage of total loans and leases for additional information see “—critical accounting estimates — allowance for credit losses” and note 1 “significant accounting policies” and note 5 “allowance for credit losses nonperforming assets and concentrations of credit risk” to our audited consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 — financial statements and supplementary data included in this report 

deposits 

our deposits include on demand checking checking with interest regular savings accounts money market accounts and term deposits 

borrowed funds 

as of december 31 2016 our total shortterm borrowed funds included federal funds purchased securities sold under agreement to repurchase the current portion of fhlb advances longterm debt that matures within one year and other shortterm borrowed funds as of december 31 2016 our longterm borrowed funds included subordinated debt unsecured notes federal home loan advances and other longterm borrowed funds for additional information see “—analysis of financial condition — borrowed funds” and note 12 “borrowed funds” to our audited consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 — financial statements and supplementary data included in this report

derivatives 

we use payfixed swaps to lengthen liabilities synthetically and offset duration in fixedrate assets we also use payfixed swaps to hedge floatingrate wholesale funding 

we use receivefixed interest rate swaps to manage the interest rate exposure on our medium term borrowings we also use receivefixed swaps to minimize the exposure to variability in the interest cash flows on our floating rate assets the carrying amount of assets and liabilities recorded for derivatives designated as hedges reflect the market value of these hedge instruments 

we sell interest rate swaps and foreign exchange forwards to commercial customers offsetting swap and forward agreements are generally transacted to minimize our market risk associated with the customer derivative contracts the carrying amount of assets and liabilities recorded for derivatives not designated as hedges reflect the market value of these transactions for additional information see “—analysis of financial condition — derivatives” and note 16 “derivatives” to our audited consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 — financial statements and supplementary data included in this report 

key performance metrics and nongaap financial measures 

we consider various measures when evaluating our performance and making daytoday operating decisions as well as evaluating capital utilization and adequacy including 

   

we present and provide reconciliations of our nongaap measures these reconciliations are adjusted for restructuring charges special items andor notable items which are included where applicable in the financial results presented in accordance with gaap restructuring charges and special items include revenues and expenses related to our efforts to improve processes and enhance efficiencies as well as rebranding separation from rbs and regulatory expenses notable items include certain revenue or expense items that may occur in a reporting period which management does not consider indicative of ongoing financial performance 

we believe these nongaap measures provide useful information to investors because these are among the measures used by our management team to evaluate our operating performance and make daytoday operating decisions in addition we believe restructuring charges special items andor notable items in any period do not reflect the operational performance of the business in that period and accordingly it is useful to consider these line items with and without restructuring charges special items andor notable items we believe this presentation also increases comparability of periodtoperiod results 

other companies may use similarly titled nongaap financial measures that are calculated differently from the way we calculate such measures accordingly our nongaap financial measures may not be comparable to similar measures used by other companies we caution investors not to place undue reliance on such nongaap measures but instead to consider them with the most directly comparable gaap measure nongaap financial measures have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for our results reported under gaap 

nongaap measures are denoted throughout “—results of operations” by the use of the term “adjusted” and are followed by an asterisk

net interest income of 38 billion  in 2016 increased 356 million  or 10  compared to 34 billion  in 2015 reflecting 8  average loan growth and the benefit of balance sheet optimization strategies and higher rates 

average interestearning assets of 1305 billion  increased 76 billion  or 6  from 2015 driven by a 44 billion  increase in average commercial loans a 28 billion  increase in average retail loans and a 185 million  increase in average interestbearing cash and due from banks and deposits in banks commercial loan growth was driven by strength in commercial and commercial real estate retail loan growth was driven by strength in student residential mortgage automobile and other retail loan balances

net interest margin of 286  increased 11  basis points compared to 275  in 2015 driven by the benefit of pricing and portfolio optimization initiatives on loan portfolio mix and yield partially offset by a modest increase in deposit and funding costs and a reduction in investment portfolio yields results also reflected the benefit of lower payfixed swap expense

1  includes net securities impairment losses on securities available for sale recognized in earnings and other income 

noninterest income of 15 billion  in 2016 increased   75 million  or 5  compared to 2015 largely driven by a 67 million pretax benefit from notable items in other income excluding the impact of these items adjusted noninterest income increased 8 million or 1 as strength in capital markets fees service charges and fees and mortgage fees were partially offset by the impact of a reclassification of card reward costs lower securities gains and trust and investment services fees capital market fees increased   37 million  reflecting underlying business momentum and the benefit of enhanced product capabilities service charges increased   24 million  driven by both improved pricing and volume mortgage banking fees increased   11 million  from 2015 levels that included higher msr valuation gains driven by increased secondary origination volume and wider margins card fees decreased   29 million  from 2015 results which were 28 million higher given the reclassification of card reward costs 

provision for credit losses 

provision for credit losses of 369 million   increased   67 million  or 22  from 302 million  in 2015 largely reflecting the impact of higher commercial net chargeoffs primarily in commoditiesrelated portfolios and commercial real estate driven by the impact of a reduction in recoveries as well as the impact of loan growth 2016 results reflected a 34 million reserve build compared to an 18 million reserve build in 2015 as the impact of loan growth was partially offset by loan mix shifts into higher quality retail products

noninterest expense 

the following table presents the significant components of our noninterest expense 



  

noninterest expense of 34 billion  in 2016 increased   93 million  or 3  compared to 2015 as the impact of higher salaries and employee benefits amortization of software equipment expense and outside services expense was partially offset by lower occupancy and other operating expense results in 2016 reflected the impact of 36 million of notable items compared with 50 million of restructuring charges and special items in 2015 excluding the impact of restructuring charges special items and 

citizens financial group inc 

management’s discussion and analysis 

notable items adjusted noninterest expense increased 107 million driven by higher salaries and employee benefits as the impact of continued investment in strategic growth initiatives and revenue based incentives were partially offset by the benefit of our efficiency initiatives results also reflect increased software amortization expense outside services expense and equipment expense partially offset by lower other operating expense 

income tax expense 

income tax expense was 489 million  and 423 million  in 2016 and 2015 respectively this resulted in an effective tax rate of 319  and 335  in 2016 and 2015 respectively the decrease in the effective income tax rate from 2015 to 2016 was primarily attributable to the impact of federal and state tax credits 

at december 31 2016 we reported a net deferred tax liability of 714 million  compared to a 730 million  liability at december 31 2015 the decrease in the net deferred tax liability was primarily attributable to the tax effect of net unrealized losses on securities and derivatives arising during the period largely offset by the tax effect of current year timing adjustments for further discussion see note 15 “income taxes” to our consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 — financial statements and supplementary data included in this report

net interest income of 34 billion in 2015 increased 101 million or 3 compared to 33 billion in 2014 as the benefit of earning asset growth and a reduction in payfixed swap costs was partially offset by continued pressure from the relatively persistent lowrate environment on loan yields and mix higher borrowing costs related to debt issuances and higher deposit costs 

average interestearning assets increased 68 billion or 6 from 2014 due to a 39 billion increase in average commercial loans and leases and a 32 billion increase in average retail loans as growth in auto mortgage and student loan balances were partially offset by lower home equity outstandings and a reduction in the noncore loan portfolio 

 2015 net interest margin of 275 declined eight basis points compared to 283 in 2014 as the benefit of lower payfixed swap costs was more than offset by increased deposit costs higher senior and subordinated debt borrowing costs and a modest decrease in loan yields 2015 average interestearning asset yields of 312 declined two basis points from 314 in 2014 reflecting the decline in the commercial loan and lease portfolio yields given the continued impact of the relatively persistent lowrate environment investment portfolio income of 621 million in 2015 remained relatively stable compared to 619 million in 2014 

  total interestbearing deposit costs of 237 million in 2015 increased 81 million or 52 from 156 million in 2014 and reflected a nine basis point increase in the rate paid on deposits to 033 from 024 the increase in deposit costs reflected a shift in mix to longer duration deposits largely term and money market products the cost of term deposits increased to 082   in 2015 from 065 in 2014 and money market accounts and savings accounts increased to 027 in 2015 from 019 in 2014

noninterest expense 

the following table displays the significant components of our noninterest expense 



  

noninterest expense of 33 billion in 2015 declined 133 million or 4 compared to 34 billion 2014 driven by a 119 million decrease in restructuring charges and special items excluding the impact of the restructuring charges and special items adjusted noninterest expense decreased 14 million driven by lower occupancy expense salaries and employee benefits and other operating expense partially offset by higher equipment amortization of software and outside services results reflected the impact of the chicago divestiture and investments to drive future growth offset by the benefit of efficiency initiatives

income tax expense 

income tax expense of 423 million increased from 403 million in 2014 respectively and reflected an effective tax rate of 335 which increased from 318 in 2014 the increase in the effective income tax rate related to the taxrate impact of combined reporting legislation nondeductible permanent expense items and the adoption of asu no 201401 “accounting for investments in qualified affordable housing projects” the application of this guidance resulted in the reclassification of the amortization of these investments to income tax expense from noninterest income furthermore these increases were partially offset by the tax rate impact of the gain on the chicago divestiture in the second quarter of 2014 

at december 31 2015 we reported a net deferred tax liability of 730 million compared to a 493 million liability at december 31 2014 the increase in the net deferred tax liability was primarily attributable to the increase in the deferred tax liability related to temporary differences of 261 million for further discussion see note 15 “income taxes” to our consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 — financial statements and supplementary data included in this report

our capital levels are evaluated and managed centrally however capital is allocated to the operating segments to support evaluation of business performance operating segments are allocated capital on a riskadjusted basis considering economic and regulatory capital requirements we approximate that regulatory capital is equivalent to a sustainable target level for common equity tier 1 and then allocate that approximation to the segments based on economic capital interest income and expense is determined based on the assets and liabilities managed by the business segment because funding and asset liability management is a central function funds transferpricing methodologies are utilized to allocate a cost of funds used or credit for the funds provided to all business segment assets liabilities and capital respectively using a matchedfunding concept the residual effect on net interest income of assetliability management including the residual net interest income related to the funds transfer pricing process is included in other 

provision for credit losses is allocated to each business segment based on actual net chargeoffs that have been recognized by the business segment the difference between the consolidated provision for credit losses and the business segments’ net chargeoffs is reflected in other 

noninterest income and expense directly managed by each business segment including fees service charges salaries and benefits and other direct revenues and costs are accounted for within each segment’s financial results in a manner similar to our consolidated financial statements occupancy costs are allocated based on utilization of facilities by the business segment noninterest expenses incurred by centrally managed operations or business segments that directly support another business segment’s operations are charged to the applicable business segment based on its utilization of those services 

income taxes are assessed to each business segment at a standard tax rate with the residual tax expense or benefit to arrive at the consolidated effective tax rate included in other

consumer banking net income of 262 million in 2015 increased 80 million or 44 from 2014 reflecting higher revenue and lower expense 

consumer banking total revenue of 31 billion in 2015 increased 58 million from 2014 despite the impact of the chicago divestiture driven by loan and deposit growth as well as growth in overall fee revenue tied to mortgage banking and service charges net 

net interest income of 22 billion increased 2 from 2014 driven by the benefit of loan growth with particular strength in auto residential mortgage and student loans of 910 million partially offset by the effect of the relatively persistent lowrate environment as well as the impact of the chicago divestiture noninterest income increased 1 driven by strength in mortgage banking and higher service charges partially offset by the chicago divestiture 

noninterest expense of 25 billion in 2015 decreased 57 million or 2 from 25 billion in 2014 reflecting a combination of the chicago divestiture and cost saving actions offset by the continued investment in the business to drive future growth 

provision for credit losses of 252 million in 2015 decreased 7 million or 3 from 259 million in 2014 reflecting continued improvement in credit quality partially offset by the continued growth in loan balances

noninterest expense of 709 million in 2015 increased 57 million or 9 from 652 million in 2014 reflecting increased salary and benefits costs outside services and insurance expense including continued investments to drive future growth 

provision for credit losses resulted in a net recovery of 13 million in 2015 compared to a net recovery of 6 million in 2014 and reflected continued improvement in credit quality

net interest income in 2015 decreased 35 million to 42 million compared to 77 million in 2014 the decrease was driven primarily by an increase in wholesale funding costs and lower noncore loans partially offset by a reduction in interest rate swap costs 

noninterest income in 2015 decreased 253 million driven by the 288 million pretax gain on the chicago divestiture excluding the gain adjusted noninterest income increased 35 million driven by an accounting change for lowincome housing investments which is offset in income tax expense 

noninterest expense in 2015 of 94 million decreased 133 million from 2014 reflecting lower restructuring charges and special items of 119 million and lower employee incentive costs 

the provision for credit losses in 2015 decreased 3 million to 63 million compared to 66 million in 2014 reflecting stable credit quality and a decrease in noncore net chargeoffs of 23 million to 44 million in 2015 compared to 67 million in 2014 on a quarterly basis we review and refine our estimate of the allowance for credit losses taking into consideration changes in portfolio size and composition historical loss experience internal risk ratings current economic conditions industryperformance trends and other pertinent information the provision also reflected an increase in overall credit exposure associated with growth in our loan portfolio

securities 

our securities portfolio is managed to maintain prudent levels of liquidity credit quality and market risk while achieving appropriate returns the following table presents our securities afs and htm 



as of december 31 2016 the fair value of the afs and htm securities portfolio increased 14 billion  to 246 billion  compared with 232 billion  as of december 31 2015 driven by net purchases of 17 billion  in securities that were bought for liquidity management purposes and offset by a decrease in market value of 300 million  due to an increase in interest rates 

as of december 31 2016 the portfolio’s average effective duration was 43  years compared with 35  years as of december 31 2015 higher longterm rates reduced prepayment speed forecasts on mortgages extending the duration on mortgage backed securities the increase in securities duration was most pronounced in the fourth quarter of 2016 as interest rates increased significantly in this period we manage the securities portfolio duration through asset selection and securities structure which combine to limit the duration extension 

the securities portfolio includes high quality highly liquid investments reflecting our ongoing commitment to maintaining appropriate contingent liquidity and pledging capacity us governmentguaranteed notes and governmentsponsored entityissued mortgagebacked securities represent the vast majority of the securities portfolio holdings the portfolio composition is also dominated by holdings backed by mortgages to facilitate our ability to pledge them to the fhlbs this has become increasingly important due to the enhanced liquidity requirements of the liquidity coverage ratio for further discussion of the liquidity coverage ratios see “regulation and supervision — liquidity standards” in part i item 1 — business included in this report

noncore assets are primarily loans and leases inconsistent with our strategic priorities generally as a result of geographic location industry product type or risk level and are included in other noncore assets of 28 billion  as of december 31 2016   increase d 422 million  or 18  from december 31 2015  these results were driven by a 909 million  increase in total commercial noncore loans related to the transfer of a 12 billion lease and loan portfolio tied to legacy rbs aircraft leasing borrowers that we placed in runoff following a review of asset finance in third quarter 2016 the increase in total commercial noncore loans was partially offset by a 616 million decrease in total retail noncore loans 

retail noncore loan balances of 15 billion   decreased   616 million  or 29  compared to december 31 2015  the largest component of our retail noncore portfolio is the home equity sbo portfolio which totaled 969 million  as of december 31 2016  compared to 14 billion  as of december 31 2015  the sbo portfolio is a liquidating portfolio consisting of pools of home equity loans and lines of credit purchased between 2003 and 2007 although our sbo portfolio consists of loans that were initially serviced by others we now service a portion of this portfolio internally sbo balances serviced externally totaled 505 million  and 763 million  as of december 31 2016  and 2015 respectively the sbo portfolio has been closed to new purchases since the third quarter of 2007 the sbo portfolio represented 3  of the retail real estate secured portfolio and 2  of the overall retail loan portfolio as of december 31 2016  

the credit profile of the sbo portfolio was weaker than the core real estate portfolio with a weightedaverage refreshed fico score of 711  and cltv of 87  as of december 31 2016  the proportion of the portfolio in a second lien position was 96  with 71  of the portfolio in outoffootprint geographies including 27  in california nevada arizona and florida

the following table presents an allocation of the alll by class and the percent of each class of loans and leases to the total loans and leases 



the allowance for credit losses totaled 13 billion  at december 31 2016 and 2015 our alll was 115  of total loans and leases and 118  of nonperforming loans and leases as of december 31 2016  compared with 123  and 115  respectively as of december 31 2015  there were no material changes in assumptions or estimation techniques compared with prior periods that impacted the determination of the current period’s alll and the reserve for unfunded lending commitments however as part of the annual review of loss emergence periods the incurred loss periods for retail property secured loans were extended 

overall credit quality continued to improve reflecting growth in lower risk retail loans and modest increases in commercial categories nonperforming loans and leases of 10 billion  as of december 31 2016  decreased 15 million from december 31 2015  reflecting improvements in retail real estate secured categories offset by an increase in commercial nonperforming assets largely driven by commoditiesrelated businesses net chargeoffs of 335 million   increased   51 million  or 18  from 284 million  in 2015 as a 59 million increase in commercial largely tied to commoditiesrelated businesses and a reduction in commercial real estate recoveries more than offset an 8 million decrease in retail net chargeoffs of 032  of average total loans and leases remained relatively stable with 030  in 2015 see note 5 “allowance for credit losses nonperforming assets and concentrations of credit risk” to our audited consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 — financial statements and supplementary data included in this report

management’s discussion and analysis 

for commercial loans and leases we use regulatory classification ratings to monitor credit quality loans with a “pass” rating are those that we believe will be fully repaid in accordance with the contractual loan terms commercial loans and leases that are “criticized” are those that have some weakness that indicates an increased probability of future loss see note 5 “allowance for credit losses nonperforming assets and concentrations of credit risk” to our audited consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 — financial statements and supplementary data included in this report 

nonperforming commercial loans and leases increased   239 million  to 387 million  as of december 31 2016  from 148 million  as of december 31 2015  largely reflecting a 248 million increase tied to commoditiesrelated businesses partially offset by a 27 million reduction in commercial real estate these results also reflect the impact of revised regulatory guidance related to multitiered debt structures on the reservebased lending portion of the oil and gas portfolio as of december 31 2016  total commercial nonperforming loans were 07  of the commercial loan portfolio compared to 03  as of december 31 2015  total 2016 commercial loan and lease net chargeoffs of 46 million  increased from a net recovery of 13 million  in 2015 largely reflecting an increase tied to commoditiesrelated businesses and a reduction in commercial real estate recoveries of prior period chargeoffs

retail loan asset quality 

for retail loans we primarily utilize payment and delinquency status to monitor credit quality historical experience indicates that the longer a loan is past due the greater the likelihood of future credit loss these credit quality indicators are continually updated and monitored our retail loan portfolio remains focused on lending across the new england midatlantic and midwest regions with continued geographic expansion outside the footprint primarily in the auto finance student lending and unsecured portfolios retail assets increased 32 billion  to 560 billion  as of december 31 2016  a 60   increase  from december 31 2015  driven by growth in the student lending residential mortgage portfolios and other unsecured offset by continued runoff in home equity 

nonperforming retail loans as a percentage of total retail loans were 12  as of december 31 2016  a decrease of 50  basis points from december 31 2015  driven primarily by the third quarter 2016 tdr transaction and the first quarter 2016 reclassification of residential mortgage loans guaranteed by government entities to accruing status in keeping with industry practice nonperforming balances at december 31 2016  also excluded 50 million of government guaranteed loans 

the credit composition of our retail loan portfolio at december 31 2016  remained favorable and wellpositioned across all product lines with an average refreshed fico score of 759  improving two points from december 31 2015  as we continue to put high quality assets in our retail portfolio the real estate secured portfolio cltv ratio which is calculated as the mortgage and second lien loan balance divided by the appraised value of the property was 62  as of december 31 2016  compared to 64  as of december 31 2015  retail asset quality continued to improve with a net chargeoff rate core and noncore of 053  for the year ended   december 31 2016  a decrease of five  basis points from the year ended   december 31 2015  driven by broad improvement in the home equity student and other unsecured retail portfolios

troubled debt restructurings 

tdr is the classification given to a loan that has been restructured in a manner that grants a concession to a borrower experiencing financial hardship that we would not otherwise make tdrs typically result from our loss mitigation efforts and are undertaken in order to improve the likelihood of recovery and continuity of the relationship our loan modifications are handled on a casebycase basis and are negotiated to achieve mutually agreeable terms that maximize loan collectability and meet our borrower’s financial needs the types of concessions include interest rate reductions term extensions principal forgiveness and other modifications to the structure of the loan that fall outside our lending policy depending on the specific facts and circumstances of the customer restructuring can involve loans moving to nonaccrual remaining on nonaccrual or remaining on accrual status   

as of december 31 2016  799 million  of retail loans were classified as retail tdrs compared with 12 billion  as of december 31 2015  the decrease was driven by the impact of the third quarter 2016 sale of 310 million of retail tdrs including

in march and may 2016 we entered into receivefixed interestrate swaps totaling 750 million  and 10 billion  respectively to manage the interest rate exposure on a medium term debt issued in the same months these agreements converted the fixedrate debt coupon to threemonth libor based floating funding we receive a fixed rate of 106  and 117  respectively on the swap agreements and pay threemonth libor 

in february 2016 we terminated 30 billion  of twoyear original term receivefixed interest rate swaps that hedged the interest rate exposure on floating rate commercial loans the transaction resulted in a 13 million  gain which will be amortized over the remaining life of the swap 

we also sell interest rate swaps and foreign exchange forwards to commercial customers interest rate and foreign exchange derivative contracts are transacted to effectively minimize our market risk associated with the customer derivative contracts the assets and liabilities recorded for derivatives not designated as hedges reflect the market value of these transactions

management’s discussion and analysis 

the table below presents our derivative assets and liabilities for additional information regarding our derivative instruments see note 16 “derivatives” in our audited consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 — financial statements and supplementary data included in this report 



1 the notional or contractual amount of interest rate derivatives and foreign exchange contracts is the amount upon which interest and other payments under the contract are based for interest rate derivatives the notional amount is typically not exchanged therefore notional amounts should not be taken as the measure of credit or market risk as they do not measure the true economic risk of these contracts 

2 amounts represent the impact of legally enforceable master netting agreements that allow us to settle positive and negative positions 

3 we also offset assets and liabilities associated with repurchase agreements on our consolidated balance sheets see note 3 “securities” in our audited consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 — financial statements and supplementary data included in this report 

at december 31 2016  the overall derivative asset value increased 2 million  and the liability balance increased by 174 million  from december 31 2015  primarily due to higher fixed interest rates at december 31 2016  compared to december 31 2015

capital 

as a bank holding company and a financial holding company we are subject to regulation and supervision by the frbg our primary subsidiaries are our two insured depository institutions cbna a national banking association whose primary federal regulator is the occ and cbpa a pennsylvaniacharted savings bank regulated by the department of banking of the commonwealth of pennsylvania and supervised by the fdic as its primary federal regulator 

the us adoption of the basel iii standardized approach by all primary regulators became effective for the parent company cbna and cbpa on january 1 2015 subject to a phasein period for certain provisions among other changes these regulations introduced a new capital conservation buffer “ccb” on top of the following three minimum riskbased capital ratios cet1 capital of 45 tier 1 capital of 60 and total capital of 80 the implementation of the capital conservation buffer began on january 1 2016 at the 0625 level and will increase by 0625 on each subsequent january 1 until the buffer reaches its fully phasedin level of 25 on january 1 2019 banking institutions for which any riskbased capital ratio falls below its effective minimum required minimum plus the applicable capital conservation buffer will be subject to constraints on capital distributions including dividends repurchases and certain executive compensation based on the amount of the shortfall

standardized approach 

the parent company cbna and cbpa calculate regulatory ratios using the basel iii standardized approach as defined by us regulators for determining riskweighted assets under this approach no distinction is made for variations in credit quality for corporate exposures additionally the economic benefit of collateral is restricted to a limited list of eligible securities and cash at december 31 2016 we estimate our cet1 capital cet1 capital ratio and total riskweighted assets using the basel iii standardized approach on a fully phasedin basis to be 138 billion 111  and 1241 billion respectively our estimates may be refined over time because of further rulemaking or clarification by us banking regulators or as our understanding and interpretation of rules evolve 

the following table provides a reconciliation of regulatory ratios and ratio components using the basel iii standardized transitional rules and basel iii standardized estimates on a fullyphased in basis for common equity tier 1 capital total capital and riskweighted assets

regulatory capital ratios and capital composition 

cet1 capital under basel iii standardized transitional rules totaled 138 billion  at december 31 2016 and increased 433 million  from 134 billion  at december 31 2015 as growth in net income and amortization of deferred tax related to goodwill was partially offset by the impact of share repurchases and dividend payments tier 1 capital at december 31 2016 totaled 141 billion reflecting a 433 million increase from 136 billion at december 31 2015 driven by the changes in cet 1 capital noted above at december 31 2016 and 2015 we had 247 million  of 5500 fixedtofloating noncumulative perpetual preferred stock outstanding which qualified as additional tier 1 capital total capital of 173 billion  at december 31 2016 decreased 158 million  from december 31 2015 as the benefit of net income growth and amortization of deferred tax related to goodwill was more than offset by the impact of the redemption of subordinated debt share repurchases and dividend payments 

riskweighted assets based on basel iii standardized transitional rules at december 31 2016 totaled 1239 billion  up 98 billion  from december 31 2015 the primary drivers for this change were growth in commercial commercial real estate and student loan portfolios 

as of december 31 2016 the tier 1 leverage ratio decreased 52 basis points to 99  from 105  as of december 31 2015 this decline reflected the net impact of an 112 billion  increase in adjusted quarterly average total assets which drove an 84 basis point decline in the ratio and the previously noted increase in tier 1 capital which added 32 basis points to the ratio

capital adequacy process 

our assessment of capital adequacy begins with our risk appetite and risk management framework this framework provides for the identification measurement and management of material risks capital requirements are determined for actual and forecasted risk portfolios using applicable regulatory capital methodologies the assessment also considers the possible impacts of approved and proposed regulatory changes to future periods key analytical frameworks which enable assessment of capital adequacy versus unexpected loss supplement our base case forecast these supplemental frameworks include integrated stress testing as well as an internal capital adequacy requirement that builds on internally assessed economic capital requirements a robust governance framework supports our capital planning process this process includes capital management policies and procedures that document capital adequacy metrics and limits as well as our comprehensive capital contingency plan and the active engagement of both the legalentity boards and senior management in oversight and decisionmaking 

forwardlooking assessments of capital adequacy for us and for our banking subsidiaries feed development of capital plans that are submitted to the frbg and to bank regulators we prepare these plans in full compliance with the frbg’s capital plan rule and we participate annually in the frbg’s ccar review process in addition to the stress test requirements under ccar we also participate in semiannual stress tests required by the doddfrank act 

all distributions proposed under our 2016 capital plan were subject to consideration and approval by our board of directors prior to execution the timing and exact amount of dividends and share repurchases will depend on various factors including our capital position financial performance and market conditions all of the following capital actions were completed during the year ended december 31 2016 these were part of the 2016 capital plan to which the federal reserve indicated no objection

4  “tier 1 leverage ratio” is tier 1 capital divided by quarterly average total assets as defined under basel iii standardized approach 

cbna cet1 capital under basel iii standardized transitional rules totaled 112 billion  at december 31 2016 up 494 million  from 108 billion  at december 31 2015 reflecting the impact of net income growth partially offset by dividend payments at december 31 2016 cbna held minimal additional tier 1 capital total capital was 134 billion  at december 31 2016 an increase of 311 million  from december 31 2015 driven primarily by the increase in cet1 capital net of the redemption of subordinated debt 

cbna riskweighted assets based on basel iii standardized transitional rules at december 31 2016 of 1005 billion  increased 89 billion  from december 31 2015 driven by growth in commercial loans and commitments commercial real estate student residential mortgage and unsecured retail loans 

as of december 31 2016 cbna’s tier 1 leverage ratio decreased approximately 43 basis points to 103  from 107  as of december 31 2015 driven by a 90 billion increase in adjusted quarterly average total assets that drove a 90 basis point decline in the ratio partially offset by a 47 basis point increase for higher cet1 capital described above 

cbpa cet1 capital under basel iii standardized transitional rules totaled 31 billion  at december 31 2016 and increased 77 million  from 30 billion  at december 31 2015 as the impact of net income growth and amortization of deferred tax related to goodwill was partially offset by the impact of dividend payments at december 31 2016 there was no additional tier 1 capital cbpa total capital of 33 billion  at december 31 2016 decreased 226 million  from december 31 2015 driven by the redemption of subordinated debt partially offset by an increase in cet1 capital 

cbpa riskweighted assets based on basel iii standardized transitional rules at december 31 2016 of 244 billion  increased 12 billion  from december 31 2015 largely reflecting the impact of growth in student commercial commercial real estate and mortgage backed securities partially offset by a reduction in residential mortgage and auto 

citizens financial group inc 

management’s discussion and analysis 

as of december 31 2016 the cbpa tier 1 leverage ratio decreased 30 basis points to 88  from 91  as of december 31 2015 driven by an increase in adjusted quarterly average total assets of 20 billion  resulting in a 53 basis point decline in the ratio partially offset by a 23 basis point increase resulting from higher cet1 capital described above 

liquidity 

liquidity is defined as our ability to meet our cashflow and collateral obligations in a timely manner at a reasonable cost an institution must maintain current liquidity to meet its expected daily and forecasted cashflow requirements as well as contingent liquidity to meet unexpected stress scenario funding requirements as noted earlier reflecting the importance of meeting all unexpected and stressscenario funding requirements we identify and manage contingent liquidity consisting of excess cash balances at the frb unencumbered highquality and liquid securities and unused fhlb borrowing capacity separately we also identify and manage asset liquidity as a subset of contingent liquidity consisting of excess cash balances at the frb and unencumbered highquality securities at december 31 2016 our net overnight position which is defined as cash balance held at the frb less any overnight borrowings totaled 22 billion  we held 190 billion  in unencumbered highquality liquid assets and maintained undrawn fhlb borrowing capacity of 28 billion  this resulted in total contingent liquidity of 240 billion  and total asset liquidity of 212 billion  

we manage liquidity at the consolidated enterprise level and at the legal entity level including at the parent company cbna and cbpa 

cfg liquidity 

our primary sources of cash are i dividends and interest received from our banking subsidiaries as a result of investing in bank equity and subordinated debt and ii externally issued senior and subordinated debt our uses of liquidity include the following i routine cash flow requirements as a bank holding company including periodic share repurchases and payments of dividends interest and expenses ii needs of subsidiaries including our banking subsidiaries for additional equity and as required their needs for debt financing and iii extraordinary requirements for cash 

in 2016 we utilized 350 million in proceeds from the issuance of senior notes and 275 million in excess cash to repurchase 334 million of our 4082 subordinated notes due 2025 and 291 million of our 4023 subordinated notes due 2024 in 2016 we paid 430 million to repurchase 17332684 common shares at an average price of 2481 405 million was recorded in treasury stock and 25 million was recorded in additional paid in capital the repurchased shares are held in treasury stock 

our cash and cash equivalents represent a source of liquidity that can be used to meet various needs and totaled 551 million  as of december 31 2016 compared with 400 million  as of december 31 2015 

our liquidity risk is low for the following reasons i we have no material nonbanking subsidiaries and our banking subsidiaries are selffunding ii the capital structures of our banking subsidiaries are similar to our capital structure as of december 31 2016 our double leverage ratio the combined equity of our subsidiaries divided by our equity was 1021  and iii our other cash flow requirements such as operating expenses are relatively small 

banking subsidiaries’ liquidity 

in the ordinary course of business the liquidity of cbna and cbpa is managed by matching sources and uses of cash the primary sources of bank liquidity include i deposits from our consumer and commercial franchise customers ii payments of principal and interest on loans and debt securities and iii wholesale borrowings as needed and as described under “—liquidity risk management and governance” the primary uses of bank liquidity include i withdrawals and maturities of deposits ii payment of interest on deposits iii funding of loans and related commitments and iv funding of securities purchases to the extent that the banks have relied on wholesale borrowings uses also include payments of related principal and interest 

our banking subsidiaries’ major businesses involve taking deposits and making loans hence a key role of liquidity management is to ensure that customers have timely access to funds from deposits and loans liquidity management also involves maintaining sufficient liquidity to repay wholesale borrowings pay operating expenses and support extraordinary funding requirements when necessary 

from an external issuance perspective during 2014 we created a 30 billion global note program for cbna this debt represents a key source of unsecured term and stable funding that further diversifies the funding sources of cbna and creates a more peerlike funding structure for the consolidated enterprise on march 14 2016 we increased the size of this program from 30 billion to 50 billion also on march 14 2016 cbna issued 750 million in threeyear fixedrate senior notes and on may 13 2016 cbna issued 10 billion in fiveyear fixedrate senior notes on december 3 2015 cbna issued 750 million in threeyear fixedrate senior notes and on december 4 2014 cbna issued 15 billion in fixedrate senior notes consisting of 750 million of threeyear notes and 750 million in fiveyear notes

management’s discussion and analysis 

liquidity risk 

we define liquidity risk as the risk that an entity will be unable to meet its payment obligations in a timely manner we manage liquidity risk at the consolidated enterprise level and at the legal entity level including at the parent company cbna and cbpa liquidity risk can arise due to contingent liquidity risk andor funding liquidity risk 

contingent liquidity risk is the risk that market conditions may reduce an entity’s ability to liquidate pledge andor finance certain assets and thereby substantially reduce the liquidity value of such assets drivers of contingent liquidity risk include general market disruptions as well as specific issues regarding the credit quality andor valuation of a security or loan issuer or borrower andor asset class 

funding liquidity risk is the risk that market conditions andor entityspecific events may reduce an entity’s ability to raise funds from depositors andor wholesale market counterparties drivers of funding liquidity risk may be idiosyncratic or systemic reflecting impediments to operations andor damaged market confidence 

factors affecting liquidity 

given the composition of their assets and borrowing sources contingent liquidity risk at both cbna and cbpa would be materially affected by such events as deterioration of financing markets for highquality securities eg mortgagebacked securities and other instruments issued by the gnma fnma and the fhlmc by any inability of the fhlbs to provide collateralized advances andor by a refusal of the frb to act as lender of last resort in systemic stress 

similarly given the structure of their balance sheets the funding liquidity risk of cbna and cbpa would be materially affected by an adverse idiosyncratic event eg a major loss causing a perceived or actual deterioration in its financial condition an adverse systemic event eg default or bankruptcy of a significant capital markets participant or a combination of both eg the financial crisis of 20082010 however during the financial crisis our banking subsidiaries reduced their dependence on unsecured wholesale funding to virtually zero consequently and despite ongoing exposure to a variety of idiosyncratic and systemic events we view our contingent liquidity risk and our funding liquidity risk to be relatively modest 

an additional variable affecting our access and the access of our banking subsidiaries to unsecured wholesale market funds and to large denomination ie uninsured customer deposits is the credit ratings assigned by such agencies as moody’s standard  poor’s and fitch the following table presents our credit ratings 



changes in our public credit ratings could affect both the cost and availability of our wholesale funding as a result and in order to maintain a conservative funding profile our banking subsidiaries continue to minimize reliance on unsecured wholesale funding at december 31 2016 the majority of wholesale funding consisted of secured borrowings from the fhlbs collateralized by highquality residential mortgages 

existing and evolving regulatory liquidity requirements represent another key driver of systemic liquidity conditions and liquidity management practices the frbg the occ and the fdic regularly evaluate our liquidity as part of the overall supervisory process and the us version of the lcr was effective for us beginning january 2016 

citizens financial group inc 

management’s discussion and analysis 

the lcr was developed to ensure banks have sufficient highquality liquid assets to cover expected net cash outflows over a 30day liquidity stress period in september 2014 the us federal banking regulators published the final rule to implement the lcr this rule also introduced a modified version of the lcr in the united states which generally applies to bhcs not active internationally institutions with less than 10 billion of onbalance sheet foreign exposure with total assets of greater than 50 billion but less than 250 billion under this definition we are designated as a modified lcr financial institution as compared to the basel committee’s version of the lcr the version of the lcr issued by the us federal banking regulators includes a narrower definition of highquality liquid assets different prescribed cash inflow and outflow assumptions for certain types of instruments and transactions and a shorter phasein schedule that began on january 1 2015 and ends on january 1 2017 notably as a modified lcr financial institution we were required to be 90 compliant beginning in january 2016 and 100 compliant beginning in january 2017 achieving sustainable lcr compliance may require changes in the size andor composition of our investment portfolio the configuration of our discretionary wholesale funding portfolio and our average cash position we remain fully compliant with the lcr as of december 31 2016 

the us federal bank regulatory agencies have issued a notice of proposed rulemaking to implement the nsfr along with a modified version with similar parameters as the lcr that would designate us as a modified nsfr financial institution the nsfr is one of the two basel iiibased liquidity measures distinctly separate from the lcr and is designed to promote medium and longterm stable funding of the assets and offbalance sheet activities of banks and bank holding companies over a oneyear time horizon generally consistent with the basel committee’s framework under the proposed rule banking organizations would be required to hold an amount of available stable funding “asf” over a oneyear time horizon that equals or exceeds the institution’s amount of required stable funding “rsf” with the asf representing the numerator and the rsf representing the denominator of the nsfr the banking organizations subject to the modified nsfr would multiply the rsf amount by 70 such that the rsf amount required for these companies would be required to maintain asf of at least 70 of its rsf generally these modified nsfr companies are defined as institutions with total assets of greater than 50 billion but less than 250 billion and less than 10 billion of onbalance sheet foreign exposure the proposed rule includes detailed descriptions of the items that would comprise asf and rsf and standardized factors that would apply to asf and rsf items and would require any institution whose applicable modified nsfr falls under 100 to notify the appropriate federal regulator and develop a remediation plan 

we are currently evaluating the impact of the us federal bank regulatory agencies’ nsfr framework if ultimately adopted as currently proposed the implementation of the nsfr could impact our liquidity and funding requirements and practices in the future 

we continue to review and monitor these liquidity requirements to develop appropriate implementation plans and liquidity strategies we expect to be fully compliant with the final rules on or prior to the applicable effective date

liquidity risk is measured and managed by the funding and liquidity unit within our treasury unit in accordance with policy guidelines promulgated by our board and the asset and liability management committee in managing liquidity risk the funding and liquidity unit delivers regular and comprehensive reporting including current levels versus threshold limits for a broad set of liquidity metrics and early warning indicators explanatory commentary relating to emerging risk trends and as appropriate recommended remedial strategies 

the mission of our funding and liquidity unit is to deliver and otherwise maintain prudent levels of operating liquidity to support expected and projected funding requirements contingent liquidity to support unexpected funding requirements resulting from idiosyncratic systemic and combination stress events and regulatory liquidity to address current and emerging requirements such as the lcr and the nsfr additionally we will deliver this liquidity from stable funding sources in a timely manner and at a reasonable cost without significant adverse consequences 

we seek to accomplish this mission by funding loans with stable deposits by prudently controlling dependence on wholesale funding particularly shortterm unsecured funding and by maintaining ample available liquidity including a contingent liquidity buffer of unencumbered highquality loans and securities as of december 31 2016

management’s discussion and analysis 

 the funding and liquidity unit monitors a variety of liquidity and funding metrics and early warning indicators including specific risk thresholds limits these monitoring tools are broadly classified as follows 

 further certain of these metrics are monitored for each of us our banking subsidiaries and for our consolidated enterprise on a daily basis including net overnight position unencumbered securities internal liquidity and available fhlb borrowing capacity in order to identify emerging trends and risks and inform funding decisions specific metrics are also forecasted over a oneyear horizon 

moneyfund reform and other factors have incrementally increased borrowing rates for shortterm and unsecured bank liabilities however our utilization of unsecured and shortterm wholesale funding continues to be de minimis given our significant portfolio of high quality liquid assets our access to alternative funding sources including the fhlbs and the longterm capital markets and our strong franchise deposit base 

cash flows from operating activities contributed 15 billion  in 2016 net cash used by investing activities was 113 billion  primarily reflecting a net increase in loans and leases of 91 billion  and securities available for sale portfolio purchases of 77 billion  partially offset by proceeds from maturities paydowns and sales of securities available for sale of 58 billion  cash provided by financing activities was 105 billion  driven by proceeds from issuance of longterm borrowed funds of 151 billion  and a net increase in deposits of 73 billion  partially offset by repayments of longterm borrowed funds of 84 billion  and a net decrease in other shortterm borrowed funds of 32 billion  the 151 billion  proceeds included 13 billion from issuances of medium term debt and 138 billion in fhlb advances the 84 billion  of repayments includes 78 billion in repayments of fhlb advances and 625 million paid to repurchase subordinated debt these activities represented a cumulative increase in cash and cash equivalents of 619 million  which when added to the cash and cash equivalents balance of 31 billion  at the beginning of the year resulted in an ending balance of cash and cash equivalents of 37 billion  as of december 31 2016 

cash flows from operating activities contributed 12 billion in 2015 net cash used by investing activities was 59 billion primarily reflecting net securities available for sale portfolio purchases of 68 billion and a net increase in loans and leases of 60 billion partially offset by proceeds from maturities paydowns and sales of securities available for sale of 73 billion cash provided by financing activities was 45 billion driven by a net increase in deposits of 68 billion and proceeds from longterm borrowed funds of 68 billion partially offset by a decrease in federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreement to repurchase of 35 billion a decrease in other shortterm borrowed funds of 44 billion and repayments of longterm borrowed funds of 766 million these activities represented a cumulative decrease in cash and cash equivalents of 191 million which when added to the cash and cash equivalents balance of 33 billion at the beginning of the year resulted in an ending balance of cash and cash equivalents of 31 billion as of december 31 2015

critical accounting estimates 

our audited consolidated financial statements which are included in this report are prepared in accordance with gaap the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to establish accounting policies and make estimates that affect amounts reported in our audited consolidated financial statements 

an accounting estimate requires assumptions and judgments about uncertain matters that could have a material effect on our audited consolidated financial statements estimates are made using facts and circumstances known at a point in time changes in those facts and circumstances could produce results substantially different from those estimates the most significant accounting policies and estimates and their related application are discussed below

allowance for credit losses 

management’s estimate of probable losses in our loan and lease portfolios including unfunded lending commitments is recorded in the alll and the reserve for unfunded lending commitments at levels that we believe to be appropriate as of the balance sheet date the reserve for unfunded lending commitments are reported as a component of other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets our determination of such estimates is based on a periodic evaluation of the loan and lease portfolios and unfunded credit facilities as well as other relevant factors this evaluation is inherently subjective and requires significant estimates and judgments of underlying factors all of which are susceptible to change 

the alll and reserve for unfunded lending commitments could be affected by a variety of internal and external factors internal factors include portfolio performance such as delinquency levels assigned risk ratings the mix and level of loan balances differing economic risks associated with each loan category and the financial condition of specific borrowers external factors include fluctuations in the general economy unemployment rates bankruptcy filings developments within a particular industry changes in collateral values and factors particular to a specific commercial credit such as competition business and management performance the alll may be adjusted to reflect our current assessment of various qualitative risks factors and events that may not be measured in our statistical procedures there is no certainty that the alll and reserve for unfunded lending commitments will be appropriate over time to cover losses because of unanticipated adverse changes in any of these internal external or qualitative factors 

the evaluation of the adequacy of the commercial commercial real estate and lease alll and reserve for unfunded lending commitments is primarily based on risk rating models that assess probability of default “pd” loss given default “lgd” and exposure at default on an individual loan basis the models are primarily driven by individual customer financial characteristics and are validated against historical experience additionally qualitative factors may be included in the risk rating models after the aggregation of individual borrower incurred loss additional overlays can be made based on backtesting against historical losses and forward loss curve ratios 

for nonaccruing commercial and commercial real estate loans with an outstanding balance of 3 million or greater and for all commercial and commercial real estate tdrs regardless of size we conduct specific analysis on a loan level basis to determine the probable amount of credit loss if appropriate a specific alll is established for the loan through a charge to the provision for credit losses for all classes of impaired loans individual loan measures of impairment may result in a chargeoff to the alll if deemed appropriate in such cases the provision for credit losses is not affected when a specific reserve for at least that amount already exists techniques utilized include comparing the loan’s carrying amount to the estimated present value of its future cash flows the fair value of its underlying collateral or the loan’s observable market price the technique applied to each impaired loan is based on the workout officer’s opinion of the most probable workout scenario historically this has generally led to the use of the estimated present value of future cash flows approach the fair value of underlying collateral will be used if the loan is deemed collateral dependent for loans that use the fair value of underlying collateral approach a chargeoff assessment is performed quarterly to write the loans down to fair value 

for most nonimpaired retail loan portfolio types the alll is based upon the incurred loss model utilizing the pd lgd and exposure at default on an individual loan basis when developing these factors we may consider the loan product and collateral type delinquency status ltv ratio lien position borrower’s credit time outstanding geographic location and incurred loss period incurred loss periods are reviewed and updated at least annually and potentially more frequently when economic situations change rapidly as they tend to fluctuate with economic cycles incurred loss periods are generally longer in good economic times and shorter in bad times certain retail portfolios including sbo home equity loans student loans and credit card receivables utilize roll rate models to estimate the alll for the portfolios measured using the incurred loss model roll rate models are also used to support management overlays if deemed necessary 

for home equity lines and loans a number of factors impact the pd specifically the borrower’s current fico score the utilization rate delinquency statistics borrower income current cltv ratio and months on books are all used to assess the borrower’s creditworthiness similarly the loss severity is also impacted by various factors including the utilization rate the cltv ratio the lien position the housing price index change for the location as measured by the caseshiller index months on books and current loan balance 

when we are not in a first lien position we use delinquency information on the first lien exposures obtained from thirdparty credit information providers in the credit assessment for all first liens whether owned by a third party or by us an additional assessment is performed on a quarterly basis in this assessment the most recent three months’ performance of the senior liens is reviewed for delinquency 90 days or more past due modification foreclosure andor bankruptcy statuses if any derogatory status is present the junior lien will be placed on nonaccrual status regardless of its delinquency status on our books this subsequent change to nonaccrual status will alter the treatment in the pd model thus affecting the reserve calculation 

citizens financial group inc 

management’s discussion and analysis 

in addition the first lien exposure is combined with the second lien exposure to generate a cltv the cltv is a more accurate reflection of the leverage of the borrower against the property value as compared to the ltv from just the junior liens the cltv is used for modeling both the junior lien pd and lgd this also impacts the alll rates for the junior lien helocs 

the above measures are all used to assess the pd and lgd for heloc borrowers for whom we originated the loans there is also a portfolio of home equity products that were originated and serviced by others however we currently service some of the loans in this portfolio the sbo portfolio is modeled as a separate class and the reserves for this class are generated by using the delinquency roll rate models as described below 

for retail tdrs that are not collateraldependent allowances are developed using the present value of expected future cash flows compared to the recorded investment in the loans expected redefault factors are considered in this analysis retail tdrs that are deemed collateraldependent are written down to the fair market value of the collateral less costs to sell the fair value of collateral is periodically monitored subsequent to the modification 

changes in the levels of estimated losses can significantly affect management’s determination of an appropriate alll for consumer loans losses are affected by such factors as loss severity collateral values economic conditions and other factors a 1 and 5 increase in the estimated loss rate for consumer loans at december 31 2016 would have increased the alll by 6 million and 28 million respectively the alll for our commercial banking segment is sensitive to assigned credit risk ratings and inherent loss rates if 10 and 20 of the december 31 2016 year end loan balances including unfunded commitments within each risk rating category of our commercial banking segment had experienced downgrades of two risk categories the alll would have increased by 47 million and 93 million respectively 

commercial loans and leases are charged off to the alll when there is little prospect of collecting either principal or interest chargeoffs of commercial loans and leases usually involve receipt of borrowerspecific adverse information for commercial collateraldependent loans an appraisal or other valuation is used to quantify a shortfall between the fair value of the collateral less costs to sell and the recorded investment in the commercial loan retail loan chargeoffs are generally based on established delinquency thresholds rather than borrowerspecific adverse information when a loan is collateraldependent any shortfalls between the fair value of the collateral less costs to sell and the recorded investment is promptly charged off placing any loan or lease on nonaccrual status does not by itself require a partial or total chargeoff however any identified losses are charged off at that time

fair value 

we measure fair value using the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date fair value is based upon quoted market prices in an active market where available if quoted prices are not available observable marketbased inputs or independently sourced parameters are used to develop fair value whenever possible such inputs may include prices of similar assets or liabilities yield curves interest rates prepayment speeds and foreign exchange rates 

we classify our assets and liabilities that are carried at fair value in accordance with the threelevel valuation hierarchy 

 classification in the hierarchy is based upon the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement of the asset or liability for instruments classified in level 1 and 2 where inputs are primarily based upon observable market data there is less judgment applied in arriving at the fair value for instruments classified in level 3 management judgment is more significant due to the lack of observable market data 

significant assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis include our mortgagebacked securities available for sale these instruments are priced using an external pricing service and are classified as level 2 within the fair value hierarchy the service’s pricing models use predominantly observable valuation inputs to measure the fair value of these securities under both the market and income approaches the pricing service utilizes a matrix pricing methodology to price our us agency passthrough securities which involves making adjustments to tobeannounced security prices based on a matrix of various mortgagebacked 

citizens financial group inc 

management’s discussion and analysis 

securities characteristics such as weightedaverage maturities indices and other poollevel information other agency and nonagency mortgagebacked securities are priced using a discounted cash flow methodology this methodology includes estimating the cash flows expected to be received for each security using projected prepayment speeds and default rates based on historical statistics of the underlying collateral and current market conventions these estimated cash flows are then discounted using marketbased discount rates that incorporate characteristics such as average life volatility ratings performance of the underlying collateral and prevailing market conditions 

we review and update the fair value hierarchy classifications on a quarterly basis changes from one quarter to the next related to the observability of inputs in fair value measurements may result in a reclassification between the fair value hierarchy levels and are recognized based on yearend balances we also verify the accuracy of the pricing provided by our primary external pricing service on a quarterly basis this process involves using a secondary external vendor to provide valuations for our securities portfolio for comparison purposes any securities with discrepancies beyond a certain threshold are researched and if necessary valued by an independent outside broker 

fair value is also used on a nonrecurring basis to evaluate certain assets for impairment or for disclosure purposes examples of nonrecurring uses of fair value include mortgage servicing rights accounted for by the amortization method loan impairments for certain loans and goodwill 

the fair value of assets under operating leases is determined using collateral specific pricing digests external appraisals broker opinions recent sales data from industry equipment dealers and the discounted cash flows derived from the underlying lease agreement as market data for similar assets and lease agreements is available and used in the valuation these assets are classified as level 2 

for additional information regarding our fair value measurements see note 1 “significant accounting policies” note 3 “securities” note 10 “mortgage banking” note 16 “derivatives” and note 19 “fair value measurements” to our audited consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 — financial statements and supplementary data included in this report 

goodwill 

goodwill is an asset that represents the future economic benefits arising from other assets acquired in a business combination that are not individually identified and separately recognized goodwill is not amortized but is subject to annual impairment tests goodwill is assigned to reporting units at the date the goodwill is initially recorded a reporting unit is a business operating segment or a component of a business operating segment citizens has two reporting units with assigned goodwill the consumer segment and the commercial segment once goodwill has been assigned to reporting units it no longer retains its association with a particular acquisition and all of the activities within a reporting unit whether acquired or organically grown are available to support the value of the goodwill 

the goodwill impairment analysis is a twostep test the first step used to identify potential impairment involves comparing each reporting unit’s fair value to its carrying value including goodwill if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value applicable goodwill is deemed to be not impaired if the carrying value exceeds fair value there is an indication of impairment and the second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment 

the second step involves calculating an implied fair value of goodwill for each reporting unit for which the first step indicated impairment the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination which is the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit as determined in the first step over the aggregate fair values of the individual assets liabilities and identifiable intangible assets if the implied fair value of goodwill exceeds the carrying value of goodwill assigned to the reporting unit there is no impairment if the carrying value of goodwill assigned to a reporting unit exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill an impairment charge is recorded for the excess the impairment loss recognized cannot exceed the amount of goodwill assigned to a reporting unit and the loss establishes a new basis in the goodwill subsequent reversal of goodwill impairment losses is not permitted 

we review goodwill for impairment annually as of october 31 or more often if events or circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of one or more reporting units is below its carrying value we rely on the income approach discounted cash flow method as the primary method for determining fair value marketbased methods are used as benchmarks to corroborate the value determined by the discounted cash flow method 

we rely on several assumptions when estimating the fair value of our reporting units using the discounted cash flow method these assumptions include the discount rate loan loss provisions tax rate earnings and balance sheet growth rates terminal growth rate target capital ratios and a terminal value multiple discount rates are estimated based on the capital asset pricing model which considers the riskfree interest rate market risk premium and beta for the reporting units the discount rates are also calibrated on the assessment of the risks related to the projected cash flows of each reporting unit multiyear financial forecasts are developed for each reporting unit by considering several key business drivers such as new business initiatives customer retention standards market share changes anticipated loan and deposit growth forward interest rates historical performance and 

citizens financial group inc 

management’s discussion and analysis 

industry and economic trends among other considerations the longterm growth rate used in determining the terminal value of each reporting unit is estimated based on management’s assessment of the minimum expected terminal growth rate of each reporting unit as well as broader economic considerations such as gross domestic product and inflation 

we corroborate the fair value of our reporting units determined by the discounted cash flow method using marketbased methods a comparable company method and a comparable transaction method the comparable company method measures the fair value of a reporting unit by comparing it to publicly traded companies in similar lines of business this involves identifying and selecting the comparable companies based on a number of factors ie size growth profitability and risk calculating the market multiples ie pricetotangible book value pricetoearnings of these comparable companies and then applying these multiples to our operating results to estimate the value of the reporting unit’s equity on a marketable minority basis a control premium is then applied to this value to estimate the fair value of the reporting unit on a marketable controlling basis the comparable transaction method measures fair value of a reporting unit based on exchange prices in actual transactions that have comparable factors to the reporting units adjustments for differences in factors described earlier ie size growth profitability and risk are also considered 

we also corroborate the fair value of our reporting units determined by the discounted cash flow method by adding the aggregated sum of these fair value measurements to the fair value of our other segment operations and comparing this total to our observed market capitalization as part of this process we analyze the implied control premium to evaluate its reasonableness both positive and negative facts and circumstances are considered when completing this analysis including company and marketspecific factors observed transaction data and any additional external evidence supporting the implied control premium since none of our reporting units are publicly traded individual reporting unit fair value determinations cannot be directly correlated to our common stock price although we believe it is reasonable to conclude that market capitalization could be an indicator of fair value over time it may not reflect the aggregate fair value of our individual reporting units at a specific point in time the sum of the fair values of the reporting units at october 31 2016 exceeded the overall market capitalization of cfg as of october 31 2016 

we performed an annual test for impairment of goodwill for both reporting units as of october 31 2016 and assessed the indicators of goodwill impairment through december 31 2016 as of the testing date the percentage by which the fair value of our consumer banking reporting unit exceeded its carrying value was 19 and the percentage by which the fair value of our commercial banking reporting unit exceeded its carrying value was 12 therefore the results of this annual test indicated that the goodwill of each reporting unit was not impaired as of the testing date 

we based the fair value estimates used in our annual goodwill impairment testing on assumptions we believe to be representative of assumptions that a market participant would use in valuing the reporting units but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain including estimates of future growth rates and operating margins and assumptions about the overall economic climate and the competitive environment for our reporting units there can be no assurances that future estimates and assumptions made for purposes of goodwill testing will prove accurate predictions of the future if the assumptions regarding business plans competitive environments market conditions or anticipated growth rates are not achieved or a market participant view of our total fair value declines we may be required to record goodwill impairment charges in future periods

income taxes 

accrued income taxes are reported as a component of either other assets or other liabilities as appropriate in the consolidated balance sheets and reflect our estimate of income taxes to be paid or that effectively have been prepaid deferred income tax assets and liabilities represent the amount of future income taxes to be paid or that effectively have been prepaid and the net balance is reported as an asset or liability in the consolidated balance sheets we determine the realization of the deferred tax asset based upon an evaluation of the four possible sources of taxable income 1 the future reversals of taxable temporary differences 2 future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards 3 taxable income in prior carryback years and 4 tax planning strategies in projecting future taxable income we utilize forecasted pretax earnings adjust for the estimated book tax differences and incorporate assumptions including the amount of income allocable to taxing jurisdictions these assumptions require significant judgment and are consistent with the plans and estimates that we use to manage the underlying businesses the realization of the deferred tax assets could be reduced in the future if these estimates are significantly different than forecasted 

we are subject to income tax in the united states and multiple state and local jurisdictions the tax laws and regulations in each jurisdiction may be interpreted differently in certain situations which could result in a range of outcomes thus we are required to exercise judgment regarding the application of these tax laws and regulations we evaluate and recognize tax liabilities related to any tax uncertainties due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties the ultimate resolution may differ from the current estimate of tax liabilities or refunds

risk governance 

we are committed to maintaining a strong integrated and proactive approach to the management of all risks to which we are exposed in pursuit of our business objectives a key aspect of our board’s responsibility as the main decision making body is setting our risk appetite to ensure that the levels of risk that we are willing to accept in the attainment of our strategic business and financial objectives are clearly understood 

to enable our board to carry out its objectives it has delegated authority for risk management activities as well as governance and oversight of those activities to a number of board and executive management level risk committees the key committees that specifically consider risk across the enterprise are set out in the diagram below 

chief risk officer 

the cro directs our overall risk management function overseeing the credit interest rate  market liquidity operational compliance strategic and reputational risk management the cro reports to our ceo and to the board risk committee 

risk framework 

our risk management framework is embedded in our business through a “three lines of defense” model which defines responsibilities and accountabilities 

first line of defense 

the business lines including their associated support functions are the first line of defense and are accountable for owning and managing within our defined risk appetite the risks which exist in their respective business areas the business lines are responsible for performing regular risk assessments to identify and assess the material risks that arise in their area of responsibility complying with relevant risk policies testing and certifying the adequacy and effectiveness of their controls on a regular basis establishing and documenting operating procedures and establishing and owning a governance structure for identifying and managing risk 

citizens financial group inc 

management’s discussion and analysis 

second line of defense 

the second line of defense includes independent monitoring and control functions accountable for developing and ensuring implementation of risk and control frameworks and related policies this centralized risk function is appropriately independent from the business and is accountable for overseeing and challenging our business lines on the effective management of their risks this risk function utilizes training communications and awareness to provide expert support and advice to the business lines this includes interpreting the risk policy standards and risk management framework overseeing compliance by the businesses with policies and responsibilities including providing relevant management information and escalating concerns where appropriate 

the executive risk committee chaired by the cro actively considers our inherent material risks analyzes our overall risk profile and seeks confirmation that the risks are being appropriately identified assessed and mitigated 

third line of defense 

our internal audit function is the third line of defense providing independent assurance with a view of the effectiveness of citizens’ internal controls governance practices and culture so that risk is managed appropriately for the size complexity and risk profile of the organization internal audit has complete and unrestricted access to any and all bank records physical properties and personnel internal audit issues a report following each internal review and provides an audit opinion to citizens’ audit committees on a quarterly basis 

credit quality assurance also reports to the chief audit executive and also provides the legalentity boards senior management and other stakeholders with independent assurance on the quality of credit portfolios and adherence to agreed credit risk appetite and credit policies and processes in line with its procedures and regulatory expectations the credit quality assurance function undertakes a program of portfolio testing assessing and reporting through four risk pillars of asset quality rating and data integrity risk management and credit risk appetite 

risk appetite 

risk appetite is a strategic business and risk management tool we define our risk appetite as the maximum limit of acceptable risk beyond which we would either be unable to achieve our strategic objectives and capital adequacy obligations or would assume an unacceptable amount of risk to do so the board risk committee advises our board of directors in relation to current and potential future risk strategies including determination of risk appetite and tolerance 

the principal nonmarket risks to which we are subject are credit risk operational risk liquidity risk strategic risk and reputational risk we are also subject to market risks market risk refers to potential losses arising from changes in interest rates foreign exchange rates equity prices commodity prices andor other relevant market rates or prices modest market risk arises from trading activities that serve customer needs including hedging of interest rate and foreign exchange risk as described below more material market risk arises from our nontrading banking activities such as loan origination and deposit gathering we have established enterprisewide policies and methodologies to identify measure monitor and report market risk we actively manage both trading and nontrading market risks we are also subject to liquidity risk discussed under “—liquidity” 

our risk appetite framework and risk limit structure establishes guidelines to determine the balance between existing and desired levels of risk and supports the implementation measurement and management of our risk appetite 

credit risk 

overview 

credit risk represents the potential for loss arising from a customer counterparty or issuer failing to perform in accordance with the contractual terms of the obligation while the majority of our credit risk is associated with lending activities we do engage with other financial counterparties for a variety of purposes including investing asset and liability management and trading activities given the financial impact of credit risk on our earnings and balance sheet the assessment approval and management of credit risk represents a major part of our overall riskmanagement responsibility 

objective 

the credit risk management organization is responsible for approving credit transactions monitoring portfolio performance identifying problem loans and ensuring remedial management 

citizens financial group inc 

management’s discussion and analysis 

organizational structure 

management and oversight of credit risk is the responsibility of both the line of business and the second line of defense the second line of defense the independent credit risk function is led by the chief credit officer who oversees all of our credit risk the cco reports to the chief risk officer the cco acting in a manner consistent with board policies has responsibility for among other things the governance process around policies procedures risk acceptance criteria credit risk appetite limits and authority delegation the cco and his team also have responsibility for credit approvals for larger and higher risk transactions and oversight of line of business credit risk activities reporting to the cco are the heads of the second line of defense credit functions specializing in consumer banking commercial banking citizens restructuring management portfolio and corporate reporting alll analytics and credit policy and administration each team under these leaders is composed of highly experienced credit professionals 

the credit risk teams operate independently from the business lines to ensure decisions are not influenced by unbalanced objectives 

governance 

the primary mechanisms used to govern our credit risk function are our consumer and commercial credit policies these policies outline the minimum acceptable lending standards that align with our desired risk appetite material issues or changes are identified by the individual committees and presented to the credit policy committee executive risk committee and the board risk committee for approval as appropriate 

key management processes 

to ensure credit risks are managed within our risk appetite and business and risk strategies are achieved we employ a comprehensive and integrated control program the program’s objective is to proactively 1 identify 2 measure 3 monitor and 4 mitigate existing and emerging credit risks across the credit lifecycle origination account managementportfolio management and loss mitigation and recovery 

consumer 

on the consumer banking side of credit risk our teams use models to evaluate consumer loans across the lifecycle of the loan starting at origination credit scoring models are used to forecast the probability of default of an applicant these models are embedded in the loan origination system which allows for realtime scoring and automated decisions for many of our products periodic validations are performed on our purchased and proprietary scores to ensure fit for purpose when approving customers for a new loan or extension of an existing credit line credit scores are used in conjunction with other credit risk variables such as affordability length of term collateral value collateral type and lien subordination 

the origination process is supported by dedicated underwriting teams that reside in the business line the size of each team depends on the intensity of the approval process as the number of handoffs documentation and verification requirements differ substantially depending on the loan product 

to ensure proper oversight of the underwriting teams lending authority is granted by the second line of defense credit risk function to each underwriter the amount of delegated authority depends on the experience of the individual we periodically evaluate the performance of each underwriter and annually reauthorize their delegated authority only senior members of the second line of defense credit risk team are authorized to approve significant exceptions to credit policies it is not uncommon to make exceptions to established policies when compensating factors are present there are exception limits which when reached trigger a comprehensive analysis 

once an account is established credit scores and collateral values are refreshed at regular intervals to allow for proactive identification of increasing or decreasing levels of credit risk for accounts with contingent liability revolving feature credit policies have been developed that leverage the refreshed customer data to determine if a credit line should be increased decreased frozen or closed lastly behavioral modeling segmentation and loan modifications are used to cure delinquency reduce the severity of loss and maximize recoveries our approach to managing credit risk is highly analytical and where appropriate is automated to ensure consistency and efficiency 

the credit risk team is constantly evaluating current and projected economic conditions internal credit performance in relation to budget and predefined risk tolerances and current and expected regulatory guidance to determine the optimal balance of expansion and contraction policies all policy change proposals receive intense scrutiny and discussion prior to approval and implementation this process ensures decisions are made based on riskbased analytics with full adherence to regulatory requirements

commercial 

on the commercial banking side of credit risk the structure is broken into ci loans and leases and cre within ci loans and leases there are separate verticals established for certain specialty products eg assetbased lending leasing franchise finance health care technology midcorporate a “specialty vertical” is a standalone team of industry or product specialists substantially all activity that falls under the ambit of the defined industry or product is managed through a specialty vertical when one exists cre also operates as a specialty vertical 

commercial credit risk management begins with defined credit products and policies 

commercial transactions are subject to individual analysis and approval at origination and with few exceptions are subject to a formal annual review requirement the underwriting process includes the establishment and approval of credit grades that confirm the pd and lgd approval then requires both a business line approver and an independent credit approver with the requisite level of delegated authority the approval level of a particular credit facility is determined by the size of the credit relationship as well as the pd the checks and balances in the credit process and the independence of the credit approver function are designed to appropriately assess and sanction the level of credit risk being accepted facilitate the early recognition of credit problems when they occur and to provide for effective problem asset management and resolution all authority to grant credit is delegated through the independent credit risk function and is closely monitored and regularly updated 

the primary factors considered in commercial credit approvals are the financial strength of the borrower assessment of the borrower’s management capabilities cash flows from operations industry sector trends type and sufficiency of collateral type of exposure transaction structure and the general economic outlook while these are the primary factors considered there are a number of other factors that may be considered in the decision process in addition to the credit analysis conducted during the approval process at origination and annual review our credit quality assurance group performs testing to provide an independent review and assessment of the quality of the portfolio and new originations this group conducts portfolio reviews on a riskbased cycle to evaluate individual loans validate risk ratings as well as test the consistency of the credit processes and the effectiveness of credit risk management 

the maximum level of credit exposure to individual credit borrowers is limited by policy guidelines based on the perceived risk of each borrower or related group of borrowers concentration risk is managed through limits on industry sector loan type asset class and loan quality factors we focus predominantly on extending credit to commercial customers with existing or expandable relationships within our primary markets for this purpose defined as our 11 state footprint plus contiguous states although we do engage in lending opportunities outside our primary markets if we believe that the associated risks are acceptable and aligned with strategic initiatives 

apart from industrials and cre which together make up 30 of the commercial outstandings as of december 31 2016 there are no material sector concentrations as of december 31 2016 our cre outstandings amounted to 10 of total loans and leases the industrial sector includes basic ci lending focused on general manufacturing the sector is diversified and not managed as a specialized vertical our customers are local to our market and present no significant concentration 

our credit grading system considers many components that directly correlate to loan quality and likelihood of repayment our assessment of a borrower’s credit strength is reflected in our risk ratings for such loans which are also an integral component of our alll methodology when deterioration in credit strength is noted a loan becomes subject to watch review the watch review process involves senior representatives from the business line portfolio management team the independent credit risk team and our citizens restructuring management group as appropriate and consistent with regulatory definitions the credit may be subject to classification as either criticized or classified which would also trigger a credit rating downgrade as such the loan and relationship would be subject to more frequent review 

substantially all loans categorized as classified are managed by citizens restructuring management a specialized group of credit professionals that handles the daytoday management of workouts commercial recoveries and problem loan sales its responsibilities include developing and implementing action plans assessing risk ratings determining the appropriateness of specific reserves relating to the loan accrual status of the loan and the ultimate collectability of loans in their portfolio 

market risk 

market risk refers to potential losses arising from changes in interest rates foreign exchange rates equity prices commodity prices andor other relevant market rates or prices modest market risk arises from trading activities that serve customer needs including hedging of interest rate and foreign exchange risk as described below more material market risk arises from our nontrading banking activities such as loan origination and depositgathering we have established enterprisewide policies and methodologies to identify measure monitor and report market risk we actively manage both trading and nontrading market risks

management’s discussion and analysis 

nontrading risk 

we are exposed to market risk as a result of nontrading banking activities this market risk is composed entirely of interest rate risk as we have no direct currency or commodity risk and de minimis equity risk this interest rate risk emerges from the balance sheet after the aggregation of our assets liabilities and equity we refer to this nontrading risk embedded in the balance sheet as “structural interest rate risk” or “interest rate risk in the banking book” our mortgage servicing rights assets also contain interest rate risk as the value of the fee stream is impacted by the level of longterm interest rates 

a major source of structural interest rate risk is a difference in the repricing of assets on the one hand and liabilities and equity on the other first there are differences in the timing of rate changes reflecting the maturity andor repricing of assets and liabilities for example the rate earned on a residential mortgage may be fixed for 30 years the rate paid on a certificate of deposit may be fixed only for a few months due to these timing differences net interest income is sensitive to changes in the level and shape of the yield curve second there are differences in the drivers of rate changes of various assets and liabilities for example commercial loans may reprice based on onemonth libor or prime the rate paid on retail money market demand accounts may be only loosely correlated with libor and depend on competitive demand for funds due to these basis differences net interest income is sensitive to changes in spreads between certain indices or repricing rates 

another important source of structural interest rate risk relates to the potential exercise of explicit or embedded options for example most consumer loans can be prepaid without penalty and most consumer deposits can be withdrawn without penalty the exercise of such options by customers can exacerbate the timing differences discussed above 

a primary source of our structural interest rate risk relates to faster repricing of floating rate loans relative to the retail deposit funding this source of asset sensitivity is concentrated at the short end of the yield curve for the past seven years with the federal funds rate near zero this risk has been asymmetrical with significantly more upside benefit than potential exposure with interest rates starting to rise the risk position will become more symmetrical over time as rates can decline further before becoming floored at zero 

the secondary source of our interest rate risk is driven by longer term rates comprising the rollover or reinvestment risk on fixed rate loans as well as the prepayment risk on mortgage related loans and securities funded by nonrate sensitive deposits and equity 

the primary goal of interest rate risk management is to control exposure to interest rate risk within policy limits approved by the board these limits and guidelines reflect our tolerance for interest rate risk over both shortterm and longterm horizons to ensure that exposure to interest rate risk is managed within this risk appetite we must both measure the exposure and as necessary hedge it the treasury asset and liability management team is responsible for measuring monitoring and reporting on the structural interest rate risk position these exposures are reported on a monthly basis to the asset and liability committee “alco” and at board meetings 

we measure structural interest rate risk through a variety of metrics intended to quantify both shortterm and longterm exposures the primary method that we use to quantify interest rate risk is simulation analysis in which we model net interest income from assets liabilities and hedge derivative positions under various interest rate scenarios over a threeyear horizon exposure to interest rate risk is reflected in the variation of forecasted net interest income across scenarios 

key assumptions in this simulation analysis relate to the behavior of interest rates and spreads the changes in product balances and the behavior of loan and deposit clients in different rate environments the most material of these behavioral assumptions relate to the repricing characteristics and balance fluctuations of deposits with indeterminate ie noncontractual maturities as well as the pace of mortgage prepayments assessments are periodically made by running sensitivity analysis of the impact of key assumptions the results of these analyses are reported to alco 

as the future path of interest rates cannot be known in advance we use simulation analysis to project net interest income under various interest rate scenarios including a “most likely” implied forward scenario as well as a variety of deliberately extreme and perhaps unlikely scenarios these scenarios may assume gradual ramping of the overall level of interest rates immediate shocks to the level of rates and various yield curve twists in which movements in short or longterm rates predominate generally projected net interest income in any interest rate scenario is compared to net interest income in a base case where market forward rates are realized 

the table below reports net interest income exposures against a variety of interest rate scenarios exposures are measured as a percentage change in net interest income over the next year due to either instantaneous or gradual parallel  200 basis point moves in the market implied forward yield curve the net interest income simulation analyses do not include possible future actions that management might undertake to mitigate this risk the current limit is a decrease in net interest income of 13 related to an instantaneous  200 basis point move as the table illustrates our balance sheet is assetsensitive net interest income would benefit from an increase in interest rates exposure to a decline in interest rates is well within limit it should be noted that the magnitude of any possible decline in interest rates is constrained by the low absolute starting levels of rates while an instantaneous

management’s discussion and analysis 

and severe shift in interest rates was used in this analysis we believe that any actual shift in interest rates would likely be more gradual and would therefore have a more modest impact 

the table below presents the sensitivity of net interest income to various parallel yield curve shifts from the market implied forward yield curve 



asset sensitivity was 59 at december 31 2016 down modestly from 61 at december 31 2015 the core asset sensitivity is the result of a faster repricing of the loan book relative to the deposits the asset sensitive risk position is managed within our risk limits through occasional adjustments to securities investments interest rate swaps and mix of funding 

we use a valuation measure of exposure to structural interest rate risk economic value of equity “eve” as a supplement to net interest income simulations eve complements net interest income simulation analysis as it estimates risk exposure over a longterm horizon eve measures the extent to which the economic value of assets liabilities and offbalance sheet instruments may change in response to fluctuation in interest rates this analysis is highly dependent upon assumptions applied to assets and liabilities with noncontractual maturities the change in value is expressed as a percentage of regulatory capital the current risk limit is set at a decrease of 20 of regulatory capital given an instantaneous  200 basis point change in interest rates we are operating within that limit as of december 31 2016 

we also had market risk associated with the value of the mortgage servicing right assets which are impacted by the level of interest rates as of december 31 2016 and 2015 our mortgage servicing rights had a book value of 162 million and 164 million respectively and were carried at the lower of cost or fair value as of december 31 2016 and 2015 the fair value of the mortgage servicing rights was 182 million and 178 million respectively given low interest rates over recent years there is a valuation allowance of 5 million and 9 million on the asset as of december 31 2016 and 2015 respectively depending on the interest rate environment hedges may be used to stabilize the market value of the mortgage servicing right asset 

trading risk 

we are exposed to market risk primarily through client facilitation activities including derivatives and foreign exchange products exposure is created as a result of changes in interest rates and related basis spreads and volatility foreign exchange rates and credit spreads on a select range of interest rates foreign exchange and secondary loans instruments these trading activities are conducted through our two banking subsidiaries cbna and cbpa 

client facilitation activities consist primarily of interest rate derivatives and foreign exchange contracts where we enter into offsetting trades with a separate counterparty or exchange to manage our market risk exposure in addition to the aforementioned activities we operate a secondary loan trading desk with the objective to meet secondary liquidity needs of our issuing clients’ transactions and investor clients we do not engage in any trading activities with the intent to benefit from short term price differences 

we record interest rate derivatives and foreign exchange contracts as derivative assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets trading assets and liabilities are carried at fair value with income earned related to these activities included in net interest income changes in fair value of trading assets and liabilities are reflected in other income a component of noninterest income on the consolidated statements of operations

market risk governance   

the market risk limit setting process is established in line with the formal enterprise risk appetite process and policy this appetite reflects the strategic and enterprise level articulation of opportunities for creating franchise value set to the boundaries of how much market risk to take dealing authorities represent the key control tool in the management of market risk that allows the cascading of the risk appetite throughout the enterprise a dealing authority sets the operational scope and tolerances within which a business is permitted to operate and this is reviewed at least annually dealing authorities are structured to accommodate the client facing trades and hedges needed to manage the risk profile primary responsibility for keeping within established tolerances resides with the business key risk indicators including var open foreign currency positions and single name risk are monitored on a daily basis and reported against tolerances consistent with our risk appetite and business strategy to relevant business line management and risk counterparts 

market risk measurement 

we use var as a statistical measure for estimating potential exposure of our traded market risk in normal market conditions our var framework for risk management and regulatory reporting is the same risk management var is based on a one day holding period to a 99 confidence level whereas regulatory var is based on a ten day holding period to the same confidence level additional to var nonstatistical measurements for measuring risk are employed such as sensitivity analysis market value and stress testing 

our market risk platform and associated market risk and valuation models for our foreign exchange interest rate products and traded loans capture correlation effects and allow for aggregation of market risk across risk types business lines and legal entities we measure monitor and report market risk for both management and regulatory capital purposes 

valueatrisk overview 

  the market risk measurement model is based on historical simulation the var measure estimates the extent of any fair value losses on trading positions that may occur due to broad market movements general var such as changes in the level of interest rates foreign exchange rates equity prices and commodity prices it is calculated on the basis that current positions remain broadly unaltered over the course of a given holding period it is assumed that markets are sufficiently liquid to allow the business to close its positions if required within this holding period var’s benefit is that it captures the historic correlations of a portfolio based on the composition of our “covered positions” we also use a standardized addon approach for the loan trading desk’s specific risk capital which estimates the extent of any losses that may occur from factors other than broad market movements in addition for our secondary traded loans we calculate the var on the general interest rate risk embedded within the loans using a standalone model that replicates the general var methodology the related capital is reflected on the “de minimis” line in the following section the general var approach is expressed in terms of a confidence level over the past 500 trading days the internal var measure used as the basis of the main var trading limits is a 99 confidence level with a one day holding period meaning that a loss greater than the var is expected to occur on average on only one day in 100 trading days ie 1 of the time theoretically there should be a loss event greater than var two to three times per year the regulatory measure of var is done at a 99 confidence level with a 10day holding period the historical market data applied to calculate the var is updated on a ten business day lag refer to “market risk regulatory capital” below for details of our tenday var metrics for the quarters ended december 31 2016 and 2015 including high low average and period end valueatrisk for interest rate and foreign exchange rate risks as well as total var

market risk regulatory capital   

effective january 1 2013 the us banking regulators adopted “riskbased capital guidelines market risk” as the regulations covering the calculation of market risk capital the “market risk rule” the market risk rule commonly known as basel 25 substantially modified the determination of market riskweighted assets and implemented a more risk sensitive methodology for the risk inherent in certain trading positions categorized as “covered positions” for the purposes of the market risk rule all of our client facing trades and associated hedges needed to maintain a low risk profile to qualify as “covered positions” the internal management var measure is calculated based on the same population of trades that is utilized for regulatory var the following table presents the results of our modeled and nonmodeled measures for regulatory capital calculations 



1 the high and low for the portfolio may have occurred on different trading days than the high and low for the components therefore there is no diversification benefit shown for the high and low columns 

stressed var   

svar is an extension of var but uses a longer historical look back horizon that is fixed from january 3 2005 this is done not only to identify headline risks from more volatile periods but also to provide a counter balance to var which may be low during periods of low volatility the holding period for profit and loss determination is ten days svar is also a component of market risk regulatory capital svar for us is calculated daily under its own dynamic window regime in a dynamic window regime values of the tenday 99 var are calculated over all possible 260day periods that can be obtained from the complete historical data set refer to “market risk regulatory capital” above for details of svar metrics including high low average and period end svar for the combined portfolio 

sensitivity analysis   

sensitivity analysis is the measure of exposure to a single risk factor such as a one basis point change in rates or credit spread we conduct and monitor sensitivity on interest rates basis spreads foreign exchange exposures option prices and credit spreads whereas var is based on previous moves in market risk factors over recent periods it may not be an accurate predictor of future market moves sensitivity analysis complements var as it provides an indication of risk relative to each factor irrespective of historical market moves and is an effective tool in evaluating the appropriateness of hedging strategies 

stress testing   

conducting a stress test of a portfolio consists of running risk models with the inclusion of key variables that simulate various historical or hypothetical scenarios for historical stress tests profit and loss results are simulated for selected time periods corresponding to the most volatile underlying returns while hypothetical stress tests aim to consider concentration risk illiquidity under stressed market conditions and risk arising from the bank’s trading activities that may not be fully captured by its other models hypothetical scenarios also assume that the market moves happen simultaneously and that no repositioning or hedging activity takes place to mitigate losses as events unfold we generate stress tests of our trading positions on a daily basis for example we currently include a stress test that simulates a lehmantype crisis scenario by taking the worst 20trading day peak to trough moves for the various risk factors that go into var from that period and assumes they occurred simultaneously

var model review and validation   

market risk measurement models used are independently reviewed and subject to ongoing performance analysis by the model owner the independent review and validation focuses on the model methodology and performance independent review of market risk measurement models is the responsibility of citizens’ model risk management and validation team aspects covered include challenging the assumptions used the quantitative techniques employed and the theoretical justification underpinning them and an assessment of the soundness of the required data over time where possible the quantitative impact of the major underlying modeling assumptions will be estimated eg through developing alternative models results of such reviews are shared with us banking regulators the market risk models may be periodically enhanced due to changes in market price levels and price action regime behavior the market risk management and validation team will conduct internal validation before a new or changed model element is implemented and before a change is made to a market data mapping 

var backtesting   

backtesting is one form of validation of the var model the market risk rule requires a comparison of our internal var measure to the actual net trading revenue excluding fees commissions reserves intraday trading and net interest income for each day over the preceding year the most recent 250 business days any observed loss in excess of the var number is taken as an exception the level of exceptions determines the multiplication factor used to derive the var and svarbased capital requirement for regulatory reporting purposes we perform subportfolio backtesting as required under the market risk rule and as approved by our banking regulators for interest rate and foreign exchange positions the following graph shows our daily net trading revenue and total internal modeled var for the quarters ended december 31 2016 september 30 2016 june 30 2016 and march 31 2016

while our strategic plan and our rotce target and its components are presented with numerical specificity and we believe such targets to be reasonable given the uncertainties surrounding our assumptions there are significant risks that these assumptions may not be realized and thus our goals may not be achieved accordingly our actual results may differ from these targets and the differences may be material and adverse particularly if actual events adversely differ from one or more of our key assumptions we caution investors not to place undue reliance on any of these assumptions or targets 

we intend to deliver on this by adhering to the following strategic principles 

 in order to successfully execute on these principles we have developed the following strategic priorities each of which are underpinned by a series of initiatives as summarized below we have made solid progress on our strategic priorities and the underlying initiatives over the past year due primarily to the strength of our business model management team culture of accountability and risk management 

position consumer banking to deliver improved capabilities and profitability  consumer banking offers a “simple clear personal” value proposition to our customers the focus is on building strong customer relationships along with a robust product portfolio that is designed to be simple and easy to understand while creating a fair value exchange for our customers the following initiatives are being implemented to execute against our value proposition 

 these initiatives have already resulted in a stronger consumer franchise in 2015 highlighted by net checking account growth of approximately 28000 and nearly 22 million checking households additionally consumer banking average loans and leases of 515 billion for the year ended december 31 2015  grew 37 billion or 8 from the year ended december 31 2014

continue the momentum in commercial banking   we continue to see further buildout of the commercial banking business as critical to achieving a balanced business mix and consequently have grown the contribution of commercial loans to be 45 of operating segment loans the initiatives below have enabled the commercial banking business to continue its positive momentum while building upon existing strengths to further develop the “thought leadership” value proposition 

 the commercial banking business has continued to display solid financial results and executed well on these initiatives with loan portfolio growth of 39 billion or 10 yearoveryear along with strong deposit growth as average deposits increased 36 billion in 2015  or 18 compared to the average level of deposits for 2014  

grow the balance sheet to build scale and better leverage our cost base and infrastructure we have a scalable operating platform that has the capacity to accommodate a significantly larger balance sheet than our current size prior to the global financial crisis we had expanded to nearly 170 billion in assets which was then intentionally contracted in order to reposition the bank and strengthen our business profile through the run off of noncore assets and reduced dependency on wholesale funding 

over the past year we have begun to grow the consolidated balance sheet again through organic growth and selective portfolio purchases 

 balance sheet expansion is critical to executing on our strategic priority of enhancing our return profile and efficiency by better leveraging our existing capital position infrastructure and expense base 

develop a highperforming customercentric organization and culture  in the midst of an evolving and challenging business environment we are focused on delivering the best possible banking experience through our colleagues as such we strive to ensure that managers and colleagues are customer centric have a commitment to excellence and live the values and credo every day to further strengthen the organization’s health we have embarked on initiatives focused on recruiting talent management succession planning leadership development organizational structure and incentives

continue to embed risk management throughout the organization and build strong relationships with regulators  we remain committed to embedding a comprehensive enterprise risk management program across key management areas we continued to strengthen our capabilities by fully developing policies and risk appetite frameworks and standards clearly articulating roles and responsibilities across all lines of defense and enabling a culture that reinforces and rewards riskbased behaviors 

focus on improved efficiency and disciplined expense management  we believe that our focus on operational efficiency is critical to our profitability and ability to reinvest in the franchise we launched an initiative in late 2014  designed to improve the effectiveness efficiency and competitiveness of the franchise “project top” reflecting our ability to execute project top has achieved approximately 200 million of runrate expense savings by the end of 2015 as part of our continuous improvement efforts we began executing on the second phase of efficiency improvements as part of project top 2 as part of project top 2 there are several efficiency initiatives that focus on improving our operations and better discipline around our third party spend 

our strategic initiatives are focused on the fundamentals of growing customers relationships loans deposits total revenue and overall profitability while the above priorities are designed to enhance performance over the longterm successful execution to date has resulted in improved financial performance in 2015  as highlighted below 

 the adjusted results above are not recognized under gaap for more information on the computation of these nongaap financial measures see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — principal components of operations and key performance metrics used by management — key performance metrics and nongaap financial measures” in part ii item 7 included elsewhere in this report 

competition 

the financial services industry in general and in our branch footprint is highly competitive our branch footprint is in the new england midatlantic and midwest regions though certain lines of business serve broader national markets within those markets we face competition from community banks superregional and national financial institutions credit unions savings and loan associations mortgage banking firms consumer finance companies securities brokerage firms insurance companies and money market funds some of our larger competitors may make available to their customers a broader array of product pricing and structure alternatives while some smaller competitors may have more liberal lending policies and processes competition among providers of financial products and services continues to increase with consumers having the opportunity to select from a growing variety of traditional and nontraditional alternatives the ability of nonbanking financial institutions to provide services previously limited to commercial banks has intensified competition 

in consumer banking the industry has become increasingly dependent on and oriented towards technologydriven delivery systems permitting transactions to be conducted by telephone and computer as well as through online and mobile channels in addition technology has lowered the barriers to entry and made it possible for nonbank institutions to attract funds and provide lending and other financial services in our footprint despite not having a physical presence within our footprint given their lower cost structure these institutions are often able to offer rates on deposit products that are higher than what may be average for the market for retail banking institutions with a traditional branch footprint such as us the primary factors driving competition for loans and deposits are interest rates fees charged customer service levels convenience including branch location and hours of operation and the range of products and services offered in particular the competition for home equity lines and auto loans has intensified resulting in pressure on pricing 

in commercial banking there is intense competition for quality loan originations from traditional banking institutions particularly large regional banks as well as commercial finance companies leasing companies and other nonbank lenders and institutional investors including clo managers hedge funds and private equity firms some larger competitors including certain national banks that have a significant presence in our market area may offer a broader array of products and due to their asset size may sometimes be in a position to hold more exposure on their own balance sheet we compete on a number of factors including among others customer service quality of execution range of products offered price and reputation

intellectual property 

in the highly competitive banking industry in which we operate trademarks service marks trade names and logos are important to the success of our business we own and license a variety of trademarks service marks trade names logos and pending registrations and are spending significant resources to develop our standalone brands in connection with our initial public offering we entered into a trademark license agreement pursuant to which we were granted a limited license to use certain rbs trademarks including the daisywheel logo for an initial term of five years and at our option up to 10 years the trademark license agreement was partially terminated in 2015 in connection with rbs’s exit of its ownership interest in our common stock as part of the partial termination we were required to remove the “rbs” brand name from our products and services which we completed in the third quarter of 2015 under the agreement we lose the right to use the “rbs” acronym in connection with the marketing of any product or service as we rebrand and cease using the rbs brand in connection with such product or service subject to certain limited exceptions we have changed the legal names of substantially all of our subsidiaries that included “rbs” and have rebranded cfg and our banking subsidiaries 

information technology systems 

we have recently made and continue to make significant investments in our information technology systems for our banking lending and cash management activities we believe this is a necessary investment in order to offer new products and improve our overall customer experiences as well as to provide scale for future growth and acquisitions the technology investments include replacing systems that support our branch tellers commercial loans automobile loans and treasury solutions additional investments that are in process include creating an enterprise data warehouse to capture and manage data to better understand our customers identify our capital requirements and support regulatory reporting and a new mortgage system for our home lending solutions business 

regulation and supervision 

  our operations are subject to extensive regulation supervision and examination under federal and state law these laws and regulations cover all aspects of our business including lending practices safeguarding deposits customer privacy and information security capital structure transactions with affiliates and conduct and qualifications of personnel these laws and regulations are intended primarily for the protection of depositors the deposit insurance fund and the banking system as a whole and not for the protection of shareholders and creditors 

the doddfrank act and the rules that followed restructured the financial regulatory regime in the united states the doddfrank act represents a significant overhaul of many aspects of the regulation of the financial services industry addressing among other things systemic risk capital adequacy deposit insurance assessments consumer financial protection regulation of derivatives and securities markets restrictions on an insured bank’s transactions with its affiliates lending limits and mortgagelending practices various provisions of the doddfrank act continue to require the issuance of implementing regulations making it difficult to anticipate the ultimate overall impact to us our subsidiaries or the financial industry more generally although the overall impact cannot be predicted with any degree of certainty the doddfrank act will affect us across a wide range of areas 

as a general matter the federal banking agencies the frb the occ and the fdic as well as the cfpb are taking a more stringent approach to supervising and regulating financial institutions and financial products and services over which they exercise their respective supervisory authorities including in connection with enforcement matters we our two banking subsidiaries and our products and services are all subject to greater supervisory scrutiny and enhanced supervisory requirements and expectations and face significant challenges in meeting them we expect to continue to face greater supervisory scrutiny and enhanced supervisory requirements for the foreseeable future 

general 

cfg is a bank holding company under the bank holding company act of 1956 “bank holding company act” we have elected to be treated as a financial holding company under amendments to the bank holding company act as effected by glba we are subject to regulation supervision and examination by the frb including through the federal reserve bank of boston the frb serves as the primary regulator of our consolidated organization 

cbna is a national banking association as such it is subject to regulation examination and supervision by the occ as its primary federal regulator and by the fdic as the insurer of its deposits 

cbpa is a pennsylvaniachartered savings bank accordingly it is subject to supervision by the department of banking of the commonwealth of pennsylvania the “pa banking department” as its chartering agency and regulation supervision and examination by the fdic as the primary federal regulator of statechartered savings banks and as the insurer of its deposits 

a principal objective of the us bank regulatory system is to protect depositors by ensuring the financial safety and soundness of banks to that end the banking regulators have broad regulatory examination and enforcement authority the regulators regularly examine our operations and cfg and our banking subsidiaries are subject to periodic reporting requirements

the regulators have various remedies available if they determine that the financial condition capital resources asset quality earnings prospects management liquidity or other aspects of a banking organization’s operations are unsatisfactory the regulators may also take action if they determine that the banking organization or its management is violating or has violated any law or regulation the regulators have the power to among other things 

 cbna and cbpa are subject to various requirements and restrictions under federal and state law including requirements to maintain reserves against deposits restrictions on the types and amounts of loans that may be granted and the interest that may be charged and limitations on the types of investments that may be made activities that may be engaged in the opening and closing of branches and types of services that may be offered the consumer lending and finance activities of cbna and cbpa are also subject to extensive regulation under various federal and state laws these statutes impose requirements on the making enforcement and collection of consumer loans and on the types of disclosures that must be made in connection with such loans cbna and cbpa and certain of their subsidiaries are also prohibited from engaging in certain tiein arrangements in connection with extensions of credit leases or sales of property or furnishing products or services 

in addition cbna and cbpa are subject to regulation supervision and examination by the cfpb the cfpb has broad authority to among other things regulate the offering and provision of consumer financial products by depository institutions with more than 10 billion in total assets the cfpb may promulgate rules under a variety of consumer financial protection statutes including the truth in lending act the electronic funds transfer act and the real estate settlement procedures act 

financial holding company regulation 

glba permits a qualifying bank holding company to become a financial holding company financial holding companies may engage in a broader range of activities than those permitted for a bank holding company which are limited to i banking managing or controlling banks ii furnishing services to or performing services for subsidiaries and iii activities that the frb has determined to be so closely related to banking as to be a proper incident thereto glba broadens the scope of permissible activities for financial holding companies to include among other things securities underwriting and dealing insurance underwriting and brokerage merchant banking and other activities that are declared by the frb in cooperation with the treasury department to be “financial in nature or incidental thereto” or that the frb declares unilaterally to be “complementary” to financial activities in addition a financial holding company may conduct permissible new financial activities or acquire permissible nonbank financial companies with afterthefact notice to the frb 

we have elected to be treated as a financial holding company under amendments to the bank holding company act as effected by glba to maintain financial holding company status a financial holding company and its banking subsidiaries must remain well capitalized and well managed and maintain a cra rating of at least “satisfactory” if a financial holding company ceases to meet these requirements the frbs regulations provide that we must enter into an agreement with the frb to comply with all applicable capital and management requirements until the financial holding company returns to compliance the frb may impose limitations or conditions on the conduct of its activities and the company may not commence any of the broader financial activities permissible for financial holding companies or acquire a company engaged in such financial activities without prior approval of the frb in addition the failure to meet such requirements could result in other material restrictions on the activities of the financial holding company and may also adversely affect the financial holding company’s ability to enter into certain transactions including acquisition transactions or obtain necessary approvals in connection therewith any restrictions imposed on our activities by the frb may not necessarily be made known to the public if the company does not return to compliance within 180 days the frb may require divestiture of the financial holding company’s depository institutions failure to satisfy the financial holding company requirements could also result in loss of financial holding company status bank holding companies and banks must also be both well capitalized and well managed in order to acquire banks located outside their home state in addition if any insured depository institution subsidiary of a financial holding company fails to maintain at least a “satisfactory” rating under the community reinvestment act the financial holding company would be subject to similar activities restrictions 

citizens financial group inc 

business 

on march 13 2014 the occ determined that cbna no longer meets the condition to own a financial subsidiary  namely that cbna must be both well capitalized and well managed a financial subsidiary is permitted to engage in a broader range of activities similar to those of a financial holding company than those permissible for a national bank itself cbna has two financial subsidiaries citizens securities inc a registered brokerdealer and rbs citizens insurance agency inc a dormant entity cbna has entered into an agreement with the occ the “occ agreement” pursuant to which the company has developed and submitted to the occ a remediation plan that sets forth the specific actions it will take to bring itself back into compliance with the conditions to own a financial subsidiary cbna has made substantial progress toward completing those actions however until the plan has been completed to the occ’s satisfaction cbna will be subject to restrictions on its ability to acquire control or hold an interest in any new financial subsidiary and to commence new activities in any existing financial subsidiary without the prior consent of the occ 

separately our bank subsidiaries either together or separately are also making improvements to their compliance management systems fair lending compliance risk management identity theft and debt cancellation addon product practices overdraft fees and deposit reconciliation practices mortgage servicing thirdparty payment processor activities oversight of thirdparty providers consumer compliance program policies procedures and training information security consumer complaints process and antimoney laundering controls in order to address deficiencies in those areas these efforts require us to make investments in additional resources and systems and also require a significant commitment of managerial time and attention 

we are also required to make improvements to our overall compliance and operational risk management programs and practices in order to comply with enhanced supervisory requirements and expectations and to address weaknesses in retail credit risk management liquidity risk management model risk management outsourcing and vendor risk management and related oversight and monitoring practices and tools 

currently under the bank holding company act we may not be able to engage in certain categories of new activities or acquire shares or control of other companies other than in connection with internal reorganizations 

standards for safety and soundness 

the fdia requires the frb occ and fdic to prescribe operational and managerial standards for all insured depository institutions including cbna and cbpa the agencies have adopted regulations and interagency guidelines which set forth the safety and soundness standards used to identify and address problems at insured depository institutions before capital becomes impaired if an agency determines that a bank fails to satisfy any standard it may require the bank to submit an acceptable plan to achieve compliance consistent with deadlines for the submission and review of such safety and soundness compliance plans 

under section 616 of the doddfrank act which codifies the frb’s longstanding “source of strength” doctrine any bank holding company that controls an insured depository institution must serve as a source of financial and managerial strength for its depository institution subsidiary the statute defines “source of financial strength” as the ability to provide financial assistance in the event of the financial distress at the insured depository institution the frb may require a bank holding company to provide such support at times when it may not have the financial resources to do so or when doing so is not otherwise in the interests of cfg or its shareholders or creditors 

cbpa is also subject to supervision by the pa banking department the pa banking department may order any pennsylvaniachartered savings bank to discontinue any violation of law or unsafe or unsound business practice it may also order the termination of any trustee officer attorney or employee of a savings bank engaged in objectionable activity 

dividends 

various federal and state statutory provisions and regulations as well as regulatory expectations limit the amount of dividends that we and our subsidiaries may pay dividends payable by cbna as a national bank subsidiary are limited to the lesser of the amount calculated under a “recent earnings” test and an “undivided profits” test under the recent earnings test a dividend may not be paid if the total of all dividends declared by a bank in any calendar year is in excess of the current year’s net income combined with the retained net income of the two preceding years less any required transfers to surplus unless the national bank obtains the approval of the occ under the undivided profits test a dividend may be paid only to the extent that retained net profits as defined and interpreted by regulation including the portion transferred to surplus exceed bad debts as defined by regulation cbna is currently required to seek the occ’s approval prior to paying any dividends to us federal bank regulatory agencies have issued policy statements which provide that fdicinsured depository institutions and their holding companies should generally pay dividends only out of their current operating earnings under pennsylvania law cbpa may declare and pay dividends only out of accumulated net earnings and only if i any required transfer to surplus has been made prior to declaration of the dividend and ii payment of the dividend will not reduce surplus 

furthermore with respect to both cbna and cbpa if in the opinion of the applicable federal regulatory agency either is engaged in or is about to engage in an unsafe or unsound practice which depending on the financial condition of the bank could include the payment of dividends the regulator may require after notice and hearing that such bank cease and desist from 

citizens financial group inc 

business 

such practice the occ and the fdic have indicated that the payment of dividends would constitute an unsafe and unsound practice if the payment would reduce a depository institution’s capital to an inadequate level the banking agencies have significant discretion to limit or even preclude dividends even if the statutory quantitative thresholds are satisfied 

supervisory stress tests conducted by the frb in connection with its annual ccar process discussed in greater detail below affect our ability to make capital distributions as part of the ccar process the frb evaluates institutions’ capital adequacy and internal capital adequacy assessment processes to ensure that they have sufficient capital to continue operations during periods of economic and financial stress the frb must approve any planned distribution of capital in connection with the ccar process 

in march 2015 the frbg assessed our current capital plan as submitted and documented under the ccar process and raised no objection to the plan unless we choose to file an amended capital plan prior to april 2016 the maximum levels at which we may declare dividends and repurchase shares of our common stock through june 30 2016 are governed by our 2015 capital plan subject to actual financial performance and ongoing compliance with internal governance and all other regulatory requirements the payment of dividends after june 30 2016 will be subject to frb objection or nonobjection to our 2016 capital plan to be filed by april 5 2016 

in addition under the us basel iii capital framework described further below the ability of banks and bank holding companies to pay dividends and make other forms of capital distribution will also depend on their ability to maintain a sufficient capital conservation buffer above minimum riskbased ratio requirements that is composed entirely of cet1 capital the capital conservation buffer requirements began phasing in on january 1 2016 the ability of banks and bank holding companies to pay dividends and the contents of their respective dividend policies could be impacted by a range of regulatory changes made pursuant to the doddfrank act many of which still require final implementing rules to become effective in addition the frb generally limits a bank holding company’s ability to make quarterly capital distributions — that is dividends and share repurchases — commencing april 1 2015 if the amount of the bank’s actual cumulative quarterly capital issuances of instruments that qualify as regulatory capital are less than the bank had indicated in its submitted capital plan as to which it received a nonobjection from the frb subject to certain qualifications and exceptions 

federal deposit insurance act 

the fdia imposes various requirements on insured depository institutions for example the fdia requires among other things that the federal banking agencies take “prompt corrective action” in respect of depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements which are described below in “capital” the fdia sets forth the following five capital tiers “wellcapitalized” “adequately capitalized” “undercapitalized” “significantly undercapitalized” and “critically undercapitalized” a depository institution’s capital tier will depend upon how its capital levels compare with various relevant capital measures and certain other factors that are established by regulation 

the fdia prohibits any depository institution from making any capital distributions including payment of a dividend or paying any management fee to its parent holding company if the depository institution would thereafter be “undercapitalized” “undercapitalized” institutions are subject to growth limitations and are required to submit a capital restoration plan for a capital restoration plan to be acceptable among other things the depository institution’s parent holding company must guarantee that the institution will comply with the capital restoration plan if a depository institution fails to submit an acceptable capital restoration plan it is treated as if it is “significantly undercapitalized” “significantly undercapitalized” depository institutions may be subject to a number of requirements and restrictions including orders to sell sufficient voting stock to become “adequately capitalized” orders to elect a new board of directors requirements to reduce total assets and cessation of receipt of deposits from correspondent banks “critically undercapitalized” institutions are subject to the appointment of a receiver or conservator 

the fdia prohibits insured banks from accepting brokered deposits or offering interest rates on any deposits significantly higher than the prevailing rate in the bank’s normal market area or nationally depending upon where the deposits are solicited unless it is “wellcapitalized” or it is “adequately capitalized” and receives a waiver from the fdic a bank that is “adequately capitalized” and that accepts brokered deposits under a waiver from the fdic may not pay an interest rate on any deposit in excess of 75 basis points over certain prevailing market rates the fdia imposes no such restrictions on a bank that is “wellcapitalized” 

the fdia requires cbna and cbpa to pay deposit insurance assessments deposit insurance assessments are based on average consolidated total assets less average tangible equity and various other regulatory factors included in an fdic assessment scorecard deposit insurance assessments are also affected by the minimum reserve ratio with respect to the dif the minimum reserve ratio is currently 2 and the fdic is free to increase this ratio in the future in october 2015 the fdic issued a proposed rule that would increase the reserve ratio for the deposit insurance fund to 135 of total insured deposits the proposed rule would impose a surcharge on the assessments of larger depository institutions beginning the quarter after the reserve ratio first reaches or exceeds 115 and continuing through the earlier of the quarter that the reserve ratio first reaches or exceeds 135 and december 31 2018 under the proposed rule if the reserve ratio does not reach 135 by december 31 2018 the fdic would impose a shortfall assessment on larger depository institutions this may result in increased costs for cbna and cbpa

business 

because of the uncertainty as to the outcome of the fdics proposals we cannot provide any assurance as to the ultimate impact of any surcharges on the amount of deposit insurance expense reported in future periods 

under the fdia banks may also be held liable by the fdic for certain losses incurred or reasonably expected to be incurred by the dif either cbna and cbpa may be liable for losses caused by the other’s default and also may be liable for any assistance provided by the fdic to the other if it is in danger of default 

capital 

we must comply with capital adequacy standards established by the frb cbna and cbpa must comply with similar capital adequacy standards established by the occ and fdic respectively we currently have capital in excess of the “wellcapitalized” standards described below for more detail on our regulatory capital see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — capital” in part ii item 7 included elsewhere in this report 

in july 2013 the frb occ and fdic issued the us basel iii final rules the rules implement the basel committee on banking supervision’s basel iii capital framework and certain provisions of the doddfrank act including the collins amendment the us basel iii final rules substantially revised the riskbased capital and leverage requirements applicable to bank holding companies and their insured depository institution subsidiaries including cbna and cbpa the us basel iii final rules became effective for cfg and its depository institution subsidiaries including cbna and cbpa on january 1 2015 subject to a phasein period for certain provisions 

the us basel iii final rules among other things i introduced a new capital measure called cet1 ii specify that tier 1 capital consists of cet1 and “additional tier 1 capital” instruments meeting certain revised requirements iii define cet1 narrowly by requiring that most deductionsadjustments to regulatory capital measures be made to cet1 and not to the other components of capital and iv expand the scope of the deductions adjustments to capital as compared to existing regulations under the us basel iii final rules the minimum capital ratios effective as of january 1 2015 are 

 the us basel iii final rules also introduced a new “capital conservation buffer” composed entirely of cet1 on top of these minimum riskweighted asset ratios the implementation of the capital conservation buffer began on january 1 2016 at the 0625 level and will increase by 0625 on each subsequent january 1 until it reaches 25 on january 1 2019 banking institutions with a ratio of cet1 to riskweighted assets below the effective minimum 45 plus the capital conservation buffer and if applicable the countercyclical capital buffer will face constraints on dividends equity repurchases and compensation based on the amount of the shortfall 

when fully phased in on january 1 2019 the us basel iii final rules will require cfg cbna and cbpa to maintain an additional capital conservation buffer of 25 of cet1 effectively resulting in minimum ratios of i cet1 to riskweighted assets of at least 7 ii tier 1 capital to riskweighted assets of at least 85 iii a minimum ratio of total capital to riskweighted assets of at least 105 and iv a minimum leverage ratio of 4 

the us basel iii final rules also provide for a number of deductions from and adjustments to cet1 these include for example the requirement that certain deferred tax assets and significant investments in nonconsolidated financial entities be deducted from cet1 to the extent that any one such category exceeds 10 of cet1 or all such items in the aggregate exceed 15 of cet1 implementation of the deductions and other adjustments to cet1 began on january 1 2015 and will be phasedin over a 4year period beginning at 40 on january 1 2015 and an additional 20 per year thereafter 

the us basel iii final rules prescribe a standardized approach for risk weightings that expanded the riskweighting categories from the general riskbased capital rules to a much larger and more risksensitive number of categories depending on the nature of the assets generally ranging from 0 for us government and agency securities to 600 for certain equity exposures and resulting in higher risk weights for a variety of asset categories 

with respect to cbna and cbpa the us basel iii final rules also revise the “prompt corrective action” regulations pursuant to section 38 of the federal deposit insurance act as discussed above in “federal deposit insurance act” 

liquidity standards 

historically the frb had evaluated our liquidity as part of the supervisory process without required formulaic measures liquidity risk management and supervision have become increasingly important since the financial crisis in september 2014 the frb occ and fdic issued a final rule to implement the basel iiibased us lcr which is a quantitative liquidity metric 

citizens financial group inc 

business 

designed to ensure that a covered bank or bank holding company maintains an adequate level of unencumbered highquality liquid assets to cover expected net cash outflows over a 30day time horizon under an acute liquidity stress scenario the lcr rule as adopted applies in its most comprehensive form only to advanced approaches bank holding companies and depository institutions subsidiaries of such bank holding companies and in a modified form to bank holding companies having 50 billion or more in total consolidated assets such as cfg the modified version of the lcr differs in certain respects from the basel committee’s version of the lcr including a narrower definition of highquality liquid assets different prescribed cash inflow and outflow assumptions for certain types of instruments and transactions and a shorter phasein schedule that began on january 1 2015 and ends on january 1 2017 the rule is currently being phased in with 90 compliance required on january 1 2016 and 100 compliance required on january 1 2017 we are required to calculate our lcr on a monthly basis if a covered company fails to meet the required lcr it must promptly notify its primary federal banking regulator and may be required to take remedial actions under a rule proposed by the frb in november 2015 we would be required to disclose publicly information about certain components of our lcr beginning january 1 2018 at december 31 2015 our lcr was above the january 1 2016 requirement of 90 

the basel committee also has finalized its nsfr a quantitative liquidity metric designed to promote more medium and longterm funding of the assets and activities of banks over a oneyear time horizon although the basel committee finalized its formulation of the nsfr in 2014 contemplating a january 1 2018 effective date the us banking agencies have not yet proposed an nsfr for application to us banking organizations or addressed the scope of banking organizations to which it will apply 

in addition under the doddfrank act the frb has implemented enhanced prudential standards for bank holding companies with 50 billion or more in total consolidated assets see “—enhanced prudential standards” these regulations will require us to conduct regular liquidity stress testing over various time horizons and to maintain a buffer of higher liquid assets sufficient to cover expected net cash outflows and projected loss or impairment of funding sources for a shortterm liquidity stress scenario this liquidity buffer requirement is designed to complement the basel iiibased us lcr 

  capital planning and stress testing requirements 

bank holding companies with 50 billion or more in total consolidated assets such as cfg are required to develop and maintain a capital plan and to submit the capital plan to the frb for review under its ccar process ccar is designed to evaluate the capital adequacy capital adequacy process and planned capital distributions such as dividend payments and common stock repurchases of a bank holding company subject to ccar as part of ccar the frb evaluates whether a bank holding company has sufficient capital to continue operations under various scenarios of economic and financial market stress both bank holding company and frb developed including an “adverse” and “severely adverse” stress scenario developed by the federal reserve the frb will also evaluate whether the bank holding company has robust forwardlooking capital planning processes that account for its unique risks 

the capital plan must cover a “planning horizon” of at least nine quarters beginning with the quarter preceding the submission of the plan the frb has broad authority to object to capital plans and to require bank holding companies to revise and resubmit their capital plans bank holding companies are also subject to an ongoing requirement to revise and resubmit their capital plans upon the occurrence of certain events specified by rule or when required by the frb in addition to other limitations our ability to make any capital distributions including dividends and share repurchases is contingent on the frb’s nonobjection to our capital plan under both quantitative and qualitative tests should the frb object to a capital plan a bank holding company may not make any capital distribution other than those capital distributions that the frb has indicated nonobjection to in writing beginning in 2016 participating firms are required to submit their capital plans and stress testing results to the frb on or before april 5 of each year instead of on or before january 5 of each year under the prior rules 

the frb is expected to publish the decisions for all the bank holding companies participating in ccar 2016 including the reasons for any objection to capital plans by june 30 2016 in addition the federal reserve will separately publish the results of its supervisory stress test under both the supervisory severely adverse and adverse scenarios the information to be released will include among other things the frb’s projection of companyspecific information including poststress capital ratios and the minimum value of these ratios over the planning horizon 

the frb recently amended its capital planning and stress testing rules to among other things generally limit our ability to make quarterly capital distributions  that is dividends and share repurchases  commencing july 1 2016 if the amount of our actual cumulative quarterly capital issuances of instruments that qualify as regulatory capital are less than we had indicated in our submitted capital plan as to which we receive a nonobjection from the frb 

due to the importance and intensity of the stress tests and the ccar process we have dedicated significant resources to comply with stress testing and capital planning requirements and expect to continue to do so in the future

final regulations under the volcker rule 

the doddfrank act prohibits banks and their affiliates from engaging in proprietary trading and investing in sponsoring and having certain relationships with private funds such as hedge funds or private equity funds that would be an investment company for purposes of the investment company act of 1940 but for the exclusions in sections 3c1 or 3c7 of that act both subject to certain limited exceptions the statutory provision is commonly called the “volcker rule” in december 2013 the frb occ fdic the sec and the commodity futures trading commission issued final rules to implement the volcker rule on december 18 2014 the frb issued an order extending the volcker rule’s conformance period until july 21 2016 for investments in and relationships with “covered funds” and certain foreign funds that were in place on or prior to december 31 2013 subject to these extensions we had until july 2015 to comply with other provisions of the volcker rule these volcker rule prohibitions are expected to impact the ability of us banking organizations to provide investment management products and services that are competitive with nonbanking firms generally and with nonus banking organizations in overseas markets the volcker rule would also effectively prohibit shortterm trading strategies by any us banking organization if those strategies do not fall under the limited exceptions such as the exceptions for market makingrelated activities and riskmitigating hedging

frb and fdic regulations require a bank holding company with more than 50 billion in assets to annually submit a resolution plan that explains the company’s strategy in the event of material financial distress or failure for rapid orderly and systemically safe resolution if the frb and the fdic jointly determine that the resolution plan of a bank holding company is not credible and the company fails to cure the deficiencies in a timely manner then the frb and the fdic may jointly impose on the company or on any of its subsidiaries more stringent capital leverage or liquidity requirements or restrictions on growth activities or operations or require the divestment of certain assets or operations because rbs no longer controls us for bank regulatory purposes we will separately file our own bank holding company resolution plan with the frb and fdic in accordance with their regulations including required timelines 

in addition an insured depository institution with more than 50 billion in assets including cbna must submit to the fdic a resolution plan that explains how that institution could be resolved in a manner that is orderly and that ensures that depositors will receive access to insured funds within certain required timeframes on december 23 2015 we submitted our resolution plan for cbna to the fdic 

enhanced prudential standards 

the doddfrank act requires the frb to impose liquidity single counterparty credit limits risk management and other enhanced prudential standards for bank holding companies with 50 billion or more in total consolidated assets including us since january 1 2015 the enhanced prudential standards implemented by the frb have required subject bank holding companies to comply with enhanced liquidity and overall risk management standards and maintain a liquidity buffer of unencumbered highly liquid assets based on the results of internal liquidity stress testing the final rules also established certain requirements and responsibilities for our risk committee and mandates certain risk management standards although the liquidity buffer under these rules has some similarities to the lcr and is described by the agencies as complementary to the lcr it is a separate requirement that is in addition to the lcr final rules on single counterparty credit limits and an early remediation framework have not yet been promulgated 

  heightened risk governance standards 

in september 2014 the occ finalized guidelines that establish heightened standards for large national banks with average total consolidated assets of 50 billion or more including cbna the guidelines set forth minimum standards for the design and implementation of a bank’s risk governance framework and minimum standards for oversight of that framework by a bank’s board of directors the guidelines are an extension of the occ’s “heightened expectations” for large banks that the occ began informally communicating to certain banks in 2010 the guidelines are intended to protect the safety and soundness of covered banks and improve bank examiners’ ability to assess compliance with the occ’s expectations under the guidelines a bank could use certain components of its parent company’s risk governance framework but the framework must ensure that the bank’s risk profile is easily distinguished and separate from the parent for risk management and supervisory purposes a bank’s board of directors is required to have two members who are independent of the bank and parent company management a bank’s board of directors is responsible for ensuring that the risk governance framework meets the standards in the guidelines providing active oversight and a credible challenge to management’s recommendations and decisions and ensuring that the parent company decisions do not jeopardize the safety and soundness of the bank 

protection of customer personal information and cybersecurity 

the privacy provisions of glba generally prohibit financial institutions including us from disclosing nonpublic personal financial information of consumer customers to third parties for certain purposes primarily marketing unless customers have the 

citizens financial group inc 

business 

opportunity to opt out of the disclosure the fair credit reporting act restricts information sharing among affiliates for marketing purposes both the fair credit reporting act and regulation v issued by the frb govern the use and provision of information to consumer reporting agencies 

in march 2015 federal regulators issued two related statements regarding cybersecurity one statement indicates that financial institutions should design multiple layers of security controls to establish lines of defense and to ensure that their risk management processes also address the risk posed by compromised customer credentials including security measures to reliably authenticate customers accessing internetbased services of the financial institution the other statement indicates that a financial institution’s management is expected to maintain sufficient business continuity planning processes to ensure the rapid recovery resumption and maintenance of the institution’s operations after a cyber attack involving destructive malware a financial institution is also expected to develop appropriate processes to enable recovery of data and business operations and address rebuilding network capabilities and restoring data if the institution or its critical service providers fall victim to this type of cyber attack if we fail to observe the regulatory guidance we could be subject to various regulatory sanctions including financial penalties see item 1a risk factors for a further discussion of risks related to cybersecurity 

antitying restrictions 

generally a bank may not extend credit lease sell property or furnish any services or fix or vary the consideration for them on the condition that 1 the customer obtain or provide some additional credit property or services from or to that bank or its bank holding company or their subsidiaries or 2 the customer not obtain some other credit property or services from a competitor except to the extent reasonable conditions are imposed to assure the soundness of the credit extended a bank may however offer combinedbalance products and may otherwise offer more favorable terms if a customer obtains two or more traditional bank products certain foreign transactions are exempt from the general rule 

community reinvestment act requirements 

the cra requires the banking agencies to evaluate the record of us and our banking subsidiaries in meeting the credit needs of our local communities including low and moderate income neighborhoods the cra requires each appropriate federal bank regulatory agency in connection with its examination of a depository institution to assess such institution’s record in assessing and meeting the credit needs of the community served by that institution and assign ratings the regulatory agency’s assessment of the institution’s record is made available to the public these evaluations are also considered in evaluating mergers acquisitions and applications to open a branch or facility and in the case of a bank holding company that has elected financial holding company status a cra rating of “satisfactory” is required to commence certain new financial activities or to acquire a company engaged in such activities we received a rating of “satisfactory” in our mostrecent cra evaluation 

rules affecting debit card interchange fees 

interchange fees or “swipe” fees are charges that merchants pay to us and other cardissuing banks for processing electronic payment transactions frb rules applicable to financial institutions that have assets of 10 billion or more provide that the maximum permissible interchange fee for an electronic debit transaction is the sum of 21 cents per transaction and 5 basis points multiplied by the value of the transaction an upward adjustment of no more than 1 cent to an issuer’s debit card interchange fee is allowed if the card issuer develops and implements policies and procedures reasonably designed to achieve certain fraudprevention standards 

consumer financial protection regulations 

the retail activities of banks are subject to a variety of statutes and regulations designed to protect consumers loan operations are also subject to federal laws applicable to credit transactions such as 

 deposit operations also are subject to among others 

citizens financial group inc 

business 

 in addition to these federal laws and regulations the guidance and interpretations of the various federal agencies charged with the responsibility of implementing such regulations also influences loan and deposit operations 

the consumer protection provisions of the doddfrank act including the transfer of much of the rulemaking supervision and enforcement authority under various consumer financial laws to the cfpb and the cfpb’s subsequent regulatory supervisory and enforcement activity have created a more intense and complex environment for consumer finance regulation the cfpb is authorized to among other things engage in consumer financial education monitor consumer complaints request data and promote the availability of financial services to underserved consumers and communities the cfpb has significant authority to implement and enforce federal consumer finance laws including the truth in lending act the equal credit opportunity act the fair credit billing act and new requirements for financial services products provided for in the doddfrank act the cfpb also has examination and primary enforcement authority with respect to depository institutions with 10 billion or more in assets including the authority to prevent unfair deceptive or abusive practices in connection with the offering of consumer financial products we expect increased oversight of financial services products by the cfpb which are likely to affect our operations the review of products and practices to prevent such acts and practices is a continuing focus of the cfpb and of banking regulators more broadly the ultimate impact of this heightened scrutiny is uncertain but could result in changes to pricing practices products and procedures it also could result in increased costs related to regulatory oversight supervision and examination additional remediation efforts and possible penalties 

in addition the doddfrank act provides the cfpb with broad supervisory examination and enforcement authority over various consumer financial products and services including the ability to require reimbursements and other payments to customers for alleged legal violations and to impose significant penalties as well as injunctive relief that prohibits lenders from engaging in allegedly unlawful practices the cfpb also has the authority to obtain cease and desist orders providing for affirmative relief andor monetary penalties the doddfrank act and accompanying regulations including regulations to be promulgated by the cfpb are being phased in over time although some regulations have been promulgated many others have not yet been proposed or finalized for example the cfpb announced that it is considering new rules regarding debt collection practices and has proposed new regulations of prepaid accounts and proposed amendments to its regulations implementing the home mortgage disclosure act we cannot predict the terms of all of the final regulations their intended consequences or how such regulations will affect us or our industry 

the doddfrank act permits states to adopt stricter consumer protection laws and standards that are more stringent than those adopted at the federal level and in certain circumstances permits state attorneys general to enforce compliance with both the state and federal laws and regulations state regulation of financial products and potential enforcement actions could also adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

the cfpb has finalized a number of significant rules which will impact nearly every aspect of the life cycle of a residential mortgage the final rules require banks to among other things i develop and implement procedures to ensure compliance with a new “ability to repay” standard and identify whether a loan meets a new definition for a “qualified mortgage” ii implement new or revised disclosures policies and procedures for servicing mortgages including but not limited to early intervention with delinquent borrowers and specific loss mitigation procedures for loans secured by a borrower’s principal residence iii comply with additional restrictions on mortgage loan originator compensation and iv comply with new disclosure requirements and standards for appraisals and escrow accounts maintained for “higher priced mortgage loans” these new rules create operational and strategic challenges for us as we are both a mortgage originator and a servicer additional rulemaking affecting the residential mortgage business is also expected these rules and any other new regulatory requirements promulgated by the cfpb and other federal or state regulators could require changes to our business result in increased compliance costs and affect the streams of revenue of such business 

in addition our two banking subsidiaries are currently subject to consent orders issued by the occ and the fdic in connection with their findings of deceptive marketing and implementation of some of our checking account and funds transfer products and services among other things the consent orders require us to remedy deficiencies and develop stronger compliance controls policies and procedures we have made progress and continue to make progress in addressing these requirements but the consent orders remain in place and we are unable to predict when they may be terminated

commercial real estate lending 

lending operations that involve concentrations of commercial real estate loans are subject to enhanced scrutiny by federal banking regulators regulators have advised financial institutions of the risks posed by commercial real estate lending concentrations such loans generally include land development construction loans and loans secured by multifamily property and nonfarm nonresidential real property where the primary source of repayment is derived from rental income associated with the property the relevant regulatory guidance prescribes the following guidelines for examiners to help identify institutions that are potentially exposed to concentration risk and may warrant greater supervisory scrutiny 

 in 2009 the federal banking regulators issued additional guidance on commercial real estate lending that emphasizes these considerations 

in addition the doddfrank act contains provisions that may cause us to reduce the amount of our commercial real estate lending and increase the cost of borrowing including rules relating to risk retention of securitized assets section 941 of the doddfrank act requires among other things a loan originator or a securitizer of assetbacked securities to retain a percentage of the credit risk of securitized assets the banking agencies and other federal agencies have jointly promulgated a final rule to implement these requirements 

transactions with affiliates and insiders 

a variety of legal limitations restrict us from lending money to borrowing money from or in some cases transacting business with cbna and cbpa among such restrictions to which we are subject are sections 23a and 23b of the federal reserve act and frb regulation w section 23a places limits on certain specified “covered transactions” which include loans or extensions of credit to investments in or certain other transactions with affiliates as well as the amount of advances to third parties collateralized by the securities or obligations of affiliates the aggregate of all covered transactions is limited to 10 of a bank’s capital and surplus for any one affiliate and 20 for all affiliates furthermore within the foregoing limitations as to amount certain covered transactions must meet specified collateral requirements ranging from 100 to 130 also a bank is prohibited from purchasing lowquality assets from any of its affiliates section 608 of the doddfrank act broadens the definition of “covered transactions” to include derivative transactions and the borrowing or lending of securities if the transaction will cause a bank to have credit exposure to an affiliate the revised definition also includes the acceptance of debt obligations of an affiliate as collateral for a loan or extension of credit to a third party furthermore reverse repurchase transactions are viewed as extensions of credit instead of asset purchases and thus become subject to collateral requirements the federal reserve has not yet issued regulations to implement section 608 

section 23b prohibits an institution from engaging in certain transactions with affiliates unless the transactions are on terms substantially the same or at least as favorable to the bank as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with nonaffiliated companies except for limitations on lowquality asset purchases and transactions that are deemed to be unsafe or unsound regulation w generally excludes affiliated depository institutions from treatment as affiliates transactions between a bank and any of its subsidiaries that are engaged in certain financial activities may be subject to the affiliated transaction limits the frb also may designate banking subsidiaries as affiliates 

pursuant to frb regulation o we are also subject to quantitative restrictions on extensions of credit to executive officers directors principal stockholders and their related interests in general such extensions of credit i may not exceed certain dollar limitations ii must be made on substantially the same terms including interest rates and collateral as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with third parties and iii must not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features certain extensions of credit also require the approval of our board 

antimoney laundering 

the usa patriot act enacted in 2001 and renewed in 2006 substantially broadened the scope of us antimoney laundering laws and regulations by imposing significant new compliance and due diligence obligations creating new crimes and penalties and expanding the extraterritorial jurisdiction of the united states institutions must maintain antimoney laundering programs that include established internal policies procedures and controls a designated compliance officer an ongoing employee training program and testing of the program by an independent audit function we are prohibited from entering into specified financial transactions and account relationships and must meet enhanced standards for due diligence in dealings with foreign financial institutions and foreign customers we also must take reasonable steps to conduct enhanced scrutiny of account relationships to guard against money laundering and to report any suspicious transactions recent laws provide law enforcement authorities with increased access to financial information maintained by banks 

citizens financial group inc 

business 

the usa patriot act also provides for the facilitation of information sharing among governmental entities and financial institutions for the purpose of combating terrorism and money laundering the statute also creates enhanced information collection tools and enforcement mechanics for the us government including i requiring standards for verifying customer identification at account opening ii promulgating rules to promote cooperation among financial institutions regulators and law enforcement entities in identifying parties that may be involved in terrorism or money laundering iii requiring reports by nonfinancial trades and businesses filed with the treasury’s financial crimes enforcement network for transactions exceeding 10000 and iv mandating the filing of suspicious activities reports if a bank believes a customer may be violating us laws and regulations the statute also requires enhanced due diligence requirements for financial institutions that administer maintain or manage private bank accounts or correspondent accounts for nonus persons bank regulators routinely examine institutions for compliance with these obligations and are required to consider compliance in connection with the regulatory review of applications 

in addition the federal bureau of investigation may send bank regulatory agencies lists of the names of persons suspected of involvement in terrorist activities we can be requested to search our records for any relationships or transactions with persons on those lists and may be required to report any identified relationships or transactions 

office of foreign assets control regulation 

ofac is responsible for helping to ensure that us entities do not engage in transactions with certain prohibited parties as defined by various executive orders and acts of congress ofac publishes and routinely updates lists of names of persons and organizations suspected of aiding harboring or engaging in terrorist acts including the specially designated nationals and blocked persons we are responsible for among other things blocking accounts of and transactions with such targets and countries prohibiting unlicensed trade and financial transactions with them and reporting blocked transactions after their occurrence if we find a name on any transaction account or wire transfer that is on an ofac list we must freeze such account file a suspicious activity report and notify the appropriate authorities failure to comply with these sanctions could have serious legal and reputational consequences 

  other regulatory matters 

we and our subsidiaries and affiliates are subject to numerous examinations by federal and state banking regulators as well as the sec the finra and various state insurance and securities regulators in some cases regulatory agencies may take supervisory actions that may not be publicly disclosed and such actions may restrict or limit our activities or activities of our subsidiaries as part of our regular examination process our and our banking subsidiaries’ respective regulators may advise us or our banking subsidiaries to operate under various restrictions as a prudential matter we and our subsidiaries have from time to time received requests for information from regulatory authorities at the federal and state level including from state insurance commissions state attorneys general federal agencies or law enforcement authorities securities regulators and other regulatory authorities concerning their business practices such requests are considered incidental to the normal conduct of business 

in order to remedy certain weaknesses including the weaknesses cited by the frb in relation to our capital planning processes and the weaknesses we are working to remedy pursuant to the occ and fdic consent orders and meet our significant regulatory and supervisory challenges we believe we need to make substantial improvements to our processes systems and controls see note 17 “commitments and contingencies” to our audited consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 — financial statements and supplementary data included elsewhere in this report we expect to continue to dedicate significant resources and managerial time and attention and to make significant investments in enhanced processes systems and controls this in turn may increase our operational costs and limit our ability to implement aspects of our strategic plan or otherwise pursue certain business opportunities we also expect to make restitution payments to our banking subsidiaries’ customers which could be significant arising from certain customer compliance deficiencies and may be required to pay civil money penalties in connection with certain of these deficiencies we have established reserves in respect of these future payments but the amounts that we are ultimately obligated to pay could be in excess of our reserves moreover if we are unsuccessful in remedying these weaknesses and meeting the enhanced supervisory requirements and expectations that apply to us and our banking subsidiaries we could remain subject to existing restrictions or become subject to additional restrictions on our activities supervisory actions or public enforcement actions including the payment of civil money penalties

risk factors 




 item 1a risk factors 

we  are subject to a number of risks potentially impacting our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows as a financial services organization certain elements of risk are inherent in our transactions and operations and are present in the business decisions we make we therefore encounter risk as part of the normal course of our business and we design risk management processes to help manage these risks our success is dependent on our ability to identify understand and manage the risks presented by our business activities so that we can appropriately balance revenue generation and profitability these risks include but are not limited to credit risk market risk liquidity risk operational risk model risk technology regulatory and legal risk and strategic and reputational risk we discuss our principal risk management processes and in appropriate places related historical performance in the “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — risk governance” section in part ii item 7 of this report 

you should carefully consider the following risk factors that may affect our business financial condition and results of operations other factors that could affect our business financial condition and results of operation are discussed in the “forwardlooking statements” section above however there may be additional risks that are not presently material or known and factors besides those discussed below or elsewhere in this or other reports that we file or furnish with the sec that could also adversely affect us 

risks related to our business 

we may not be able to successfully execute our strategic plan or achieve our performance targets 

our strategic plan which we began to implement in the second half of 2013 involves four principal elements i increasing revenue in both consumer banking and commercial banking ii enhancing cost reduction efforts across the company iii taking capital actions aimed at better aligning our capital structure with those of regional bank peers and iv the beneficial impact of a rising interest rate environment on our assetsensitive balance sheet our future success and the value of our stock will depend in part on our ability to effectively implement our strategic plan there are risks and uncertainties many of which are not within our control associated with each element of our plan in addition certain of our key initiatives require regulatory approval which may not be obtained on a timely basis if at all moreover even if we do obtain required regulatory approval it may be conditioned on certain organizational changes such as those discussed below that could reduce the profitability of those initiatives if we are not able to successfully execute our strategic plan we may never achieve our indicative performance targets and any shortfall may be material 

in addition to the four principal elements of our strategic plan we also anticipate that our rotce will be affected by a number of additional factors we anticipate a benefit to our rotce from run off of our noncore portfolio which we expect will be offset by the negative impact on our rotce of some deterioration in the credit environment as they return to historical levels and a decline in gains on investments in securities we do not control many aspects of these factors or others and actual results could differ from our expectations materially which could impair our ability to achieve our strategic rotce goals see “business strategy” in part i item 1 — business  included elsewhere in this report for further information 

supervisory requirements and expectations on us as a financial holding company and a bank holding company our need to make improvements and devote resources to various aspects of our controls processes policies and procedures and any regulatorimposed limits on our activities could limit our ability to implement our strategic plan expand our business improve our financial performance and make capital distributions to our stockholders 

as a result of and in addition to new legislation aimed at regulatory reform such as the doddfrank act and the increased capital and liquidity requirements introduced by the us implementation of the basel iii framework the capital components of which have become effective the federal banking agencies the frb the occ and the fdic as well as the cfpb generally are taking a more stringent approach to supervising and regulating financial institutions and financial products and services over which they exercise their respective supervisory authorities we our two banking subsidiaries and our products and services are all subject to greater supervisory scrutiny and enhanced supervisory requirements and expectations and face significant challenges in meeting them we expect to continue to face greater supervisory scrutiny and enhanced supervisory requirements in the foreseeable future 

we also have been required to make improvements to our overall compliance and operational risk management programs and practices in order to comply with enhanced supervisory requirements and expectations and to address weaknesses in retail credit risk management liquidity risk management model risk management outsourcing and vendor risk management and related oversight and monitoring practices and tools our and our banking subsidiaries’ consumer compliance program and controls also require improvement in a variety of areas including with respect to deposit reconciliation processes fair lending and mortgage servicing in addition to the foregoing as part of the supevisory and examination process from time to time we and our banking subsidiaries may become and currently are subject to prudential restrictions on our activities similarly under the bank holding 

citizens financial group inc 

risk factors 

company act currently we may not be able to engage in certain categories of new activities or acquire shares or control of other companies other than in connection with internal reorganizations 

while we have made significant progress in enhancing our compliance and risk programs if we are unsuccessful in remedying these weaknesses and meeting the enhanced supervisory requirements and expectations that apply to us and our banking subsidiaries we could remain subject to existing restrictions or become subject to additional restrictions on our activities informal nonpublic or formal public supervisory actions or public enforcement actions including the payment of civil money penalties any such actions or restrictions if and in whatever manner imposed would likely increase our costs and could limit our ability to implement our strategic plans and expand our business and as a result could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations for more information regarding ongoing regulatory actions in which we are involved and certain identified past practices and policies for which we faced formal administrative enforcement actions see note 17 “commitments and contingencies” and note 21 “regulatory matters” to our audited consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 — financial statements and supplementary data included elsewhere in the report for further discussion 

a continuation of the current low interest rate environment or subsequent movements in interest rates may have an adverse effect on our profitability 

net interest income historically has been and in the neartomedium term we anticipate that it will remain a significant component of our total revenue this is due to the fact that a high percentage of our assets and liabilities have been and will likely continue to be in the form of interestbearing or interestrelated instruments changes in interest rates can have a material effect on many areas of our business including net interest income deposit costs loan volume and delinquency and value of our mortgage servicing rights interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond our control including general economic conditions and policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies and in particular the federal open market committee changes in monetary policy including changes in interest rates could influence not only the interest we receive on loans and securities and the amount of interest we pay on deposits and borrowings but such changes could also affect our ability to originate loans and obtain deposits and the fair value of our financial assets and liabilities if the interest rates on our interestbearing liabilities increase at a faster pace than the interest rates on our interest earning assets our net interest income and other financing income may decline and with it a decline in our earnings may occur our net interest income and other financing income and our earnings would be similarly affected if the interest rates on our interest earning assets declined at a faster pace than the interest rates on our interestbearing liabilities 

we cannot control or predict with certainty changes in interest rates global national regional and local economic conditions competitive pressures and the policies of regulatory authorities including monetary policies of the frb affect interest income and interest expense although we have policies and procedures designed to manage the risks associated with changes in market interest rates as further discussed under “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — risk governance” in part ii item 7 included elsewhere in this report changes in interest rates still may have an adverse effect on our profitability 

if our assumptions regarding borrower behavior are wrong or overall economic conditions are significantly different than we anticipate then our risk mitigation may be insufficient to protect against interest rate risk and our net income would be adversely affected 

we could fail to attract retain or motivate highly skilled and qualified personnel including our senior management other key employees or members of our board which could impair our ability to successfully execute our strategic plan and otherwise adversely affect our business 

a cornerstone of our strategic plan involves the hiring of a large number of highly skilled and qualified personnel accordingly our ability to implement our strategic plan and our future success depends on our ability to attract retain and motivate highly skilled and qualified personnel including our senior management and other key employees and directors competitive with our peers the marketplace for skilled personnel is becoming more competitive which means the cost of hiring incentivizing and retaining skilled personnel may continue to increase the failure to attract or retain including as a result of an untimely death or illness of key personnel or replace a sufficient number of appropriately skilled and key personnel could place us at a significant competitive disadvantage and prevent us from successfully implementing our strategy which could impair our ability to implement our strategic plan successfully achieve our performance targets and otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our ability to meet our obligations and the cost of funds to do so depend on our ability to access sources of liquidity and the particular sources available to us 

liquidity risk is the risk that we will not be able to meet our obligations including funding commitments as they come due this risk is inherent in our operations and can be heightened by a number of factors including an overreliance on a particular source of funding including for example secured fhlb advances changes in credit ratings or marketwide phenomena such 

citizens financial group inc 

risk factors 

as market dislocation and major disasters like many banking groups our reliance on customer deposits to meet a considerable portion of our funding has grown over recent years and we continue to seek to increase the proportion of our funding represented by customer deposits however these deposits are subject to fluctuation due to certain factors outside our control such as a loss of confidence by customers in us or in the banking sector generally increasing competitive pressures for retail or corporate customer deposits changes in interest rates and returns on other investment classes which could result in a significant outflow of deposits within a short period of time to the extent there is competition among us banks for retail customer deposits this competition may increase the cost of procuring new deposits andor retaining existing deposits and otherwise negatively affect our ability to grow our deposit base an inability to grow or any material decrease in our deposits could have a material adverse effect on our ability to satisfy our liquidity needs 

maintaining a diverse and appropriate funding strategy for our assets consistent with our wider strategic risk appetite and plan remains challenging and any tightening of credit markets could have a material adverse impact on us in particular there is a risk that corporate and financial institution counterparties may seek to reduce their credit exposures to banks and other financial institutions for example reflected in reductions in unsecured deposits supplied by these counterparties which may cause funding from these sources to no longer be available under these circumstances we may need to seek funds from alternative sources potentially at higher costs than has previously been the case or may be required to consider disposals of other assets not previously identified for disposal in order to reduce our funding commitments 

a reduction in our credit ratings which are based on a number of factors could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

credit ratings affect the cost and other terms upon which we are able to obtain funding rating agencies regularly evaluate us and their ratings are based on a number of factors including our financial strength other factors considered by rating agencies include conditions affecting the financial services industry generally any downgrade in our ratings would likely increase our borrowing costs could limit our access to capital markets and otherwise adversely affect our business for example a ratings downgrade could adversely affect our ability to sell or market in the capital markets certain of our securities including longterm debt engage in certain longerterm and derivatives transactions and retain our customers particularly corporate customers who may require a minimum rating threshold in order to place funds with us in addition under the terms of certain of our derivatives contracts we may be required to maintain a minimum credit rating or have to post additional collateral or terminate such contracts any of these results of a rating downgrade could increase our cost of funding reduce our liquidity and have adverse effects on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our financial performance may be adversely affected by deterioration in borrower credit quality particularly in the new england midatlantic and midwest regions where our operations are concentrated 

we have exposure to many different industries and risks arising from actual or perceived changes in credit quality and uncertainty over the recoverability of amounts due from borrowers is inherent in our businesses our exposure may be exacerbated by the geographic concentration of our operations which are predominately located in the new england midatlantic and midwest regions the credit quality of our borrowers may deteriorate for a number of reasons that are outside our control including as a result of prevailing economic and market conditions and asset valuation the trends and risks affecting borrower credit quality particularly in the new england midatlantic and midwest regions have caused and in the future may cause us to experience impairment charges increased repurchase demands higher costs additional writedowns and losses and an inability to engage in routine funding transactions which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our framework for managing risks may not be effective in mitigating risk and loss 

our risk management framework is made up of various processes and strategies to manage our risk exposure the framework to manage risk including the framework’s underlying assumptions may not be effective under all conditions and circumstances if the risk management framework proves ineffective we could suffer unexpected losses and could be materially adversely affected 

one of the main types of risks inherent in our business is credit risk an important feature of our credit risk management system is to employ an internal credit risk control system through which we identify measure monitor and mitigate existing and emerging credit risk of our customers as this process involves detailed analyses of the customer or credit risk taking into account both quantitative and qualitative factors it is subject to human error in exercising their judgment our employees may not always be able to assign an accurate credit rating to a customer or credit risk which may result in our exposure to higher credit risks than indicated by our risk rating system 

in addition we have undertaken certain actions to enhance our credit policies and guidelines to address potential risks associated with particular industries or types of customers as discussed in more detail under “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — risk governance” and “— market risk” in part ii item 7 included 

citizens financial group inc 

risk factors 

elsewhere in this report however we may not be able to effectively implement these initiatives or consistently follow and refine our credit risk management system if any of the foregoing were to occur it may result in an increase in the level of nonperforming loans and a higher risk exposure for us which could have a material adverse effect on us 

our accounting estimates and risk management framework rely on analytical forecasting and models 

the processes we use to estimate our inherent loan losses and to measure the fair value of financial instruments as well as the processes used to estimate the effects of changing interest rates and other market measures on our financial condition and results of operations depends upon the use of analytical and forecasting models some of our tools and metrics for managing risk are based upon our use of observed historical market behavior we rely on quantitative models to measure risks and to estimate certain financial values models may be used in such processes as determining the pricing of various products grading loans and extending credit measuring interest rate and other market risks predicting losses assessing capital adequacy and calculating regulatory capital levels as well as estimating the value of financial instruments and balance sheet items poorly designed or implemented models present the risk that our business decisions based on information incorporating such models will be adversely affected due to the inadequacy of that information moreover our models may fail to predict future risk exposures if the information used in the model is incorrect obsolete or not sufficiently comparable to actual events as they occur we seek to incorporate appropriate historical data in our models but the range of market values and behaviors reflected in any period of historical data is not at all times predictive of future developments in any particular period and the period of data we incorporate into our models may turn out to be inappropriate for the future period being modeled in such case our ability to manage risk would be limited and our risk exposure and losses could be significantly greater than our models indicated in addition if existing or potential customers believe our risk management is inadequate they could take their business elsewhere this could harm our reputation as well as our revenues and profits finally information we provide to our regulators based on poorly designed or implemented models could also be inaccurate or misleading some of the decisions that our regulators make including those related to capital distributions to our stockholders could be affected adversely due to their perception that the quality of the models used to generate the relevant information is insufficient 

the preparation of our financial statements requires the use of estimates that may vary from actual results particularly various factors may cause our alll to increase 

the preparation of audited consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make significant estimates that affect the financial statements our most critical accounting estimate is the alll the alll is a reserve established through a provision for loan and lease losses charged to expense and represents our estimate of incurred but unrealized losses within the existing portfolio of loans the alll is necessary to reserve for estimated loan and lease losses and risks inherent in the loan portfolio the level of the alll reflects our ongoing evaluation of industry concentrations specific credit risks loan and lease loss experience current loan portfolio quality present economic political and regulatory conditions and incurred losses inherent in the current loan portfolio 

the determination of the appropriate level of the alll inherently involves a degree of subjectivity and requires that we make significant estimates of current credit risks and future trends all of which may undergo material changes changes in economic conditions affecting borrowers the stagnation of certain economic indicators that we are more susceptible to such as unemployment and real estate values new information regarding existing loans identification of additional problem loans and other factors both within and outside our control may require an increase in the alll in addition bank regulatory agencies periodically review our alll and may require an increase in the alll or the recognition of further loan chargeoffs based on judgments that can differ from those of our own management in addition if chargeoffs in future periods exceed the alll—that is if the alll is inadequate—we will need additional loan and lease loss provisions to increase the alll should such additional provisions become necessary they would result in a decrease in net income and capital and may have a material adverse effect on us 

the value of our goodwill may decline in the future 

as of december 31 2015 we had 69 billion of goodwill a significant decline in our expected future cash flows a significant adverse change in the business climate substantially slower economic growth or a significant and sustained decline in the price of our common stock any or all of which could be materially impacted by many of the risk factors discussed herein may necessitate our taking charges in the future related to the impairment of our goodwill if we were to conclude that a future writedown of our goodwill is necessary we would record the appropriate charge which could be material to our operations for additional information regarding our goodwill impairment testing see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — critical accounting estimates” in part ii item 7 included elsewhere in this report 

operational risks are inherent in our businesses 

our operations depend on our ability to process a very large number of transactions efficiently and accurately while complying with applicable laws and regulations operational risk and losses can result from internal and external fraud errors by employees or third parties failure to document transactions properly or to obtain proper authorization failure to comply with

the financial services industry including the banking sector is undergoing rapid technological changes as a result of competition and changes in the legal and regulatory framework and we may not be able to compete effectively as a result of these changes 

the financial services industry including the banking sector is continually undergoing rapid technological change with frequent introductions of new technologydriven products and services in addition new unexpected technological changes could have a disruptive effect on the way banks offer products and services we believe our success depends to a great extent on our ability to use technology to offer products and services that provide convenience to customers and to create additional efficiencies in our operations however we may not be able to among other things keep up with the rapid pace of technological changes effectively implement new technologydriven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to our customers as a result our ability to compete effectively to attract or retain new business may be impaired and our business financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected 

in addition changes in the legal and regulatory framework under which we operate require us to update our information systems to ensure compliance our need to review and evaluate the impact of ongoing rule proposals final rules and implementation guidance from regulators further complicates the development and implementation of new information systems for our business also recent regulatory guidance has focused on the need for financial institutions to perform increased due diligence and ongoing monitoring of thirdparty vendor relationships thus increasing the scope of management involvement and decreasing the efficiency otherwise resulting from our relationships with thirdparty technology providers given the significant number of ongoing regulatory reform initiatives it is possible that we incur higher than expected information technology costs in order to comply with current and impending regulations see “—supervisory requirements and expectations on us as a financial holding company and a bank holding company  our need to make improvements and devote resources to various aspects of our controls processes policies and procedures and any regulatorimposed limits on our activities could limit our ability to implement our strategic plan expand our business   improve our financial performance and make capital distributions to our stockholders” 

cyberattacks distributed denial of service attacks and other cybersecurity matters if successful could adversely affect how we conduct our business 

we are under continuous threat of loss due to cyberattacks especially as we continue to expand customer capabilities to utilize the internet and other remote channels to transact business two of the most significant cyberattack risks that we face are efraud and loss of sensitive customer data loss from efraud occurs when cybercriminals extract funds directly from customers’ or our accounts using fraudulent schemes that may include internetbased funds transfers we have been subject to a number of efraud incidents historically we have also been subject to attempts to steal sensitive customer data such as account numbers and social security numbers through unauthorized access to our computer systems including computer hacking such attacks are less frequent but could present significant reputational legal and regulatory costs to us if successful 

recently there has been a series of distributed denial of service attacks on financial services companies including us distributed denial of service attacks are designed to saturate the targeted online network with excessive amounts of network traffic resulting in slow response times or in some cases causing the site to be temporarily unavailable generally these attacks are conducted to interrupt or suspend a company’s access to internet service the attacks can adversely affect the performance of a company’s website and in some instances prevent customers from accessing a company’s website we have implemented certain technology protections such as customer profiling and stepup authentication to be in compliance with the federal financial institutions examination council “ffiec” authentication in internet banking environment “aibe” guidelines however potential cyber threats that include hacking and other attempts to breach information technology security controls are rapidly evolving and we may not be able to anticipate or prevent all such attacks in the event that a cyberattack is successful our business financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected 

we rely heavily on communications and information systems to conduct our business 

we rely heavily on communications and information systems to conduct our business any failure interruption or breach in security of these systems including due to hacking or other similar attempts to breach information technology security protocols

risk factors 

could result in failures or disruptions in our customer relationship management general ledger deposit loan and other systems although we have established policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the effect of the possible failure interruption or security breach of our information systems there can be no assurance that these policies and procedures will be successful and that any such failure interruption or security breach will not occur or if they do occur that they will be adequately addressed the occurrence of any failure interruption or security breach of our information systems could damage our reputation result in a loss of customer business subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny or expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability 

we rely on third parties for the performance of a significant portion of our information technology 

we rely on third parties for the performance of a significant portion of our information technology functions and the provision of information technology and business process services for example i certain components and services relating to our online banking system rely on data communications networks operated by unaffiliated third parties ii many of our applications are hosted or maintained by third parties including our commercial loan system which is hosted and maintained by automated financial systems inc and iii our core deposits system is maintained by fidelity information services inc also in 2015 we entered into an agreement with ibm corporation for the provision of a wide range of information technology support services including end user data center network mainframe storage and database services the success of our business depends in part on the continuing ability of these and other third parties to perform these functions and services in a timely and satisfactory manner if we experience a disruption in the provision of any functions or services performed by third parties we may have difficulty in finding alternate providers on terms favorable to us and in reasonable timeframes if these services are not performed in a satisfactory manner we would not be able to serve our customers well in either situation our business could incur significant costs and be adversely affected 

we are exposed to reputational risk and the risk of damage to our brands and the brands of our affiliates 

our success and results depend in part on our reputation and the strength of our brands we are vulnerable to adverse market perception as we operate in an industry where integrity customer trust and confidence are paramount we are exposed to the risk that litigation employee misconduct operational failures the outcome of regulatory or other investigations or actions press speculation and negative publicity among other factors could damage our brands or reputation our brands and reputation could also be harmed if we sell products or services that do not perform as expected or customers’ expectations for the product are not satisfied 

we may be adversely affected by unpredictable catastrophic events or terrorist attacks and our business continuity and disaster recovery plans may not adequately protect us from serious disaster 

the occurrence of catastrophic events such as hurricanes tropical storms tornadoes and other largescale catastrophes and terrorist attacks could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations if a catastrophe rendered both our production data center in rhode island and our recovery data center in north carolina unusable although we recently enhanced our disaster recovery capabilities through the completion of the new outofregion backup data center in north carolina there can be no assurance that our current disaster recovery plans and capabilities will adequately protect us from serious disaster 

an inability to realize the value of our deferred tax assets could adversely affect operating results 

our net dtas are subject to an evaluation of whether it is more likely than not that they will be realized for financial statement purposes in making this determination we consider all positive and negative evidence available including the impact of recent operating results as well as potential carryback of tax to prior years’ taxable income reversals of existing taxable temporary differences tax planning strategies and projected earnings within the statutory tax loss carryover period we have determined that the dtas are more likely than not to be realized at december 31 2015  except for 123 million related to state dtas for which a valuation allowance was established if we were to conclude that a significant portion of the dtas were not more likely than not to be realized the required valuation allowance could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

we maintain a significant investment in projects that generate tax credits which we may not be able to fully utilize or if utilized may be subject to recapture or restructuring 

at december 31 2015  we maintained an investment of approximately 598 million in entities for which we receive allocations of tax credits which we utilize to offset our taxable income we accrued 45 million and 26 million in credits for the years ended december 31 2015  and 2014 respectively as of december 31 2015  all tax credits have been utilized to offset taxable income substantially all of these tax credits are related to development projects that are subject to ongoing compliance requirements over certain periods of time to fully realize their value if these projects are not operated in full compliance with the required terms the tax credits could be subject to recapture or restructuring further we may not be able to utilize any future tax credits if we are unable to utilize our tax credits or if our tax credits are subject to recapture or restructuring it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

any failure by us to successfully replicate or replace certain functions systems and infrastructure previously provided by rbs or fail to resolve conflicts of interest or disputes between rbs and us in areas relating to our past and ongoing relationships could have a material adverse effect on us 

we will need to replicate or replace certain functions systems and infrastructure to which we no longer have the same access since our separation from rbs including services we receive pursuant to the transitional services agreement we will also need to make infrastructure investments in order to operate without the same access to rbs’s existing operational and administrative infrastructure any failure to successfully implement these initiatives or to do so in a timely manner could have an adverse effect on us 

although rbs has fully exited its ownership stake in our common stock questions relating to conflicts of interest and actual disputes may arise between rbs and us in a number of areas relating to our past and ongoing relationships areas in which conflicts of interest or disputes between rbs and us could arise include but are not limited to interruptions to or problems with services provided under the transitional services agreement with rbs that increase our costs both for the processing of business and the potential remediation of disputes and other commercial and referral arrangements with rbs if we are unable to identify or execute on opportunities that offset any decrease or termination of any commercial relationships with rbs our financial results may be adversely affected moreover disagreements may arise between us and rbs regarding the provision or quality of any such services rendered which may materially adversely affect this portion of our business

any deterioration in national economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our business is affected by national economic conditions as well as perceptions of those conditions and future economic prospects changes in such economic conditions are not predictable and cannot be controlled adverse economic conditions could require us to charge off a higher percentage of loans and increase provision for credit losses which would reduce our net income and otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations for example our business was significantly affected by the global economic and financial crisis that began in 2008 the falling home prices increased rate of foreclosure and high levels of unemployment in the united states triggered significant writedowns by us and other financial institutions these writedowns adversely impacted our financial results in material respects although the us economy continues to recover an interruption or reversal of this recovery would adversely affect the financial services industry and banking sector 

we operate in an industry that is highly competitive which could result in losing business or margin declines and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we operate in a highly competitive industry the industry could become even more competitive as a result of reform of the financial services industry resulting from the doddfrank act and other legislative regulatory and technological changes as well as continued consolidation we face aggressive competition from other domestic and foreign lending institutions and from numerous other providers of financial services including nonbanking financial institutions that are not subject to the same regulatory restrictions as banks and bank holding companies securities firms and insurance companies and competitors that may have greater financial resources  

with respect to nonbanking financial institutions technology and other changes have lowered barriers to entry and made it possible for nonbanks to offer products and services traditionally provided by banks for example consumers can maintain funds that would have historically been held as bank deposits in brokerage accounts or mutual funds consumers can also complete transactions such as paying bills andor transferring funds directly without the assistance of banks the process of eliminating banks as intermediaries known as “disintermediation” could result in the loss of fee income as well as the loss of customer deposits and the related income generated from those deposits some of our nonbank competitors are not subject to the same extensive regulations we are and therefore may have greater flexibility in competing for business as a result of these and other sources of competition we could lose business to competitors or be forced to price products and services on less advantageous terms to retain or attract clients either of which would adversely affect our profitability and business 

the conditions of other financial institutions or of the financial services industry could adversely affect our operations and financial conditions 

financial services institutions that deal with each other are interconnected as a result of trading investment liquidity management clearing counterparty and other relationships within the financial services industry the default by any one institution could lead to defaults by other institutions concerns about or a default by one institution could lead to significant liquidity problems and losses or defaults by other institutions as the commercial and financial soundness of many financial institutions are closely related as a result of these credit trading clearing and other relationships even the perceived lack of creditworthiness of or questions about a counterparty may lead to marketwide liquidity problems and losses or defaults by various institutions this

risks related to regulations governing our industry 

as a financial holding company and a bank holding company we are subject to comprehensive regulation that could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

as a financial holding company and a bank holding company we are subject to comprehensive regulation supervision and examination by the frb in addition cbna is subject to comprehensive regulation supervision and examination by the occ and cbpa is subject to comprehensive regulation supervision and examination by the fdic and the pa banking department our regulators supervise us through regular examinations and other means that allow the regulators to gauge management’s ability to identify assess and control risk in all areas of operations in a safe and sound manner and to ensure compliance with laws and regulations in the course of their supervision and examinations our regulators may require improvements in various areas if we are unable to implement and maintain any required actions in a timely and effective manner we could become subject to informal nonpublic or formal public supervisory actions and public enforcement orders that could lead to significant restrictions on our existing business or on our ability to engage in any new business such forms of supervisory action could include without limitation written agreements cease and desist orders and consent orders and may among other things result in restrictions on our ability to pay dividends requirements to increase capital restrictions on our activities the imposition of civil monetary penalties and enforcement of such actions through injunctions or restraining orders we could also be required to dispose of certain assets and liabilities within a prescribed period the terms of any such supervisory or enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are a bank holding company that has elected to become a financial holding company pursuant to the bank holding company act financial holding companies are allowed to engage in certain financial activities in which a bank holding company is not otherwise permitted to engage however to maintain financial holding company status a bank holding company and all of its depository institution subsidiaries must be “well capitalized” and “well managed” if a bank holding company ceases to meet these capital and management requirements there are many penalties it would be faced with including i the frb may impose limitations or conditions on the conduct of its activities and ii it may not undertake any of the broader financial activities permissible for financial holding companies or acquire a company engaged in such financial activities without prior approval of the frb if a company does not return to compliance within 180 days which period may be extended the frb may require divestiture of that company’s depository institutions to the extent we do not meet the requirements to be a financial holding company in the future there could be a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we may be unable to disclose some restrictions or limitations on our operations imposed by our regulators 

from time to time bank regulatory agencies take supervisory actions that restrict or limit a financial institution’s activities and lead it to raise capital or subject it to other requirements directives issued to enforce such actions may be confidential and thus in some instances we are not permitted to publicly disclose these actions in addition as part of our regular examination process our and our banking subsidiaries’ respective regulators may advise us or our banking subsidiaries to operate under various restrictions as a prudential matter any such actions or restrictions if and in whatever manner imposed could adversely affect our costs and revenues moreover efforts to comply with any such nonpublic supervisory actions or restrictions may require material investments in additional resources and systems as well as a significant commitment of managerial time and attention as a result such supervisory actions or restrictions if and in whatever manner imposed could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations and in certain instances we may not be able to publicly disclose these matters 

the regulatory environment in which we operate could have a material adverse effect on our business and earnings 

we are heavily regulated by bank and other regulatory agencies at the federal and state levels this regulatory oversight is established to protect depositors the fdic’s deposit insurance fund and the banking system as a whole not security holders changes to statutes regulations rules or policies including the interpretation or implementation of statutes regulations rules or policies could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways including subjecting us to additional costs limiting the types of financial services and other products we may offer limiting our ability to pursue acquisitions and increasing the ability of third parties including nonbanks to offer competing financial services and products 

we are subject to capital adequacy and liquidity standards and if we fail to meet these standards our financial condition and operations would be adversely affected 

we are subject to several capital adequacy and liquidity standards to the extent that we are unable to meet these standards our ability to make distributions of capital will be limited and we may be subject to additional supervisory actions and limitations on our activities see “regulation and supervision” in part i item 1 — business and “management’s discussion and analysis

we could be required to act as a “source of strength” to our banking subsidiaries which would have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

frb policy historically required bank holding companies to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to their subsidiary banks the doddfrank act codified this policy as a statutory requirement this support may be required by the frb at times when we might otherwise determine not to provide it or when doing so is not otherwise in the interests of cfg or our stockholders or creditors and may include one or more of the following 

 we depend on our banking subsidiaries for most of our revenue and restrictions on dividends and other distributions by our banking subsidiaries could affect our liquidity and ability to fulfill our obligations 

as a bank holding company we are a separate and distinct legal entity from our banking subsidiaries cbna and cbpa we typically receive substantially all of our revenue from dividends from our banking subsidiaries these dividends are the principal source of funds to pay dividends on our equity and interest and principal on our debt various federal andor state laws and regulations as well as regulatory expectations limit the amount of dividends that our banking subsidiaries may pay to us also our right to participate in a distribution of assets upon a subsidiary’s liquidation or reorganization is subject to the prior claims of the subsidiary’s creditors in the event cbna or cpba is unable to pay dividends to us we may not be able to service debt pay obligations or pay dividends on our common stock the inability to receive dividends from cbna or cpba could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

see “supervision and regulation” in part i item 1 — business and and “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — capital” in part ii item 7 included elsewhere in this report 

we are and may be subject to regulatory actions that may have a material impact on our business 

we may become or are involved from time to time in reviews investigations and proceedings both formal and informal by governmental and selfregulatory agencies regarding our business these regulatory actions involve among other matters accounting consumer compliance and operational matters certain of which may result in adverse judgments settlements fines penalties injunctions or other relief that may require changes to our business or otherwise materially impact our business 

in regulatory actions such as those referred to above it is inherently difficult to determine whether any loss is probable or possible to reasonably estimate the amount of any loss we cannot predict with certainty if how or when such proceedings will be resolved or what the eventual fine penalty or other relief conditions or restrictions if any may be particularly for actions that are in their early stages of investigation we expect to make significant restitution payments to our banking subsidiaries’ customers arising from certain of the consumer compliance issues and also expect to pay civil money penalties in connection with certain of these issues adverse regulatory actions could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are and may be subject to litigation that may have a material impact on our business 

our operations are diverse and complex and we operate in legal and regulatory environments that expose us to potentially significant litigation risk in the normal course of business we have been named from time to time as a defendant in various legal actions including arbitrations class actions and other litigation arising in connection with our activities as a financial services institution including with respect to alleged unfair or deceptive business practices and misselling of certain products certain of the actual or threatened legal actions include claims for substantial compensatory andor punitive damages or claims for indeterminate amounts of damages in some cases the entities that would otherwise be the primary defendants in such cases are bankrupt or in financial distress moreover a number of recent judicial decisions have upheld the right of borrowers to sue lending institutions on the basis of various evolving legal theories collectively termed “lender liability” generally lender liability is

risk factors 

founded on the premise that a lender has either violated a duty whether implied or contractual of good faith and fair dealing owed to the borrower or has assumed a degree of control over the borrower resulting in the creation of a fiduciary duty owed to the borrower or its other creditors or stockholders this could increase the amount of private litigation to which we are subject for more information regarding ongoing significant legal proceedings in which we are involved and certain identified past practices and policies for which we could face potential civil litigation see note 17 “commitments and contingencies” to our audited consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 — financial statements and supplementary data included elsewhere in the report for further discussion 

the doddfrank act has changed and will likely continue to substantially change the legal and regulatory framework under which we operate our business 

congress and federal regulatory agencies continually review banking laws regulations and policies for possible changes the doddfrank act enacted in july 2010 instituted major changes to the banking and financial institutions regulatory regimes the doddfrank act represents a significant overhaul of many aspects of the regulation of the financialservices industry addressing among other things i systemic risk ii capital adequacy iii consumer financial protection iv interchange fees v mortgage lending practices and vi regulation of derivatives and securities markets a significant number of the provisions of the doddfrank act still require extensive rulemaking and interpretation by regulatory authorities in several cases authorities have extended implementation periods and delayed effective dates accordingly in many respects the ultimate impact of the doddfrank act and its effects on the us financial system and on us will not be known for an extended period of time see “ regulation and supervision” in part i item 1 — business included elsewhere in this report for further discussion of the regulations to which we are subject 

some of these and other major changes under the doddfrank act could materially impact the profitability of our business the value of assets we hold or the collateral available for coverage under our loans require changes to our business practices or force us to discontinue businesses and expose us to additional costs taxes liabilities enforcement actions and reputational risk 

the cfpb’s residential mortgage regulations could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

the cfpb finalized a number of significant rules that will impact nearly every aspect of the lifecycle of a residential mortgage these rules implement the doddfrank act amendments to the equal credit opportunity act the truth in lending act and the real estate settlement procedures act the final rules require banks to among other things i develop and implement procedures to ensure compliance with a new “reasonable ability to repay” test and identify whether a loan meets a new definition for a “qualified mortgage” ii implement new or revised disclosures policies and procedures for servicing mortgages including but not limited to early intervention with delinquent borrowers and specific loss mitigation procedures for loans secured by a borrower’s principal residence iii comply with additional restrictions on mortgage loan originator compensation and iv comply with new disclosure requirements and standards for appraisals and escrow accounts maintained for “higher priced mortgage loans” these new rules create operational and strategic challenges for us as we are both a mortgage originator and a servicer for example business models for cost pricing delivery compensation and risk management will need to be reevaluated and potentially revised perhaps substantially additionally programming changes and enhancements to systems will be necessary to comply with the new rules we also expect additional rulemaking affecting our residential mortgage business to be forthcoming these rules and any other new regulatory requirements promulgated by the cfpb and state regulatory authorities could require changes to our business in addition to the changes we have been required to make thus far such changes would result in increased compliance costs and potential changes to our product offerings which would have an adverse effect on the revenue derived from such business 

the doddfrank act’s consumer protection regulations could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

the frb enacted consumer protection regulations related to automated overdraft payment programs offered by financial institutions prior to the enactment of these regulations our overdraft and insufficient funds fees represented a significant amount of noninterest fees since taking effect on july 1 2010 the fees received by us for automated overdraft payment services have decreased thereby adversely impacting our noninterest income complying with these regulations has resulted in increased operational costs for us which may continue to rise the actual impact of these regulations in future periods could vary due to a variety of factors including changes in customer behavior economic conditions and other factors which could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations the cfpb has since then published additional studies of overdraft practices and has announced that it is considering enacting further regulations regarding overdrafts and related services 

the consumer protection provisions of the doddfrank act and the examination supervision and enforcement of those laws and implementing regulations by the cfpb have created a more intense and complex environment for consumer finance regulation the cfpb is authorized to engage in consumer financial education track consumer complaints request data and promote the availability of financial services to underserved consumers and communities we expect increased oversight of financial

risk factors 

services products by the cfpb which is likely to affect our operations the cfpb has significant authority to implement and enforce federal consumer finance laws including the truth in lending act the equal credit opportunity act the fair credit billing act and new requirements for financial services products provided for in the doddfrank act as well as the authority to identify and prohibit unfair deceptive or abusive acts and practices “udaap” the review of products and practices to prevent udaap is a continuing focus of the cfpb and of banking regulators more broadly the ultimate impact of this heightened scrutiny is uncertain but could result in changes to pricing practices products and procedures it could also result in increased costs related to regulatory oversight supervision and examination additional remediation efforts and possible penalties 

in addition the doddfrank act provides the cfpb with broad supervisory examination and enforcement authority over various consumer financial products and services including the ability to require reimbursements and other payments to customers for alleged legal violations and to impose significant penalties as well as injunctive relief that prohibits lenders from engaging in allegedly unlawful practices the cfpb also has the authority to obtain cease and desist orders providing for affirmative relief andor monetary penalties the doddfrank act and accompanying regulations including regulations to be promulgated by the cfpb are being phased in over time and while some regulations have been promulgated many others have not yet been proposed or finalized for example the cfpb has announced that it is considering new rules regarding debt collection practices and has proposed new regulations of prepaid accounts and proposed amendments to its regulations implementing the home mortgage disclosure act we cannot predict the terms of all of the final regulations their intended consequences or how such regulations will affect us or our industry 

the doddfrank act does not prevent states from adopting stricter consumer protection standards state regulation of financial products and potential enforcement actions could also adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

compliance with antimoney laundering and antiterrorism financing rules involve significant cost and effort 

we are subject to rules and regulations regarding money laundering and the financing of terrorism monitoring compliance with antimoney laundering and antiterrorism financing rules can put a significant financial burden on banks and other financial institutions and poses significant technical challenges although we believe our current policies and procedures are sufficient to comply with applicable rules and regulations we cannot guarantee that our antimoney laundering and antiterrorism financing policies and procedures completely prevent situations of money laundering or terrorism financing any such failure events may have severe consequences including sanctions fines and reputational consequences which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

we may become subject to more stringent regulatory requirements and activity restrictions or have to restructure if the frb and fdic determine that our resolution plan is not credible 

frb and fdic regulations require bank holding companies with more than 50 billion in assets to submit resolution plans that in the event of material financial distress or failure establish the rapid orderly and systemically safe liquidation of the company under the us bankruptcy code separately insured depository institutions with more than 50 billion in assets must submit to the fdic a resolution plan whereby they can be resolved in a manner that is orderly and that ensures that depositors will receive access to insured funds within certain required timeframes if the frb and the fdic jointly determine that the resolution plan of a bank holding company is not credible and the company fails to cure the deficiencies in a timely manner then the frb and the fdic may jointly impose on the company or on any of its subsidiaries more stringent capital leverage or liquidity requirements or restrictions on growth activities or operations or require the divestment of certain assets or operations if the frb and the fdic determine that our resolution plan is not credible or would not facilitate our orderly resolution under the us bankruptcy code we could become subject to more stringent regulatory requirements or business restrictions or have to divest certain of our assets or businesses any such measures could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

risks related to our common stock 

our stock price may be volatile and you could lose all or part of your investment as a result 

you should consider an investment in our common stock to be risky and you should invest in our common stock only if you can withstand a significant loss and wide fluctuation in the market value of your investment the market price of our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to among other things the factors described in this “risk factors” section and other factors some of which are beyond our control these factors include

risk factors 

 furthermore the stock markets have experienced price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market price of equity securities of many companies these fluctuations have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies 

these broad market fluctuations as well as general economic systemic political and market conditions such as recessions loss of investor confidence interest rate changes or international currency fluctuations may negatively affect the market price of our common stock 

if any of the foregoing occurs it could cause our stock price to fall and may expose us to securities class action litigation that even if unsuccessful could be costly to defend and a distraction to management 

we may not pay cash dividends on our common stock 

holders of our common stock are only entitled to receive such dividends as its board of directors may declare out of funds legally available for such payments although we have historically declared cash dividends on our common stock we are not required to do so and may reduce or eliminate our common stock dividend in the future this could adversely affect the market price of our common stock also as a bank holding company our ability to declare and pay dividends is dependent on certain federal regulatory considerations including the guidelines of the federal reserve board regarding capital adequacy and dividends additionally we are required to submit annual capital plans to the federal reserve for review before we can take certain capital actions including declaring and paying dividends and repurchasing or redeeming capital securities if our capital plan or any amendment to our capital plan is objected to for any reason our ability to declare and pay dividends on our capital stock may be limited further if we are unable to satisfy the capital requirements applicable to us for any reason we may be limited in our ability to declare and pay dividends on our capital stock see “regulation and supervision” in part i item 1 — business included elsewhere in this report for further discussion of the regulations to which we are subject 

“antitakeover” provisions and the regulations to which we are subject may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us even if the change in control would be beneficial to stockholders 

we are a bank holding company incorporated in the state of delaware antitakeover provisions in delaware law and our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws as well as regulatory approvals that would be required under federal law could make it more difficult for a third party to take control of us and may prevent stockholders from receiving a premium for their shares of our common stock these provisions could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and could reduce the amount that stockholders might get if we are sold 

we believe these provisions protect our stockholders from coercive or otherwise unfair takeover tactics by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with our board and by providing our board with more time to assess any acquisition proposal however these provisions apply even if the offer may be determined to be beneficial by some stockholders and could delay or prevent an acquisition that our board determines is not in our best interest and that of our stockholders 

furthermore banking laws impose notice approval and ongoing regulatory requirements on any stockholder or other party that seeks to acquire direct or indirect “control” of an fdicinsured depository institution these laws include the bank holding company act and the change in bank control act

management’s discussion and analysis 

key factors affecting our business 

macroeconomic conditions 

our business is affected by national and regional economic conditions as well as the perception of future conditions and economic prospects the significant macroeconomic factors that impact our business include interest rates the health of the housing market the rate of the us’s economic expansion and unemployment levels 

the us economy continued to expand at a moderate pace with real gdp rising by 24 in 2015 following 24  growth in 2014 growth in household spending has declined and the housing sector has slowed as well with the three month average of existing home sales falling to 52 million units from 55 million units in the previous quarter business fixed investment and net exports remained soft 

the labor market continued to improve with moderate job gains and declining unemployment the us unemployment rate dropped to 50  at december 31 2015  from 56  at december 31 2014  average monthly nonfarm employment increased by 228000  in 2015 after increasing a revised 251000  in 2014 

the frb maintained very accommodative monetary policy conditions during 2015 notwithstanding the small 25 bps rate increase in december and continues to target a 025  to 050  federal funds rate range at the short end of the yield curve interest rates remain relatively low see “—interest rates” below for further discussion of the impact of interest rates on our results observable inflation levels remain below the frb’s longerterm objective of 2  further labor market improvement and the dissipation of the effects of a decline in energy and import prices are expected to bring inflation closer to the frb’s inflation objective 

credit trends 

credit trends remained favorable in 2015  with a yearoveryear reduction in both net chargeoffs and nonperforming loans net chargeoffs in 2015  of 284 million  decreased 39 million  from 323 million  in 2014  driven by favorable credit conditions and higher recoveries annualized net chargeoffs as a percentage of total average loans improved to 030  in 2015  compared to 036  in 2014  asset quality remained strong and within expectations 

interest rates 

net interest income is our largest source of revenue and is the difference between the interest earned on interestearning assets usually loans and investment securities and the interest expense incurred in connection with interestbearing liabilities usually deposits and borrowings the level of net interest income is primarily a function of the average balance of interestearning assets the average balance of interestbearing liabilities and the spread between the contractual yield on such assets and the contractual cost of such liabilities these factors are influenced by the pricing and mix of interestearning assets and interestbearing liabilities which in turn are impacted by external factors such as local economic conditions competition for loans and deposits the monetary policy of the frb and market interest rates for further discussion refer to “—risk governance” and “—market risk — nontrading risk” 

the cost of our deposits and shortterm wholesale borrowings is largely based on shortterm interest rates which are primarily driven by the frb’s actions however the yields generated by our loans and securities are typically driven by both shortterm and longterm interest rates which are set by the market or at times by the frb’s actions the level of net interest income is therefore influenced by movements in such interest rates and the pace at which such movements occur in 2014 and 2015 shortterm and longterm interest rates remained at very low levels by historical standards with many benchmark rates such as the federal funds rate and one and threemonth libor near zero further declines in the yield curve or a decline in longerterm yields relative to shortterm yields a flatter yield curve would have an adverse impact on our net interest margin and net interest income 

in 2014 and 2015 the frb maintained a highly accommodative monetary policy and indicated that this policy would remain in effect for a considerable time after its asset purchase program ended on october 29 2014 and the economic recovery strengthens in the united states more recently the frb has started to move down the path of interest rate normalization by raising the federal funds rate by 25 basis points however the frb will likely continue to target a highly accommodative monetary policy for some time to come as of december 31 2015  the frb had ended its asset purchases of treasury securities and agency mortgagebacked securities however until further notice the frb will continue to reinvest run off from its 17 trillion  mortgagebacked portfolio

management’s discussion and analysis 

regulatory trends 

we are subject to extensive regulation and supervision which continue to evolve as the legal and regulatory framework governing our operations continues to change the current operating environment also has heightened regulatory expectations around many regulations including consumer compliance the bank secrecy act antimoney laundering compliance and increased internal audit activities as a result of these heightened expectations we expect to incur additional costs for additional compliance personnel andor professional fees associated with advisors and consultants 

doddfrank regulation 

as described under “regulation and supervision” in part i item 1 — business included elsewhere in this report we are subject to a variety of laws and regulations including the doddfrank act the doddfrank act is complex and many aspects of the doddfrank act are subject to final rulemaking or phased implementation that will take effect over several years the doddfrank act will continue to impact our earnings through fee reductions higher costs and imposition of new restrictions on us the doddfrank act may also continue to have a material adverse impact on the value of certain assets and liabilities held on our balance sheet the ultimate impact of the doddfrank act on our business will depend on regulatory interpretation and rulemaking as well as the success of any of our actions to mitigate the negative impacts of certain provisions key parts of the doddfrank act that specifically impact our business are the repeal of a previous prohibition against payment of interest on demand deposits which became effective in july 2011 and the introduction of a capital planning and stresstesting framework developed by the frbg known as ccar and dfast the dfast process projects net income loan losses and capital ratios during a ninequarter horizon under hypothetical stressful macroeconomic and financial market scenarios developed by the frbg as well as certain mandated assumptions about capital distributions prescribed in the dfast rule 

in march and july of 2015 we published estimated impacts of stress as required by applicable regulation processes which may be accessed on our regulatory filings and disclosures page on httpinvestorcitizensbankcom in 2016 we will publish the disclosure requirements in june and october consistent with the purpose of these exercises and the assumptions used to assess our performance during hypothetical economic conditions the projected results under the required stress scenarios show severe negative impacts on earnings however these pro forma results should not be interpreted to be management expectations in light of the current economic and operating environment during march 2015 the federal reserve also published results from the latest supervisory stress tests performed for and by large bank holding companies supervised by the federal reserve see frb website in 2016 the federal reserve is expected to publish results from the 2016 supervisory stress test performed for and by large bank holding companies supervised by the federal reserve in june these tests are conducted and published by the frb annually in fulfillment of ccar and dfast requirements 

comprehensive capital analysis and review 

ccar is an annual exercise by the frbg to ensure that the largest bank holding companies have sufficient capital to continue operations throughout times of economic and financial stress and robust forwardlooking capital planning processes that account for their unique risks 

as part of ccar the frbg evaluates institutions’ capital adequacy internal capital adequacy assessment processes and their plans to make capital distributions such as dividend payments or stock repurchases the frbg may either object to our capital plan in whole or in part or provide a notice of nonobjection if the frbg objects to our capital plan we may not make any capital distribution other than those with respect to which the frbg has indicated its nonobjection 

in march 2015 the frbg assessed our current capital plan as submitted and documented under the ccar process and raised no objection to the plan unless we choose to file an amended capital plan prior to april 2016 the maximum levels at which we may declare dividends and repurchase shares of our common stock through june 30 2016 are governed by our 2015 capital plan subject to actual financial performance and ongoing compliance with internal governance and all other regulatory requirements 

for subsequent cycles beginning in 2016 bhcs will be required to submit their annual capital plans and stress testing results to the federal reserve on or before april 5 

repeal of the prohibition on depository institutions paying interest on demand deposits 

we began offering interestbearing corporate checking accounts after the 2011 repeal of the prohibition on depository institutions paying interest on demand deposits currently industrywide interest rates for this product are very low and thus far the impact of the repeal has not had a significant effect on our results however market rates could increase more significantly in the future if we need to pay higher interest rates on checking accounts to maintain current clients or attract new clients our interest expense would increase perhaps materially furthermore if we fail to offer interest rates at a sufficient level to retain demand deposits our core deposits may be reduced which would require us to obtain funding in other ways or limit potential future asset growth

management’s discussion and analysis 

basel iii final rules applicable to us and our banking subsidiaries 

in july 2013 the frb occ and fdic issued the us basel iii final rules the rules implement the committee on banking supervision’s basel iii capital framework and certain provisions of the doddfrank act including the collins amendment the us basel iii final rules substantially revised the riskedbased capital and leverage requirements applicable to bank holding companies and their insured depository institution subsidiaries including cbna and cbpa the us basel iii final rules became effective for cfg and its depository institution subsidiaries including cbna and cbpa on january 1 2015 subject to a phasein period for certain provisions in order to comply with the new capital requirements we established internal capital ratio targets that meet or exceed us regulatory expectations under fully phasedin basel iii rules and increased our capital requirements in anticipation of the transition that is underway 

heloc payment shock 

attention has been given by regulators rating agencies and the general press regarding the potential for increased exposure to credit losses associated with helocs that were originated during the period of rapid home price appreciation between 2003 and 2007 industrywide many of the helocs originated during this timeframe were structured with an extended interestonly payment period followed by a requirement to convert to a higher payment amount that would begin fully amortizing both principal and interest beginning at a certain date in the future as of december 31 2015  approximately 29  of our 151 billion  heloc portfolio or 44 billion  in drawn balances were subject to a payment reset or balloon payment between january 1 2016 and december 31 2018 including 80 million  in balloon balances where full payment is due at the end of a tenyear interest only draw period 

to help manage this exposure in september 2013 we launched a comprehensive program designed to provide heightened customer outreach to inform educate and assist customers through the reset process as well as to offer alternative financing and forbearance options results indicate that our efforts to assist customers at risk of default have successfully reduced delinquency and chargeoff rates compared to our original expectations 

as of december 31 2015  for the 16 billion  of our heloc portfolio that was originally structured with a reset period in 2013 and 2014 94  of the balances were refinanced paid off or were current on payments 3  were past due and 3  had been charged off as of december 31 2015  for the 13 billion in balances originally structured with a reset period in 2015 94  of the balances were refinanced paid off or were current on payments 5  were past due and 1  had been charged off a total of 995 million  of these balances are scheduled to reset in 2016 factors that affect our future expectations for chargeoff risk for the portion of our heloc portfolio subject to reset periods in the future include improved loantovalue ratios resulting from continued home price appreciation stable portfolio credit score profiles and more robust loss mitigation efforts 

factors affecting comparability of our results 

goodwill 

during the 19year period from 1988 to 2007 we completed a series of more than 25 acquisitions of other financial institutions and financial assets and liabilities we accounted for these types of business combinations using the purchase method of accounting under this accounting method the acquired company’s net assets are recorded at fair value at the date of acquisition and the difference between the purchase price and the fair value of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill 

under relevant accounting guidance we are required to review goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that the fair value of any of our business units might be less than its carrying value the valuation of goodwill is dependent on forwardlooking expectations related to the performance of the us economy and our associated financial performance 

the prolonged delay in the full recovery of the us economy and the impact of that delay on our earnings expectations prompted us to record a 44 billion pretax 41 billion aftertax goodwill impairment as of june 30 2013 related to our consumer banking reporting unit for segment reporting purposes the impairment charge is reflected in other 

although the us economy had at the time demonstrated signs of recovery notably improvements in unemployment and housing the pace and extent of recovery in these indicators as well as in overall gross domestic product lagged behind previous expectations the impact of the slow recovery was most evident in consumer banking the forecasted lower economic growth for the united states coupled with increasing costs of complying with the new regulatory framework in the financial industry resulted in a deceleration of expected growth for consumer banking’s future income which resulted in our recording of a goodwill impairment charge during the second quarter of 2013 we have recorded goodwill impairment charges in the past most recently in 2013 and any further impairment to our goodwill could materially affect our results in any given period as of december 31 2015 and 2014 we had a carrying value of goodwill of 69 billion for additional information regarding our goodwill impairment testing see note 1 “significant accounting policies” and note 9 “goodwill” to our audited consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 — financial statements and supplementary data included elsewhere in this report

investment in our business 

we regularly incur expenses associated with investments in our infrastructure for example from 2010 to 2015 we invested 16 billion  in infrastructure and technology and plan to invest a total of 245 million  in 2016 and about 160 million  in 2017 we invested 219 million  in our infrastructure in 2015 these investments which are designed to lower our operating costs and improve our customer experience include significant programs to enhance our resiliency upgrade customerfacing technology and streamline operations recent significant investments included the 2013 launch of our new teller system new commercial loan platform and new auto loan platform and the 2013 upgrade of the majority of our atm network including equipping more than 1450  atms with advanced deposittaking functionality as well as additional investment in our treasury solutions platform in 2014 in the third quarter of 2015 we enhanced our data resiliency via a new back up data center and began rolling out a new mortgage platform we expect that these investments will increase our longterm overall efficiency and add to our capacity to increase revenue 

operating expenses to operate as a fully independent public company 

as part of our transition to a fully independent public company we incurred cumulative onetime expenditures of approximately 52 million  through the end of 2015 including capitalized costs of approximately 14 million  as well as ongoing incremental expenses of approximately 34 million  per year these ongoing costs include higher local charges associated with exiting worldwide vendor relationships and incremental expenses to support information technology compliance corporate governance regulatory financial and risk infrastructure that are necessary to enable us to operate as a fully independent public company 

principal components of operations and key performance metrics used by management 

as a banking institution we manage and evaluate various aspects of our results of operations and our financial condition we evaluate the levels and trends of the line items included in our balance sheet and statement of operations as well as various financial ratios that are commonly used in our industry we analyze these ratios and financial trends against our own historical performance our budgeted performance and the financial condition and performance of comparable banking institutions in our region and nationally 

the primary line items we use in our key performance metrics to manage and evaluate our statement of operations include net interest income noninterest income total revenue provision for credit losses noninterest expense and net income loss the primary line items we use in our key performance metrics to manage and evaluate our balance sheet data include loans and leases securities allowance for credit losses deposits borrowed funds and derivatives 

net interest income 

net interest income is the difference between the interest earned on interestearning assets usually loans and investment securities and the interest expense incurred in connection with interestbearing liabilities usually deposits and borrowings the level of net interest income is primarily a function of the average balance of interestearning assets the average balance of interestbearing liabilities and the spread between the contractual yield on such assets and the cost of such liabilities net interest income is impacted by the relative mix of interestearning assets and interestbearing liabilities movements in market interest rates levels of nonperforming assets and pricing pressure from competitors the mix of interestearning assets is influenced by loan demand and by management’s continual assessment of the rate of return and relative risk associated with various classes of interestearning assets 

the mix of interestbearing liabilities is influenced by management’s assessment of the need for lower cost funding sources weighed against relationships with customers and growth requirements and is impacted by competition for deposits in our market and the availability and pricing of other sources of funds 

noninterest income 

the primary components of our noninterest income are service charges and fees card fees trust and investment services fees and mortgage banking fees 

total revenue 

total revenue is the sum of our net interest income and our noninterest income 

provision for credit losses 

the provision for credit losses is the amount of expense that based on our judgment is required to maintain the allowance for credit losses at an amount that reflects probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date and that in management’s judgment is appropriate under relevant accounting guidance the provision for credit losses includes the provision for loan and lease losses as well as the provision for unfunded commitments the determination of the amount of the allowance for credit losses is complex and involves a high degree of judgment and subjectivity for additional information regarding the provision for credit losses see “—critical

noninterest expense 

noninterest expense includes salaries and employee benefits outside services occupancy expense equipment expense amortization of software goodwill impairment and other operating expenses 

net income loss 

we evaluate our net income loss based on measures including return on average common equity return on average total assets and return on average tangible common equity 

loans and leases 

we classify our loans and leases pursuant to the following classes commercial commercial real estate leases residential mortgages home equity loans home equity lines of credit home equity loans serviced by others home equity lines of credit serviced by others automobile student credit cards and other retail 

loans are reported at the amount of their outstanding principal net of chargeoffs unearned income deferred loan origination fees and costs and unamortized premiums or discounts on purchased loans deferred loan origination fees and costs and purchase discounts and premiums are amortized as an adjustment of yield over the life of the loan using the level yield interest method unamortized amounts remaining upon prepayment or sale are recorded as interest income or gain loss on sale respectively credit card receivables include billed and uncollected interest and fees 

leases are classified at the inception of the lease by type lease receivables including leveraged leases are reported at the aggregate of lease payments receivable and estimated residual values net of unearned and deferred income including unamortized investment credits lease residual values are reviewed at least annually for otherthantemporary impairment with valuation adjustments recognized currently against noninterest income leveraged leases are reported net of nonrecourse debt unearned income is recognized to yield a level rate of return on the net investment in the leases 

mortgage loans and commercial loans held for sale are carried at fair value 

securities 

our securities portfolio is managed to seek return while maintaining prudent levels of quality market risk and liquidity investments in debt and equity securities are carried in four portfolios afs htm trading securities and other investment securities we determine the appropriate classification at the time of purchase securities in our afs portfolio will be held for indefinite periods of time and may be sold in response to changes in interest rates changes in prepayment risk or other factors relevant to our asset and liability strategy securities in our afs portfolio are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported in oci as a separate component of stockholders’ equity net of taxes securities are classified as htm because we have the ability and intent to hold the securities to maturity and securities in our htm portfolio are carried at amortized cost other investment securities are composed mainly of fhlb stock and frb stock which are carried at cost and money market mutual fund investments held by the company’s brokerdealer which are carried at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in noninterest income 

allowance for credit losses 

our estimate of probable losses in the loan and lease portfolios is recorded in the alll and the reserve for unfunded lending commitments together these are referred to as the allowance for credit losses we evaluate the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses using the following ratios alll as a percentage of total loans and leases alll as a percentage of nonperforming loans and leases and nonperforming loans and leases as a percentage of total loans and leases for additional information see “—critical accounting estimates — allowance for credit losses” and note 1 “significant accounting policies” and note 5 “allowance for credit losses nonperforming assets and concentrations of credit risk” to our audited consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 — financial statements and supplementary data included elsewhere in this report

borrowed funds 

as of december 31 2015  our total shortterm borrowed funds included federal funds purchased securities sold under agreement to repurchase the current portion of fhlb advances and other shortterm borrowed funds as of december 31 2015  our longterm borrowed funds included subordinated debt unsecured notes federal home loan advances and other longterm borrowed funds for additional information see “—analysis of financial condition — borrowed funds” and note 12 “borrowed funds” to our audited consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 — financial statements and supplementary data included elsewhere in this report 

derivatives 

we use payfixed swaps to lengthen liabilities synthetically and offset duration in fixedrate assets we also use payfixed swaps to hedge floatingrate wholesale funding 

we use receivefixed interest rate swaps to manage the interest rate exposure on our medium term borrowings we also use receivefixed swaps to minimize the exposure to variability in the interest cash flows on our floating rate assets the assets and liabilities recorded for derivatives designated as hedges reflect the market value of these hedge instruments 

we sell interest rate swaps and foreign exchange forwards to commercial customers offsetting swap and forward agreements are simultaneously transacted to minimize our market risk associated with the customer derivative contracts the assets and liabilities recorded for derivatives not designated as hedges reflect the market value of these transactions for additional information see “—analysis of financial condition — derivatives” and note 16 “derivatives” to our audited consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 — financial statements and supplementary data included elsewhere in this report 

key performance metrics and nongaap financial measures 

we consider various measures when evaluating our performance and making daytoday operating decisions as well as evaluating capital utilization and adequacy including 

   

certain of the above financial measures including return on average tangible common equity return on average total tangible assets and the efficiency ratio are not recognized under gaap in addition we present net income loss net income loss available to common stockholders and return on average tangible common equityand efficiency ratio net of goodwill impairment restructuring charges and special items we believe these nongaap measures provide useful information to investors because these are among the measures used by our management team to evaluate our operating performance and make daytoday operating decisions in addition we believe restructuring charges and special items in any period do not reflect the operational performance of the business in that period and accordingly it is useful to consider these line items with and without restructuring charges and special items we believe this presentation also increases comparability of periodtoperiod results 

we consider pro forma capital ratios defined by banking regulators but not effective at each period end to be nongaap financial measures as analysts and banking regulators may evaluate our capital adequacy using these pro forma ratios we believe they are useful to provide investors the ability to evaluate our capital adequacy on the same basis 

other companies may use similarly titled nongaap financial measures that are calculated differently from the way we calculate such measures accordingly our nongaap financial measures may not be comparable to similar measures used by other companies we caution investors not to place undue reliance on such nongaap measures but instead to consider them with the most directly comparable gaap measure nongaap financial measures have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for our results reported under gaap

net interest income 

the following table shows the major components of net interest income and net interest margin 



1 our sbo portfolio consists of purchased home equity loans and lines that were originally serviced by others we now service a portion of this portfolio internally 

2 balances are net of certain shortterm receivables associated with reverse repurchase agreements interest expense includes the full cost of the repurchase agreements and certain hedging costs the rate on federal funds purchased is elevated due to the impact from payfixed interest rate swaps that are scheduled to run off by the end of 2016  see “—analysis of financial condition — december 31 2015  compared with december 31 2014  — derivatives” for further information

management’s discussion and analysis 

net interest income of  34 billion  in 2015 increased 101 million  or 3  compared to 33 billion  in 2014 as the benefit of earning asset growth and a reduction in payfixed swap costs was partially offset by continued pressure from the relatively persistent lowrate environment on loan yields and mix higher borrowing costs related to debt issuances and higher deposit costs 

average interestearning assets increased  68 billion  or 6  from 2014 due to a  39 billion  increase in average commercial loans and leases and a  32 billion  increase in average retail loans as growth in auto mortgage and student loan balances were partially offset by lower home equity outstandings and a reduction in the noncore loan portfolio 

 2015 net interest margin of 275  declined eight basis points compared to 283  in 2014 as the benefit of lower payfixed swap costs was more than offset by increased deposit costs higher senior and subordinated debt borrowing costs and a modest decrease in loan yields 2015 average interestearning asset yields of 312  declined two  basis points from 314  in 2014 reflecting the decline in the commercial loan and lease portfolio yields given the continued impact of the relatively persistent lowrate environment investment portfolio income of  621 million  in 2015 remained relatively stable compared to 619 million  in 2014 

  total interestbearing deposit costs of  237 million  in 2015 increased 81 million  or 52  from 156 million  in 2014  and reflected a nine  basis point increase in the rate paid on deposits to 033  from 024  the increase in deposit costs reflected a shift in mix to longer duration deposits largely term and money market products the cost of term deposits increased to 082   in 2015  from 065  in 2014  and money market accounts and savings accounts increased to 027  in 2015  from 019  in 2014  

total borrowed funds costs of 215 million  in 2015 increased modestly from 2014  within the federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase and other shortterm borrowed funds payfixed swap expense declined to 58 million  for 2015 compared to 99 million  in 2014  including the impact of hedging costs total borrowed funds rates increased to 156  from 151  in 2014  the increase in longterm borrowing expense of 50 million  was driven by an increase in senior and subordinated debt as we continued to realign our liability and capital structure to better align with peers 

noninterest income 

the following table details the significant components of our noninterest income 



1  includes net securities impairment losses on securities available for sale recognized in earnings and other income additionally noninterest income for the year ended december 31 2014 reflects a 288 million pretax gain related to the chicago divestiture 

noninterest income of 14 billion  in 2015 decreased   256 million  or 15  compared to 17 billion  in 2014 which included a 288 million pretax gain related to the chicago divestiture excluding the gain noninterest income increased 32 million service charges and fees card fees and trust and investment services fees remained relatively stable mortgage banking fees increased   30 million  reflecting the benefit of improved portfolio sales gains and higher origination volumes capital markets fees decreased   3 million  reflecting lower overall market conditions securities gains remained relatively stable other income excluding the impact of the 288 million pretax chicago gain recorded in the second quarter of 2014 increased 3 million  

provision for credit losses 

provision for credit losses of 302 million  in 2015 declined   17 million  from 319 million  in 2014 reflecting continued improvement in credit quality net chargeoffs for 2015 totaled 284 million  or 030  of average loans compared to 323 million  or 036  in 2014 the provision for credit losses includes the provision for loan and lease losses as well as the provision for unfunded commitments 

the provision for loan and lease losses is the result of a detailed analysis performed to estimate an appropriate and adequate alll the total provision for credit losses included the provision for loan and lease losses as well as the provision for unfunded commitments refer to “—analysis of financial condition — allowance for credit losses and nonperforming assets” for more information

noninterest expense 

the following table displays the significant components of our noninterest expense for the periods indicated 



  

noninterest expense of 33 billion  in 2015 declined   133 million  or 4  compared to 34 billion  2014 driven by a 119 million decrease in restructuring charges and special items excluding the impact of the restructuring charges and special items noninterest expense decreased 14 million driven by lower occupancy expense salaries and employee benefits and other operating expense partially offset by higher equipment amortization of software and outside services results reflected the impact of the chicago divestiture and investments to drive future growth offset by the benefit of efficiency initiatives 

provision for income taxes 

provision for income taxes of 423 million  decreased from 403 million  in 2014  respectively and reflected an effective tax rate of 335  which increased from 318  in 2014  the increase in the effective income tax rate related to the taxrate impact of combined reporting legislation nondeductible permanent expense items and the adoption of asu no 201401 “accounting for investments in qualified affordable housing projects” the application of this guidance resulted in the reclassification of the amortization of these investments to income tax expense from noninterest income furthermore these increases were partially offset by the tax rate impact of the gain on the chicago divestiture in the second quarter of 2014  

at december 31 2015  we reported a net deferred tax liability of 730 million  compared to a 493 million  liability at december 31 2014  the increase in the net deferred tax liability was primarily attributable to the increase in the deferred tax liability related to temporary differences of 261 million for further discussion see note 15 “income taxes” to our consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 — financial statements and supplementary data included elsewhere in this report

management’s discussion and analysis 

provision for credit losses is allocated to each business segment based on actual net chargeoffs that have been recognized by the business segment the difference between the consolidated provision for credit losses and the business segments’ net chargeoffs is reflected in other 

noninterest income and expense directly managed by each business segment including fees service charges salaries and benefits and other direct revenues and costs are accounted for within each segment’s financial results in a manner similar to our consolidated financial statements occupancy costs are allocated based on utilization of facilities by the business segment noninterest expenses incurred by centrally managed operations or business segments that directly support another business segment’s operations are charged to the applicable business segment based on its utilization of those services 

income taxes are assessed to each business segment at a standard tax rate with the residual tax expense or benefit to arrive at the consolidated effective tax rate included in other 

developing and applying methodologies used to allocate items among the business segments is a dynamic process accordingly financial results may be revised periodically as management systems are enhanced methods of evaluating performance or product lines change or our organizational structure changes

management’s discussion and analysis 

net interest income of 33 billion in 2014 increased 243 million or 8 from 31 billion in 2013 driven by growth in average interestearning assets a reduction in interest rate hedging costs as well as lower deposit costs these benefits were partially offset by the effect of declining loan yields and a continued shift in loan mix to lower yielding loans increased borrowing costs related to our issuance of subordinated debt and the effect of the chicago divestiture average interestearning assets of 1162 billion in 2014 increased 90 billion from 2013 driven by a 53 billion increase in the investment securities portfolio a 22 billion increase in commercial loans a 16 billion increase in residential mortgages and a 22 billion increase in automobile loans partially offset by a 20 billion decrease in home equity outstandings a 54 million reduction in student loans and a 267 million decrease in other retail loans 

 2014 net interest margin of 283 remained broadly stable compared to 285 in 2013 despite continued pressure from the relatively persistent low interestrate environment average interestearning asset yields continued to decline at a pace that exceeded our ability to reduce our cost of interestbearing deposits 2014 average interestearning asset yields of 314 declined 11 basis points from 325 in 2013 largely reflecting a 13 basis point decline in the loan and lease portfolio yield despite a five basis point improvement in the securities portfolio yield the decline in loan and lease yields was driven by the effect of a reduction in higheryielding consumer real estate secured outstandings in addition intense industrywide competition for commercial loans continued to compress spreads on new originations and resulted in additional downward pressure on overall loan yields investment portfolio income of 619 million for the year ended december 31 2014 increased 142 million or 30 compared to the year ended december 31 2013 

  total interestbearing deposit costs of 156 million in 2014 decreased 60 million or 28 from 216 million in 2013 and reflected an eight basis point decrease in the rate paid on deposits to 024 from 032 the cost of term deposits decreased to 065 in 2014 from 091 in 2013 while rates on money market and savings declined to 019 in 2014 from 025 in 2013 due to the historically low interest rate environment many deposit products have hit pricing floors at or near zero limiting further rate reduction and thus compressing margins 

the total borrowed funds costs of 203 million in 2014 declined 24 million or 11 from 227 million in 2013 driven by the benefit of a 101 million reduction in payfixed swap costs which was partially offset by an increase in longterm borrowed funds costs largely related to our issuance of subordinated debt 

total borrowed funds rates declined to 151 in 2014 from 653 in 2013 within the federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreement category and other shortterm borrowed funds categories payfixed swap expense declined to 99 million in 2014 from 200 million in 2013 excluding the impact of hedging costs 2014 borrowed funds costs were 078 compared to 116 in 2013

provision benefit for income taxes 

in 2014 we recorded income tax expense of 403 million compared to an income tax benefit of 42 million in 2013 the effective tax rates for the years ended december 31 2014 and 2013 were 318 and 12 respectively the increase in the effective rate largely reflected the tax rate impact of the goodwill impairment charge taken in 2013 goodwill not deductible for tax purposes accounted for 784 of the total goodwill impairment charge and generated a reduction of 351 in our effective tax rate for the year ended december 31 2013 

at december 31 2014 we reported a net deferred tax liability of 493 million compared to a 199 million liability at december 31 2013 the increase in the net deferred tax liability was attributable to the utilization of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards of 76 million which decreased the deferred tax asset a decrease in the tax effect on oci of 153 million which also decreased the deferred tax asset and an increase in the deferred tax liability related to temporary differences of 65 million for further discussion see note 15 “income taxes” to our audited consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 — financial statements and supplementary data included elsewhere in this report

management’s discussion and analysis 

provision for credit losses is allocated to each business segment based on actual net chargeoffs that have been recognized by the business segment the difference between the consolidated provision for credit losses and the business segments’ net chargeoffs is reflected in other 

noninterest income and expense directly managed by each business segment including fees service charges salaries and benefits and other direct revenues and costs are accounted for within each segment’s financial results in a manner similar to our audited consolidated financial statements occupancy costs are allocated based on utilization of facilities by the business segment generally operating losses are charged to the business segment when the loss event is realized in a manner similar to a loan chargeoff noninterest expenses incurred by centrally managed operations or business segments that directly support another business segment’s operations are charged to the applicable business segment based on its utilization of those services 

income taxes are assessed to each business segment at a standard tax rate with the residual tax expense or benefit to arrive at the consolidated effective tax rate included in other 

developing and applying methodologies used to allocate items among the business segments is a dynamic process accordingly financial results may be revised periodically as management systems are enhanced methods of evaluating performance or product lines change or our organizational structure changes

consumer banking segment net income of 182 million in 2014 decreased 60 million or 25 from 242 million in 2013 as the benefit of a reduction in provision for credit losses was more than offset by lower revenue driven by overall mortgage banking headwinds and lower service charges and fee income 

total revenue was 31 billion in 2014 down 151 million or 5 from 32 billion in 2013 net interest income of 22 billion in 2014 remained broadly stable with the prior year as the benefit of lower deposit costs and loan growth was more than offset by the effect of the relatively persistent lowrate environment and the chicago divestiture loan growth reflected higher residential mortgage and auto loan outstandings partially offset by lower home equity outstandings noninterest income of 899 million decreased 126 million or 12 from 10 billion in 2013 driven by lower mortgage banking fees service charges and fees and the impact of the chicago divestiture partially offset by growth in trust and investment services fees and a gain on sale of discontinued student loan portfolio

management’s discussion and analysis 

mortgage banking fees of 71 million in 2014 decreased 82 million driven by overall lower origination volume and the decision to hold more loans onbalance sheet mortgage banking fees were also negatively impacted by a reduction in the recovery of mortgage servicing rights valuations from the prior year service charges and fees of 416 million decreased 58 million or 12 from 2013 driven by the impact of a change in checkposting order as well as the chicago divestiture results also reflected the benefit of growth in trust and investment services fees as well as a 9 million gain on sale of student loans 

noninterest expense of 25 billion in 2014 remained relatively stable with the prior year as the benefit of our efficiency initiatives and the impact of the chicago divestiture were offset by continued investment in the business to drive future growth 

provision for credit losses of 259 million in 2014 decreased 49 million or 16 from 308 million in 2013 reflecting improved credit quality

commercial banking net income of 561 million in 2014 increased 47 million or 9 from 514 million in 2013 driven by an 82 million increase in total revenue partially offset by higher expenses and slightly lower credit net recoveries 

net interest income of 11 billion in 2014 increased 42 million or 4 from 10 billion in 2013 largely due to a 30 billion increase in interestearning assets and a 23 billion increase in customer deposits which was partially offset by continued downward pressure on loan yields given the relatively persistent lowrate environment and increased industrywide competition 

noninterest income of 429 million in 2014 increased 40 million or 10 from 389 million in 2013 as a 51 million increase in leasing income and capital markets fees was partially offset by lower interest rate product foreign exchange and trade finance fees

other recorded net income of 122 million in 2014 compared with a net loss of 42 billion in 2013 which included an aftertax goodwill impairment charge of 41 billion excluding the goodwill impairment the net loss in 2013 was 102 million net income in 2014 included a 180 million aftertax gain related to the chicago divestiture partially offset by 105 million of aftertax restructuring charges and special items net loss in 2013 also included 17 million of aftertax restructuring charges and special items excluding these items net income increased 132 million driven by higher net interest income as well as lower provision for credit losses partially offset by lower noninterest income 

  

net interest income in 2014 increased 226 million to 77 million compared to an expense of 149 million in 2013 the increase was driven by the benefit of a 51 billion increase in average investment securities a reduction in interest rate swap costs and an increase in residual net interest income related to funds transfer pricing partially offset by higher wholesale funding costs and a 13 billion decrease in average noncore loan balances 

noninterest income in 2014 increased 132 million driven by the 288 million pretax gain on the chicago divestiture excluding the gain noninterest income decreased 156 million driven by a 116 million reduction in securities gains and higher net losses on lowincome housing investments which are more than offset by increased tax credits 

noninterest expense in 2014 of 227 million included 169 million of pretax restructuring charges and special items and decreased 43 billion from 2013 which included the 44 billion pretax goodwill impairment charge and 26 million of pretax restructuring charges and special items excluding the goodwill impairment restructuring charges and special items noninterest expense decreased 3 million largely reflecting lower costs related to the noncore loan portfolio largely offset by higher employee incentive costs for further information about these special items including expected additional future costs see note 22 “exit costs and restructuring reserves” to our audited consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 — financial statements and supplementary data included elsewhere in this report 

the provision for credit losses within other mainly represents the residual change in the consolidated allowance for credit losses after attributing the respective net chargeoffs to the consumer banking and commercial banking segments it also includes net chargeoffs related to the noncore portfolio the provision for credit losses in 2014 decreased 112 million to 66 million compared to 178 million in 2013 reflecting continued improvement in credit quality and decreased noncore net chargeoffs of 128 million on a quarterly basis we review and refine our estimate of the allowance for credit losses taking into consideration changes in portfolio size and composition historical loss experience internal risk ratings current economic conditions industry performance trends and other pertinent information in 2014 changes in these factors led to a net release of 4 million in the allowance for credit losses compared with a net release of 22 million in 2013 the provision also reflected an increase in overall credit exposure associated with growth in our loan portfolio

 noncore assets   

the table below shows the composition of our noncore assets as of the dates indicated 



1 our sbo portfolio consists of purchased home equity loans and lines that were originally serviced by others we now service a portion of this portfolio internally 

noncore assets are primarily loans inconsistent with our strategic goals generally as a result of geographic location industry product type or risk level noncore assets totaled 23 billion  as of december 31 2015  we have actively managed these loans down since they were designated as noncore on june 30 2009 between that time and december 31 2015  the portfolio decreased 181 billion  including principal repayments of 101 billion  chargeoffs of 39 billion  transfers back to the core portfolio of 28 billion  and sales of 13 billion  transfers from noncore back to core were handled on an individualrequest basis and managed through our chief credit officer 

noncore assets totaled 23 billion  as of december 31 2015  down   25  from december 31 2014  driven by principal repayments of 696 million  commercial noncore loan balances declined   41  compared to december 31 2014  ending at 168 million  compared to 284 million  at december 31 2014  retail noncore loan balances of 21 billion   decreased   607 million  or 22  compared to december 31 2014  

the largest component of our noncore portfolio is the home equity sbo portfolio the sbo portfolio is a liquidating portfolio consisting of pools of home equity loans and lines of credit purchased between 2003 and 2007 although our sbo portfolio consists of loans that were initially serviced by others we now service a portion of this portfolio internally sbo balances serviced externally totaled 763 million  and 11 billion  as of december 31 2015  and 2014  respectively the sbo portfolio has been closed to new purchases since the third quarter of 2007 with exposure down to 14 billion  as of december 31 2015  compared to 18 billion  as of december 31 2014  the sbo portfolio represented 4  of the retail real estate secured portfolio and 3  of the overall retail loan portfolio as of december 31 2015  

the credit profile of the sbo portfolio was weaker than the core real estate portfolio with a weightedaverage refreshed fico score of 712  and cltv of 90  as of december 31 2015  the proportion of the portfolio in a second lien subordinated position was 96  with 72  of the portfolio in outoffootprint geographies including 28  in california nevada arizona and florida

allowance for credit losses and nonperforming assets 

we and our banking subsidiaries cbna and cbpa maintain an allowance for credit losses consisting of an alll and a reserve for unfunded lending commitments this allowance is created through charges to income or provision for credit losses and is maintained at an appropriate level adequate to absorb anticipated losses and is determined in accordance with gaap for further information on our processes to determine our allowance for credit losses see “—critical accounting estimates — allowance for credit losses” note 1 “significant accounting policies” and note 5 “allowance for credit losses nonperforming assets and concentrations of credit risk” to our audited consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 — financial statements and supplementary data included elsewhere in this report 

the allowance for credit losses totaled 13 billion  at december 31 2015  and 2014  respectively our alll was 123  of total loans and leases and 115  of nonperforming loans and leases as of december 31 2015  compared with 128  and 109  as of december 31 2014  

overall loan portfolio credit quality continued to improve across many measures in the year ended   december 31 2015  however as expected the rate of improvement began to level off in the second half of 2015 as credit trends continued to normalize from lower levels as such we expect asset quality trends to continue to normalize in the future net chargeoffs for the year ended   december 31 2015  of 284 million  decreased 12  compared to 323 million  for the year ended   december 31 2014  the portfolio annualized net chargeoff rate declined to 030  for the year ended   december 31 2015  from 036  for the year ended   december 31 2014  the 90 day or more past due delinquency rate was 09  as of december 31 2015  and 2014  nonperforming loans and leases totaled 11 billion  or 107  of the total portfolio as of december 31 2015  and 11 billion  or 118  in december 31 2014  at december 31 2015  742 million  of nonperforming loans and leases had been designated as impaired and had no specific alll because they had been written down to the fair value of their collateral these impaired loans included 672 million  of retail loans and 70 million  of commercial loans 

commercial loan asset quality 

our commercial loan and lease portfolio consists of traditional commercial loans commercial real estate loans and leases the portfolio is predominantly focused on customers in our footprint where our local delivery model provides for strong client connectivity however we also do business in certain specialized industry sectors on a national basis 

for commercial loans and leases we use regulatory classification ratings to monitor credit quality loans with a “pass” rating are those that we believe will be fully repaid in accordance with the contractual loan terms commercial loans and leases that are “criticized” are those that have some weakness that indicates an increased probability of future loss see note 5 “allowance for credit losses nonperforming assets and concentrations of credit risk” to our audited consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 — financial statements and supplementary data included elsewhere in this report 

as of december 31 2015  nonperforming commercial loans and leases decreased 16 million  or 10  to 148 million  compared to 164 million  as of december 31 2014  driven by a 38  decline in commercial nonperforming loans as of december 31 2015  total commercial nonperforming loans stood at 03  of the commercial loan portfolio compared to 04  as of december 31 2014  net chargeoffs in our total commercial loan and lease portfolio for the year ended   december 31 2015  reflected a net recovery of 13 million  compared to a net recovery of 15 million  for the year ended   december 31 2014  see “—key factors affecting our business — credit trends” for further details 

notwithstanding the improvement in nonperforming loans and leases during the year ended december 31 2015  total criticized loans and leases in the total commercial loan and lease portfolio including commercial real estate loans increased to 26 billion  or 56  of the portfolio compared to 19 billion  or 45  at december 31 2014  commercial loan criticized balances increased to 20 billion or 60 of the commercial loan portfolio compared to 14 billion or 45 as of december 31 2014  driven by a 331 million increase in the oil and gas industry portfolio with most of the commercial loan criticized balance increase occurring in fourth quarter 2015 commercial real estate criticized balances increased to 521 million  or 58  of the commercial real estate portfolio compared to 455 million  or 58  as of december 31 2014  commercial loans accounted for 76 of criticized loans as of december 31 2015  compared to 73 as of december 31 2014  commercial real estate accounted for 20  of criticized loans as of december 31 2015  compared to 24  as of december 31 2014  

retail loan asset quality 

for retail loans we primarily use the loan’s payment and delinquency status to monitor credit quality the longer a loan is past due the greater the likelihood of future credit loss these credit quality indicators are continually updated and monitored our retail loan portfolio remains focused on lending across the new england midatlantic and midwest regions with continued geographic expansion outside the footprint primarily in the auto finance and student lending portfolios retail assets increased to 528 billion  as of december 31 2015  a 5  increase from december 31 2014  driven by growth in the student lending residential mortgage and auto finance portfolio offset by a reduction in home equity balances including run off in the noncore portfolio 

citizens financial group inc 

management’s discussion and analysis 

the credit composition of our retail loan portfolio at december 31 2015  remained favorable and wellpositioned across all product lines with an average refreshed fico score of 757  an improvement of 2 points from december 31 2014  our real estate cltv ratio is calculated as the mortgage and second lien loan balance divided by the appraised value of the property and was 636  as of december 31 2015  compared to 654  as of december 31 2014  excluding the sbo portfolio the real estate cltv was 623  as of december 31 2015  compared to 638  as of december 31 2014  asset quality is improving with a net chargeoff rate core and noncore of 058  for the year ended   december 31 2015  a decrease of 12  basis points from the year ended   december 31 2014  

nonperforming retail loans as a percentage of total retail loans were 17  as of december 31 2015  a 14  basis point decrease from december 31 2014  retail nonaccrual loans of 904 million  at december 31 2015  decreased 26 million  from 930 million  at december 31 2014  reflecting lower mortgage and home equity portfolios partially offset by increases in the student lending and auto finance portfolios

troubled debt restructuring 

tdr is the classification given to a loan that has been restructured in a manner that grants a concession that we would not otherwise make to a borrower that is experiencing financial hardship tdrs typically result from our loss mitigation efforts and are undertaken in order to improve the likelihood of recovery and continuity of the relationship our loan modifications are handled on a case by case basis and are negotiated to achieve mutually agreeable terms that maximize loan collectability and meet our borrower’s financial needs the types of concessions include interest rate reductions term extensions principal forgiveness and other modifications to the structure of the loan that fall outside our lending policy depending on the specific facts and circumstances of the customer restructuring can involve loans moving to nonaccrual remaining on nonaccrual or continuing on accrual status   as of december 31 2015  and 2014  we classified 12 billion  as retail tdrs in the retail tdr population 379 million  were in nonaccrual status of which 51  were current in payment tdrs generally return to accrual status once repayment capacity and appropriate payment history can be established tdrs are evaluated for impairment individually loans are classified as tdrs until paid off sold or refinanced at market terms

on december 3 2015 we repurchased 750 million  of outstanding subordinated debt instruments held by rbs the 3 million  difference between the repurchase price and the net carrying amount of the subordinated debt was recognized as a gain on extinguishment of the debt to fund the repurchase we issued 750 million  of new subordinated debt with a 4300  fixed rate and a ten year maturity 

longterm borrowed funds of 99 billion  as of december 31 2015   increased   52 billion  from december 31 2014  primarily driven by a 42 billion  increase in long term fhlb advances a 750 million  increase in senior bank debt and a 250 million  increase in subordinated debt used to fund the august 3 2015 repurchase of 9615384 shares of our common stock

we use receivefixed swaps to minimize the exposure to variability in the interest cash flows on our floating rate assets at december 31 2015  and 2014  the notional amount of receivefixed swap hedges of floatingrate loans totaled 85 billion  and 40 billion  respectively and the fixedrate ranges were 077  to 204  and 178  to 204  respectively we paid onemonth libor on these swaps 

in december 2015 we entered into 

 in november 2015 we entered into a 750 million receivefixed interestrate swap agreement to manage the interest rate exposure on our threeyear medium term fixedrate debt issued in november 2015 this agreement converted the 230 fixedrate debt coupon to threemonth libor we receive a fixed rate of 124 on the swap agreement and pay threemonth libor 

in may 2015 we entered into a 750 million receivefixed interestrate swap agreement to manage the interest rate exposure on our threeyear medium term fixedrate debt issued in december 2014 this agreement converted the 160 fixedrate debt coupon to threemonth libor plus 49 basis points we receive a fixed rate of 111 on the swap agreement and pay threemonth libor 

in december 2014 we entered into a 750 million receivefixed interestrate swap agreement to manage the interest rate exposure on our fiveyear medium term fixedrate debt issued in december 2014 this agreement converted the 245 fixedrate debt coupon to threemonth libor plus 79 basis points we receive a fixed rate of 166 on the swap agreement and pay threemonth libor

management’s discussion and analysis 

the table below presents our derivative assets and liabilities for additional information regarding our derivative instruments see note 16 “derivatives” in our audited consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 — financial statements and supplementary data included elsewhere in this report 



1 the notional or contractual amount of interest rate derivatives and foreign exchange contracts is the amount upon which interest and other payments under the contract are based for interest rate derivatives the notional amount is typically not exchanged therefore notional amounts should not be taken as the measure of credit or market risk as they tend to greatly overstate the true economic risk of these contracts 

2 amounts represent the impact of legally enforceable master netting agreements that allow us to settle positive and negative positions 

3 we also offset assets and liabilities associated with repurchase agreements on our consolidated balance sheets see note 3 “securities” in our audited consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 — financial statements and supplementary data included elsewhere in this report 

at december 31 2015  the overall derivative asset value decreased 4 million  and the liability balance decreased by 127 million  from december 31 2014  primarily due to decreased fixed interest rates at december 31 2015  compared to december 31 2014  and increased notional balances for the same period

capital 

as a bank holding company and a financial holding company we are subject to regulation and supervision by the frbg our primary subsidiaries are our two insured depository institutions cbna a national banking association whose primary federal regulator is the occ and cbpa a pennsylvaniacharted savings bank regulated by the department of banking of the commonwealth of pennsylvania and supervised by the fdic as its primary federal regulator 

in july 2013 the frb occ and fdic issued the us basel iii final rules the rules implement the basel committee on banking supervision’s basel iii capital framework and certain provisions of the doddfrank act including the collins amendment the us basel iii final rules substantially revised the riskbased capital and leverage requirements applicable to bank holding companies and their insured depository institution subsidiaries including cbna and cbpa the us basel iii final rules became effective for cfg and its depository institution subsidiaries including cbna and cbpa on january 1 2015 subject to a phasein period for certain provisions 

the us basel iii final rules among other things i introduced a new capital measure called cet1 ii specified that tier 1 capital consists of cet1 and “additional tier 1 capital” instruments meeting certain revised requirements iii defined cet1 narrowly by requiring that most deductionsadjustments to regulatory capital measures be made to cet1 and not to the other components of capital and iv expanded the scope of the deductions adjustments to capital as compared to existing regulations under the us basel iii final rules the minimum capital ratios effective as of january 1 2015 are 

 the us basel iii final rules also introduced a new “capital conservation buffer” composed entirely of cet1 on top of these minimum riskweighted asset ratios the implementation of the capital conservation buffer began on january 1 2016 at the 0625 level and will increase by 0625 on each subsequent january 1 until it reaches 25 on january 1 2019 banking institutions with a ratio of cet1 to riskweighted assets below the effective minimum 45 plus the capital conservation buffer and if applicable the countercyclical capital buffer will face constraints on dividends equity repurchases and compensation based on the amount of the shortfall 

when fully phased in on january 1 2019 the us basel iii final rules will require cfg cbna and cbpa to maintain an additional capital conservation buffer of 25 of cet1 effectively resulting in minimum ratios of i cet1 to riskweighted assets of at least 7 ii tier 1 capital to riskweighted assets of at least 85 iii a minimum ratio of total capital to riskweighted assets of at least 105 and iv a minimum leverage ratio of 4 

the us basel iii final rules also provide for a number of deductions from and adjustments to cet1 these include for example the requirement that certain deferred tax assets and significant investments in nonconsolidated financial entities be deducted from cet1 to the extent that any one such category exceeds 10 of cet1 or all such items in the aggregate exceed 15 of cet1 implementation of the deductions and other adjustments to cet1 began on january 1 2015 and will be phasedin over a 4year period beginning at 40 on january 1 2015 and an additional 20 per year thereafter 

the us basel iii final rules prescribe a standardized approach for risk weightings that expanded the riskweighting categories from the general riskbased capital rules to a much larger and more risksensitive number of categories depending on the nature of the assets generally ranging from 0 for us government and agency securities to 600 for certain equity exposures and resulting in higher risk weights for a variety of asset categories 

with respect to cbna and cbpa the us basel iii final rules also revise the “prompt corrective action” regulations pursuant to section 38 of the federal deposit insurance act as discussed above in “federal deposit insurance act”

standardized approach 

the basel iii standardized approach measures riskweighted assets primarily for market risk and credit risk exposures exposures subject to market risk are measured on a basis generally consistent with how market riskweighted assets were measured using the market risk rules as defined under the basel 25 refer to “—market risk — market risk regulatory capital” for further information cfg applies the basel iii standardized approach as defined by the us regulators for determining the assignment of riskweighted assets under the standardized approach which is the riskweight methodology applicable to cfg no distinction is made for variations in credit quality for corporate exposures additionally the economic benefit of collateral is restricted to a limited list of eligible securities and cash we estimate our common equity tier 1 capital ratio under the basel iii standardized approach on a fully phasedin basis to be 117  at december 31 2015  as of december 31 2015  we estimated that our basel iii standardized common equity tier 1 capital would be 134 billion  and total riskweighted assets would be 1143 billion  on a fullyphased in basis our estimates under the basel iii standardized approach may be refined over time because of further rulemaking or clarification by us banking regulators or as our understanding and interpretation of the rules evolve actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions

management’s discussion and analysis 

cet1 capital under basel iii standardized transitional rules was 134 billion  at december 31 2015  an increase of 216 million  from tier 1 common equity under basel i at december 31 2014  the increase was primarily attributable to net income for year ended   december 31 2015  net of dividends paid to stockholders 500 million in aggregate repurchases of common shares executed on april 7 2015 and august 3 2015 and amortization of deferred tax related to goodwill at december 31 2015  there was approximately 247 million of additional tier 1 capital reflecting the capital value after issuance costs of the 5500 fixedtofloating noncumulative perpetual preferred stock series a issued on april 6 2015 tier 1 capital at december 31 2015  was 136 billion  an increase of  463 million  over the year as approximately half of the repurchase of common shares was offset by the issuance of preferred shares total capital was 175 billion  at december 31 2015  an increase of 724 million  from december 31 2014  driven primarily by net income net of dividends paid to stockholders as the combined impact of the repurchase of common shares issuance of preferred shares and issuance of 250 million in subordinated debt on july 31 2015 was generally neutral to total capital 

on january 1 2015  we began reporting riskweighted assets based on basel iii standardized transitional rules the conversion from basel i rules resulted in a 27 billion  increase in rwas as of december 31 2014  this increase was primarily driven by risk weight changes for securitization offbalance sheet commitments with original maturity one year or less past due and nonaccruals and the removal of the cap on otc derivatives 

riskweighted assets based on basel iii standardized transitional rules at december 31 2015  were 1141 billion  an increase of 81 billion  as compared to december 31 2014  the primary drivers for this change were the adoption of the basel iii standardized approach as well as growth in commercial consumer auto and student loan exposures 

as of december 31 2015  the tier 1 leverage ratio decreased approximately 13  basis points this decline reflected the net impact of a 59 billion  increase in adjusted quarterly average total assets which drove a 49  basis point decline in the ratio and the previously noted increase in tier 1 capital which added 36  basis points to the ratio 

the following table presents our capital composition under the basel iii capital framework in effect for us at december 31 2015  and under the basel i capital framework in effect for us at december 31 2014

capital adequacy process 

our assessment of capital adequacy begins with our risk appetite and risk management framework this framework provides for the identification measurement and management of material risks capital requirements are determined for actual 

citizens financial group inc 

management’s discussion and analysis 

and forecasted risk portfolios using applicable regulatory capital methodologies the assessment also considers the possible impacts of approved and proposed regulatory changes that will or may apply to future periods key analytical frameworks which enable the comprehensive assessment of capital adequacy versus unexpected loss supplement our base case forecast these supplemental frameworks include integrated stress testing as well as an internal capital adequacy requirement that builds on internally assessed economic capital requirements a robust governance framework supports our capital planning process this process includes capital management policies and procedures that document capital adequacy metrics and limits as well as our comprehensive capital contingency plan and the active engagement of both the legalentity boards and senior management in oversight and decisionmaking 

forwardlooking assessments of capital adequacy for us and for our banking subsidiaries feed development of capital plans that are submitted to the frbg and other bank regulators we prepare these plans in full compliance with the frbg’s capital plan rule and we participate annually in the frbg’s extensive ccar review process in addition to the stress test requirements under ccar we also participate in semiannual stress tests required by the doddfrank act 

in march 2015 the frbg assessed our current capital plan in response to the ccar process and issued a notice of nonobjection unless we choose to file an amended capital plan prior to april 2016 the maximum levels at which we may declare dividends and repurchase shares of our common stock through june 30 2016 are governed by the proposed capital actions and are subject to actual financial performance as well as ongoing compliance with internal governance and all other regulatory requirements 

capital transactions 

during the year ended december 31 2015  we completed the following capital actions 

 the direct repurchase of subordinated debt from rbs and the public issuance of subordinated debt during the fourth quarter of 2015 were generally neutral to our total capital level and ratios the repurchase of common shares and the issuance of subordinated debt during the third quarter of 2015 were neutral to our total capital level and ratios but reduced common equity by 250 million and the cet1 and tier 1 riskbased ratios by 22 basis points the repurchase of common shares and the issuance of preferred shares during the second quarter of 2015 were generally neutral to our tier 1 and total capital levels and ratios but reduced common equity by 250 million and the cet1 ratio by approximately 23 basis points 

we intend to continue to repurchase common stock and subordinated debt as appropriate subject to regulatory approval and market conditions 

at december 31 2015  all regulatory ratios remained well above their respective fully phasedin basel iii minimum which includes the capital conservation buffer for the riskbased ratios fully phasedin regulatory ratios are nongaap financial measures for more information on computation of these nongaap financial measures see “—principal components of

cbna cet1 capital under basel iii standardized transitional rules was 108 billion  at december 31 2015  an increase of 348 million  from tier 1 common equity under basel i at december 31 2014  the increase was primarily attributable to net income for the year ended   december 31 2015  net of dividends paid to cfg at december 31 2015  cbna held minimal additional tier 1 capital total capital was 131 billion  at december 31 2015  an increase of 548 million  driven primarily by the increase in cet1 capital 

on january 1 2015  cbna began reporting riskweighted assets based on basel iii standardized transitional rules the conversion from basel i rules resulted in a 20 billion  increase in rwas as of december 31 2014  this increase was primarily driven by risk weight changes for securitizations commercial past due and nonaccruals offbalance sheet commitments with an original maturity one year or less and the removal of the cap on otc derivatives 

cbna riskweighted assets based on basel iii standardized transitional rules at december 31 2015  were 916 billion  an increase of 63 billion  as compared to december 31 2014  the primary drivers for this change were the adoption of the basel iii standardized approach as well as growth in commercial student and consumer auto loan exposures these increases were partially offset by run off in home lending exposures 

as of december 31 2015  the cbna tier 1 leverage ratio decreased approximately 18  basis points driven by an increase in adjusted quarterly average total assets of 49 billion  resulting in a 54  basis point decline in the ratio partially offset by a 36  basis point increase for higher cet1 capital described above 

cbpa cet1 capital under basel iii standardized transitional rules was 30 billion  at december 31 2015  an increase of 50 million  from tier 1 common equity under basel i at december 31 2014  the increase was primarily attributable to amortization of deferred tax related to goodwill as net income for the year ended   december 31 2015  net of dividends paid to cfg was flat compared to 2014 at december 31 2015  there was no additional tier 1 capital total capital was 36 billion  at december 31 2015  an increase of 65 million  driven primarily by the increase in cet1 capital and a slight increase in allowance for credit losses

on january 1 2015  cbpa began reporting riskweighted assets based on basel iii standardized transitional rules the conversion from basel i rules resulted in a 705 million  increase in rwas as of december 31 2014  this increase was primarily driven by riskweight changes for offbalance sheet commitments with an original maturity one year or less securitizations and the removal of the cap on otc derivatives 

cbpa riskweighted assets based on basel iii standardized transitional rules at december 31 2015  were 232 billion  an increase of 21 billion  as compared to december 31 2014  the primary drivers for this change were the adoption of the basel iii standardized approach as well as growth in commercial student loans and purchased auto loan exposures 

as of december 31 2015  the cbpa tier 1 leverage ratio decreased approximately 37  basis points driven by an increase in adjusted quarterly average total assets of 18 billion  resulting in a 52  basis point decline in the ratio partially offset by a 15  basis point increase resulting from higher cet1 capital described above 

liquidity 

we define liquidity as an institution’s ability to meet its cashflow and collateral obligations in a timely manner at a reasonable cost an institution must maintain current liquidity to fund its daily operations and forecasted cashflow needs as well as contingent liquidity to deliver funding in a stress scenario we consider the effective and prudent management of liquidity to be fundamental to our health and strength 

we manage liquidity at the consolidated enterprise level and at each material legal entity including us cbna and cbpa 

cfg liquidity 

our primary sources of cash are i dividends and interest received from our banking subsidiaries as a result of investing in bank equity and subordinated debt and ii externally issued subordinated debt our uses of liquidity include the following i routine cash flow requirements as a bank holding company including payments of dividends interest and expenses ii needs of subsidiaries including our banking subsidiaries for additional equity and as required their needs for debt financing and iii extraordinary requirements for cash 

on july 31 2015 we issued 250 million aggregate principal amount 4350 subordinated notes due 2025 in a public underwritten offering we used the net proceeds of this offering to repurchase 9615384 shares of our outstanding common stock directly from rbs at 2600 per share 

our cash and cash equivalents represent a source of liquidity that can be used to meet various needs as of december 31 2015  we held cash and cash equivalents of approximately 400 million  which should be viewed as a liquidity reserve 

our liquidity risk is low for the following reasons i we have no material nonbanking subsidiaries and our banking subsidiaries are selffunding ii we have no outstanding senior debt at the cfg level iii the capital structures of our banking subsidiaries are similar to our capital structure as of december 31 2015  our double leverage ratio the combined equity of our subsidiaries divided by our equity was 1014  and iv our other cash flow requirements such as operating expenses are relatively small 

banking subsidiaries’ liquidity 

in the ordinary course of business the liquidity of cbna and cbpa is managed by matching sources and uses of cash the primary sources of bank liquidity include i deposits from our consumer and commercial franchise customers ii payments of principal and interest on loans and debt securities and iii wholesale borrowings as needed and as described under “—liquidity risk management and governance” the primary uses of bank liquidity include i withdrawals and maturities of deposits ii payment of interest on deposits iii funding of loan commitments and iv funding of securities purchases to the extent that the banks have relied on wholesale borrowings uses also include payments of related principal and interest 

our banking subsidiaries’ major businesses involve taking deposits and making loans hence a key role of liquidity management is to ensure that customers have timely access to funds from deposits and loans liquidity management also involves maintaining sufficient liquidity to repay wholesale borrowings pay operating expenses and support extraordinary funding requirements when necessary 

from an external issuance perspective during 2014 we created a 30 billion global note program for cbna on december 3 2015 cbna issued 750 million in threeyear fixedrate senior notes under this program this debt represents a key source of unsecured term and stable funding further diversifies the funding sources of cbna and creates a more peerlike funding structure for the consolidated enterprise additionally on december 1 2014 cbna issued 15 billion in senior notes under this program consisting of 750 million of threeyear fixedrate notes and 750 million in fiveyear fixedrate notes

management’s discussion and analysis 

liquidity risk 

we define liquidity risk as the risk that an entity will be unable to meet our payment obligations in a timely manner we manage liquidity risk at the consolidated enterprise level and for each material legal entity including us cbna and cbpa liquidity risk can arise due to contingent liquidity risk andor funding liquidity risk 

contingent liquidity risk is the risk that market conditions may reduce an entity’s ability to liquidate pledge andor finance certain assets and thereby substantially reduce the liquidity value of such assets drivers of contingent liquidity risk include general market disruptions as well as specific issues regarding the credit quality andor valuation of a security or loan issuer or borrower andor asset class 

funding liquidity risk is the risk that market conditions andor entityspecific events may reduce an entity’s ability to raise funds from depositors andor wholesale market counterparties drivers of funding liquidity risk may be idiosyncratic or systemic reflecting impediments to operations andor undermining of market confidence 

factors affecting liquidity 

given the composition of their assets and borrowing sources contingent liquidity at both cbna and cbpa would be materially affected by such events as deterioration of financing markets for highquality securities eg mortgagebacked securities and other instruments issued by the gnma fnma and the fhlmc by any inability of the fhlbs to provide collateralized advances andor by a refusal of the frb to act as lender of last resort in systemic stress given the quality of our unencumbered securities the positive track record of the fhlbs in stress and the commitment of the frb to continue as lender of last resort in systemic stress scenarios we view contingent liquidity risk at our banking subsidiaries both cbna and cbpa to be relatively modest given the size and configuration of their respective balance sheets 

given the structure of their balance sheets funding liquidity of cbna and cbpa would be materially affected by an adverse idiosyncratic event eg a major loss causing a perceived or actual deterioration in its financial condition an adverse systemic event eg default or bankruptcy of a significant capital markets participant or a combination of both eg the financial crisis of 20082010 however during the financial crisis our banking subsidiaries reduced their dependence on unsecured wholesale funding to virtually zero consequently and despite ongoing exposure to a variety of idiosyncratic and systemic events we view our funding liquidity risk to be relatively modest 

an additional variable affecting our access and the access of our banking subsidiaries to unsecured wholesale market funds and to large denomination ie uninsured customer deposits is the credit ratings assigned by such agencies as moody’s standard  poor’s and fitch the following table presents our credit ratings 



changes in our public credit ratings could affect both the cost and availability of our wholesale funding as a result and in order to maintain a conservative funding profile our banking subsidiaries continue to minimize reliance on unsecured wholesale funding at december 31 2015  the majority of wholesale funding consisted of secured borrowings primarily fhlb advances secured primarily by highquality residential loan collateral our dependence on shortterm unsecured and creditsensitive funding continues to be relatively low 

citizens financial group inc 

management’s discussion and analysis 

existing and evolving regulatory liquidity requirements represent another key driver of systemic liquidity conditions and liquidity management practices the frbg evaluates our liquidity as part of the supervisory process and the federal reserve board recently issued regulations that will require us to conduct regular liquidity stress testing over various time horizons and to maintain a buffer of highly liquid assets sufficient to cover expected net cash outflows and projected loss or impairment of funding sources for a shortterm liquidity stress scenario in addition the basel committee has developed a set of internationallyagreed upon quantitative liquidity metrics the lcr and the nsfr 

the lcr was developed to ensure banks have sufficient highquality liquid assets to cover expected net cash outflows over a 30day liquidity stress period in september 2014 the us federal banking regulators published the final rule to implement the lcr this rule also introduced a modified version of the lcr in the united states which generally applies to bhcs not active internationally institutions with less than 10 billion of onbalance sheet foreign exposure with total assets of greater than 50 billion but less than 250 billion under this definition we are designated as a modified lcr company as compared to the basel committee’s version of the lcr the version of the lcr issued by the us federal banking regulators includes a narrower definition of highquality liquid assets different prescribed cash inflow and outflow assumptions for certain types of instruments and transactions and a shorter phasein schedule that began on january 1 2015 and ends on january 1 2017 notably as a modified lcr company we were required to be 90 compliant beginning in january 2016 and 100 compliant beginning in january 2017 achieving sustainable lcr compliance may require changes in the size andor composition of our investment portfolio the configuration of our discretionary wholesale funding portfolio and our average cash position we were compliant with the lcr as of december 31 2015  and we were fully compliant with the lcr as of the required implementation date of january 2016 

the nsfr was developed to provide a sustainable maturity structure of assets and liabilities and has a time horizon of one year the basel committee contemplates that the nsfr including any revisions will be implemented as a minimum standard by january 1 2018 however the us federal banking regulators have not yet published a proposed rule to implement the nsfr in the united states 

we continue to review and monitor these liquidity requirements to develop appropriate implementation plans and liquidity strategies we expect to be fully compliant with the final rules on or prior to the applicable effective date 

liquidity risk management and governance 

liquidity risk is measured and managed by the funding and liquidity unit within our treasury unit in accordance with policy guidelines promulgated by our board and the asset and liability management committee in managing liquidity risk the funding and liquidity unit delivers regular and comprehensive reporting including current levels versus threshold limits for a broad set of liquidity metrics explanatory commentary relating to emerging risk trends and as appropriate recommended remedial strategies 

the mission of our funding and liquidity unit is to deliver prudent levels of current projected and contingent liquidity from stable sources in a timely manner and at a reasonable cost without significant adverse consequences 

we seek to accomplish this mission by funding loans with stable deposits by prudently controlling dependence on wholesale funding particularly shortterm unsecured funding and by maintaining ample available liquidity including a contingent liquidity buffer of unencumbered highquality loans and securities 

as of december 31 2015

management’s discussion and analysis 

  

the funding and liquidity unit monitors a variety of liquidity and funding metrics including specific risk threshold limits the metrics are broadly classified as follows

critical accounting estimates 

our audited consolidated financial statements which are included elsewhere in this report are prepared in accordance with gaap the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to establish accounting policies and make estimates that affect amounts reported in our audited consolidated financial statements 

an accounting estimate requires assumptions and judgments about uncertain matters that could have a material effect on our audited consolidated financial statements estimates are made using facts and circumstances known at a point in time changes in those facts and circumstances could produce results substantially different from those estimates the most significant accounting policies and estimates and their related application are discussed below

allowance for credit losses 

management’s estimate of probable losses in our loan and lease portfolios including unfunded lending commitments is recorded in the alll and the reserve for unfunded lending commitments at levels that we believe to be appropriate as of the balance sheet date our determination of such estimates is based on a periodic evaluation of the loan and lease portfolios and unfunded credit facilities as well as other relevant factors this evaluation is inherently subjective and requires significant estimates and judgments of underlying factors all of which are susceptible to change 

the alll and reserve for unfunded lending commitments could be affected by a variety of internal and external factors internal factors include portfolio performance such as delinquency levels assigned risk ratings the mix and level of loan balances differing economic risks associated with each loan category and the financial condition of specific borrowers external factors include fluctuations in the general economy unemployment rates bankruptcy filings developments within a particular industry changes in collateral values and factors particular to a specific commercial credit such as competition business and management performance the alll may be adjusted to reflect our current assessment of various qualitative risks factors and events that may not be measured in our statistical procedures there is no certainty that the alll and reserve for unfunded lending commitments will be appropriate over time to cover losses because of unanticipated adverse changes in any of these internal external or qualitative factors 

the evaluation of the adequacy of the commercial commercial real estate and lease alll and reserve for unfunded lending commitments is primarily based on risk rating models that assess probability of default loss given default and exposure at default on an individual loan basis the models are primarily driven by individual customer financial characteristics and are validated against historical experience additionally qualitative factors may be included in the risk rating models after the aggregation of individual borrower incurred loss additional overlays can be made based on backtesting against historical losses and forward loss curve ratios 

for nonaccruing commercial and commercial real estate loans with an outstanding balance of 3 million or greater and for all commercial and commercial real estate tdrs regardless of size we conduct specific analysis on a loan level basis to determine the probable amount of credit loss if appropriate a specific alll is established for the loan through a charge to the provision for credit losses for all classes of impaired loans individual loan measures of impairment may result in a chargeoff to the alll if deemed appropriate in such cases the provision for credit losses is not affected when a specific reserve for at least that amount already exists techniques utilized include comparing the loan’s carrying amount to the estimated present value of its future cash flows the fair value of its underlying collateral or the loan’s observable market price the technique applied to each impaired loan is based on the workout officer’s opinion of the most probable workout scenario historically this has generally led to the use of the estimated present value of future cash flows approach the fair value of underlying collateral will be used if the loan is deemed collateral dependent for loans that use the fair value of underlying collateral approach a chargeoff assessment is performed quarterly to write the loans down to fair value 

for most nonimpaired retail loan portfolio types the alll is based upon the incurred loss model utilizing the pd lgd and exposure at default on an individual loan basis when developing these factors we may consider the loan product and collateral type ltv ratio lien position borrower’s credit time outstanding geographic location delinquency status and incurred loss period incurred loss periods are reviewed and updated at least annually and potentially more frequently when economic situations change rapidly as they tend to fluctuate with economic cycles incurred loss periods are generally longer in good economic times and shorter in bad times certain retail portfolios including sbo home equity loans student loans and credit card receivables utilize roll rate models to estimate the alll for the portfolios measured using the incurred loss model roll rate models are also used to support management overlays if deemed necessary 

for home equity lines and loans a number of factors impact the pd specifically the borrower’s current fico score the utilization rate delinquency statistics borrower income current cltv ratio and months on books are all used to assess the borrower’s creditworthiness similarly the loss severity is also impacted by various factors including the utilization rate the cltv ratio the lien position the housing price index change for the location as measured by the caseshiller index months on books and current loan balance 

when we are not in a first lien position we use delinquency information on the first lien exposures obtained from thirdparty credit information providers in the credit assessment for all first liens whether owned by a third party or by us an additional assessment is performed on a quarterly basis in this assessment the most recent three months’ performance of the senior liens is reviewed for delinquency 90 days or more past due modification foreclosure andor bankruptcy statuses if any derogatory status is present the junior lien will be placed on nonaccrual status regardless of its delinquency status on our books this subsequent change to nonaccrual status will alter the treatment in the pd model thus affecting the reserve calculation 

in addition the first lien exposure is combined with the second lien exposure to generate a cltv the cltv is a more accurate reflection of the leverage of the borrower against the property value as compared to the ltv from just the junior liens the cltv is used for modeling both the junior lien pd and lgd this also impacts the alll rates for the junior lien helocs 

citizens financial group inc 

management’s discussion and analysis 

the above measures are all used to assess the pd and lgd for heloc borrowers for whom we originated the loans there is also a portfolio of home equity products that were originated and serviced by others however we currently service some of the loans in this portfolio the sbo portfolio is modeled as a separate class and the reserves for this class are generated by using the delinquency roll rate models as described below 

for retail tdrs that are not collateraldependent allowances are developed using the present value of expected future cash flows compared to the recorded investment in the loans expected redefault factors are considered in this analysis retail tdrs that are deemed collateraldependent are written down to the fair market value of the collateral less costs to sell the fair value of collateral is periodically monitored subsequent to the modification 

changes in the levels of estimated losses even if minor can significantly affect management’s determination of an appropriate alll for consumer loans losses are affected by such factors as loss severity collateral values economic conditions and other factors a 1 and 5 increase in the estimated loss rate for consumer loans at december 31 2015  would have increased the alll by 5 million  and 26 million  respectively the alll for our commercial banking segment is sensitive to assigned credit risk ratings and inherent loss rates if 10 and 20 of the december 31 2015  year end loan balances including unfunded commitments within each risk rating category of our commercial banking segment had experienced downgrades of two risk categories the alll would have increased by 36 million  and 72 million  respectively 

commercial loans and leases are charged off to the alll when there is little prospect of collecting either principal or interest chargeoffs of commercial loans and leases usually involve receipt of borrowerspecific adverse information for commercial collateraldependent loans an appraisal or other valuation is used to quantify a shortfall between the fair value of the collateral less costs to sell and the recorded investment in the commercial loan retail loan chargeoffs are generally based on established delinquency thresholds rather than borrowerspecific adverse information when a loan is collateraldependent any shortfalls between the fair value of the collateral less costs to sell and the recorded investment is promptly charged off placing any loan or lease on nonaccrual status does not by itself require a partial or total chargeoff however any identified losses are charged off at that time

fair value 

we measure fair value using the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date fair value is based upon quoted market prices in an active market where available if quoted prices are not available observable marketbased inputs or independently sourced parameters are used to develop fair value whenever possible such inputs may include prices of similar assets or liabilities yield curves interest rates prepayment speeds and foreign exchange rates 

we classify our assets and liabilities that are carried at fair value in accordance with the threelevel valuation hierarchy 

 classification in the hierarchy is based upon the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement of the asset or liability for instruments classified in level 1 and 2 where inputs are primarily based upon observable market data there is less judgment applied in arriving at the fair value for instruments classified in level 3 management judgment is more significant due to the lack of observable market data 

significant assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis include our mortgagebacked securities available for sale these instruments are priced using an external pricing service and are classified as level 2 within the fair value hierarchy the service’s pricing models use predominantly observable valuation inputs to measure the fair value of these securities under both the market and income approaches the pricing service utilizes a matrix pricing methodology to price our us agency passthrough securities which involves making adjustments to tobeannounced security prices based on a matrix of various mortgagebacked securities characteristics such as weightedaverage maturities indices and other poollevel information other agency and nonagency mortgagebacked securities are priced using a discounted cash flow methodology this methodology includes estimating the cash flows expected to be received for each security using projected prepayment speeds and default rates based on historical 

citizens financial group inc 

management’s discussion and analysis 

statistics of the underlying collateral and current market conventions these estimated cash flows are then discounted using marketbased discount rates that incorporate characteristics such as average life volatility ratings performance of the underlying collateral and prevailing market conditions 

we review and update the fair value hierarchy classifications on a quarterly basis changes from one quarter to the next related to the observability of inputs in fair value measurements may result in a reclassification between the fair value hierarchy levels and are recognized based on yearend balances we also verify the accuracy of the pricing provided by our primary external pricing service on a quarterly basis this process involves using a secondary external vendor to provide valuations for our securities portfolio for comparison purposes any securities with discrepancies beyond a certain threshold are researched and if necessary valued by an independent outside broker 

fair value is also used on a nonrecurring basis to evaluate certain assets for impairment or for disclosure purposes examples of nonrecurring uses of fair value include mortgage servicing rights accounted for by the amortization method loan impairments for certain loans and goodwill 

for additional information regarding our fair value measurements see note 1 “significant accounting policies” note 3 “securities” note 10 “mortgage banking” and note 16 “derivatives” to our audited consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 — financial statements and supplementary data included elsewhere in this report 

goodwill 

goodwill is an asset that represents the future economic benefits arising from other assets acquired in a business combination that are not individually identified and separately recognized goodwill is not amortized but is subject to annual impairment tests goodwill is assigned to reporting units at the date the goodwill is initially recorded a reporting unit is a business operating segment or a component of a business operating segment once goodwill has been assigned to reporting units it no longer retains its association with a particular acquisition and all of the activities within a reporting unit whether acquired or organically grown are available to support the value of the goodwill 

the goodwill impairment analysis is a twostep test the first step used to identify potential impairment involves comparing each reporting unit’s fair value to its carrying value including goodwill if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value applicable goodwill is deemed to be not impaired if the carrying value exceeds fair value there is an indication of impairment and the second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment 

the second step involves calculating an implied fair value of goodwill for each reporting unit for which the first step indicated impairment the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination which is the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit as determined in the first step over the aggregate fair values of the individual assets liabilities and identifiable intangible assets as if the reporting unit were being acquired in a business combination if the implied fair value of goodwill exceeds the carrying value of goodwill assigned to the reporting unit there is no impairment if the carrying value of goodwill assigned to a reporting unit exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill an impairment charge is recorded for the excess an impairment loss recognized cannot exceed the amount of goodwill assigned to a reporting unit and the loss establishes a new basis in the goodwill subsequent reversal of goodwill impairment losses is not permitted 

we review goodwill for impairment annually as of october 31 or more often if events or circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of one or more reporting units is below its carrying value we rely on the income approach discounted cash flow method as the primary method for determining fair value marketbased methods are used as benchmarks to corroborate the value determined by the discounted cash flow method 

we rely on several assumptions when estimating the fair value of our reporting units using the discounted cash flow method these assumptions include the current discount rate as well as projected loan losses income taxes and capital retention rates discount rates are estimated based on the capital asset pricing model which considers the riskfree interest rate market risk premium beta and unsystematic risk and size premium adjustments specific to a particular reporting unit the discount rates are also calibrated on the assessment of the risks related to the projected cash flows of each reporting unit multiyear financial forecasts are developed for each reporting unit by considering several key business drivers such as new business initiatives customer retention standards market share changes anticipated loan and deposit growth forward interest rates historical performance and industry and economic trends among other considerations the longterm growth rate used in determining the terminal value of each reporting unit was estimated based on management’s assessment of the minimum expected terminal growth rate of each reporting unit as well as broader economic considerations such as gross domestic product and inflation 

we corroborate the fair value of our reporting units determined by the discounted cash flow method using marketbased methods a comparable company method and a comparable transaction method the comparable company method measures fair value of a business by comparing it to publicly traded companies in similar lines of business this involves identifying and selecting the comparable companies based on a number of factors ie size growth profitability risk and return on investment calculating 

citizens financial group inc 

management’s discussion and analysis 

the market multiples ie pricetotangible book value pricetocash earnings and pricetonet income of these comparable companies and then applying these multiples to our operating results to estimate the value of the reporting unit’s equity on a marketable minority basis a control premium is then applied to this value to estimate the fair value of the reporting unit on a marketable controlling basis the comparable transaction method measures fair value of a business based on exchange prices in actual transactions and on asking prices for controlling interests in public or private companies currently offered for sale the process involves comparison and correlation of us with other similar companies adjustments for differences in factors described earlier ie size growth profitability risk and return on investment are also considered 

as a best practice we also corroborate the fair value of our reporting units determined by the discounted cash flow method by adding the aggregated sum of these fair value measurements to the fair value of our nonsegment operations and comparing this total to our observed market capitalization as part of this process we analyze the implied control premium to evaluate its reasonableness all facts and circumstances are considered when completing this analysis including observed transaction data and any additional external evidence supporting the implied control premium since none of our reporting units are publicly traded individual reporting unit fair value determinations cannot be directly correlated to cfg’s common stock price the sum of the fair values of the reporting units at october 31 2015 exceeded the overall market capitalization of cfg as of october 31 2015 although we believe it is reasonable to conclude that market capitalization could be an indicator of fair value over time we do not believe that our current market capitalization reflects the aggregate fair value of our individual reporting units 

the valuation of goodwill is dependent on forwardlooking expectations related to the performance of the us economy and our associated financial performance the prolonged delay in the full recovery of the us economy and the impact of that delay on earnings expectations prompted a goodwill impairment test as of june 30 2013 although the us economy has demonstrated signs of recovery notably improvements in unemployment and housing the pace and extent of recovery in these indicators as well as in overall gross domestic product have lagged previous expectations the impact of the slow recovery is most evident in our consumer banking reporting unit accordingly the percentage by which the estimated fair value of our consumer banking reporting unit exceeded its carrying value declined from 7 at december 31 2011 to 5 at december 31 2012 

during the first half of 2013 we observed further deceleration of expected growth for our consumer banking reporting unit’s future profits based on forecasted economic growth for the us economy and the continuing impact of the new regulatory framework in the financial industry this deceleration was incorporated into our revised earnings forecast in the second quarter of 2013 and we subsequently concluded that there was a likelihood of greater than 50 that goodwill impairment had occurred as of june 30 2013 

an interim goodwill impairment test was subsequently performed for our consumer banking and commercial banking reporting units step one of these tests indicated that 1 the fair value of our consumer banking reporting unit was less than its carrying value by 19 and 2 the fair value of our commercial banking reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by 27 step two of the goodwill impairment test was subsequently performed for our consumer banking reporting unit which resulted in the recognition of a pretax 44 billion impairment charge in our consolidated statement of operations for the period ending june 30 2013 the impairment charge which was a noncash item had minimal impact on our tier 1 riskbased and total riskbased capital ratios the impairment charge had no impact on our liquidity position or tangible common equity 

we performed an annual test for impairment of goodwill for both reporting units as of october 31 2015 as of this testing date the percentage by which the fair value of our consumer banking reporting unit exceeded its carrying value was 6 and the percentage by which the fair value of our commercial banking reporting unit exceeded its carrying value was 8 

we based the fair value estimates used in our annual goodwill impairment testing on assumptions we believe to be representative of assumptions that a market participant would use in valuing the reporting units but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain including estimates of future growth rates and operating margins and assumptions about the overall economic climate and the competitive environment for our reporting units there can be no assurances that future estimates and assumptions made for purposes of goodwill testing will prove accurate predictions of the future if the assumptions regarding business plans competitive environments market conditions or anticipated growth rates are not achieved or a market participant view of our total fair value declines we may be required to record goodwill impairment charges in future periods

income taxes 

accrued income taxes are reported as a component of either other assets or other liabilities as appropriate in the consolidated balance sheets and reflect our estimate of income taxes to be paid or that effectively have been prepaid deferred income tax assets and liabilities represent the amount of future income taxes to be paid or that effectively have been prepaid and the net balance is reported as an asset or liability in the consolidated balance sheets we determine the realization of the deferred tax asset based upon an evaluation of the four possible sources of taxable income 1 the future reversals of taxable temporary differences 2 future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards 3 taxable income in prior carryback years and 4 tax planning strategies in projecting future taxable income we utilize forecasted pretax earnings adjust for the estimated book tax differences and incorporate assumptions including the amount of income allocable to taxing jurisdictions these assumptions require significant judgment and are consistent with the plans and estimates that we use to manage the underlying businesses the realization of the deferred tax assets could be reduced in the future if these estimates are significantly different than forecasted 

we are subject to income tax in the united states and multiple state and local jurisdictions the tax laws and regulations in each jurisdiction may be interpreted differently in certain situations which could result in a range of outcomes thus we are required to exercise judgment regarding the application of these tax laws and regulations we evaluate and recognize tax liabilities related to any tax uncertainties due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties the ultimate resolution may differ from the current estimate of tax liabilities or refunds 

our estimate of accrued income taxes deferred income taxes and income tax expense can also change in any period as a result of new legislative or judicial guidance impacting tax positions as well as changes in income tax rates any changes if they occur can be significant to our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows

risk governance 

we are committed to maintaining a strong integrated and proactive approach to the management of all risks to which we are exposed in pursuit of our business objectives a key aspect of our board’s responsibility as the main decision making body is setting our risk appetite to ensure that the levels of risk that we are willing to accept in the attainment of our strategic business and financial objectives are clearly understood 

to enable the board to carry out its objectives it has delegated authority for risk management activities as well as governance and oversight of those activities to a number of board and executive management level risk committees the key committees that specifically consider risk across the enterprise are set out in the diagram below 

citizens financial group inc 

management’s discussion and analysis 

chief risk officer 

the cro directs our overall risk management function overseeing the credit interest rate  market liquidity operational compliance strategic and reputational risk management the cro reports to our ceo and to the board risk committee 

risk framework 

our risk management framework is embedded in our business through a “three lines of defense” model which defines responsibilities and accountabilities 

first line of defense 

the business lines including their associated support functions are the first line of defense and are accountable for owning and managing within our defined risk appetite the risks which exist in their respective business areas the business lines are responsible for performing regular risk assessments to identify and assess the material risks that arise in their area of responsibility complying with relevant risk policies testing and certifying the adequacy and effectiveness of their controls on a regular basis establishing and documenting operating procedures and establishing and owning a governance structure for identifying and managing risk 

second line of defense 

the second line of defense includes independent monitoring and control functions accountable for developing and ensuring implementation of risk and control frameworks and related policies this centralized risk function is appropriately independent from the business and is accountable for overseeing and challenging our business lines on the effective management of their risks this risk function utilizes training communications and awareness to provide expert support and advice to the business lines this includes interpreting the risk policy standards and risk management framework overseeing compliance by the businesses with policies and responsibilities including providing relevant management information and escalating concerns where appropriate 

the executive risk committee chaired by the cro actively considers our inherent material risks analyzes our overall risk profile and seeks confirmation that the risks are being appropriately identified assessed and mitigated 

third line of defense 

our internal audit function is the third line of defense providing independent assurance with a view of the effectiveness of citizens’ internal controls governance practices and culture so that risk is managed appropriately for the size complexity and risk profile of the organization internal audit has complete and unrestricted access to any and all bank records physical properties and personnel internal audit issues a report following each internal review and provides an audit opinion to citizens’ audit committees on a quarterly basis 

credit quality assurance also reports to the chief audit executive and also provides the boards senior management and other stakeholders with independent assurance on the quality of credit portfolios and adherence to agreed credit risk appetite and credit policies and processes in line with its procedures and regulatory expectations the credit quality assurance function undertakes a program of portfolio testing assessing and reporting through four risk pillars of asset quality rating and data integrity risk management and credit risk appetite 

risk appetite 

risk appetite is a strategic business and risk management tool we define our risk appetite as the maximum limit of acceptable risk beyond which we would either be unable to achieve our strategic objectives and capital adequacy obligations or would assume an unacceptable amount of risk to do so the board risk committee advises our board of directors in relation to current and potential future risk strategies including determination of risk appetite and tolerance 

the principal nonmarket risks to which we are subject are credit risk operational risk liquidity risk strategic risk and reputational risk we are also subject to market risks market risk refers to potential losses arising from changes in interest rates foreign exchange rates equity prices commodity prices andor other relevant market rates or prices modest market risk arises from trading activities that serve customer needs including hedging of interest rate and foreign exchange risk as described below more material market risk arises from our nontrading banking activities such as loan origination and deposit gathering we have established enterprisewide policies and methodologies to identify measure monitor and report market risk we actively manage both trading and nontrading market risks we are also subject to liquidity risk discussed under “—liquidity” 

our risk appetite framework and risk limit structure establishes guidelines to determine the balance between existing and desired levels of risk and supports the implementation measurement and management of our risk appetite

credit risk 

overview 

credit risk represents the potential for loss arising from a customer counterparty or issuer failing to perform in accordance with the contractual terms of the obligation while the majority of our credit risk is associated with lending activities we do engage with other financial counterparties for a variety of purposes including investing asset and liability management and trading activities given the financial impact of credit risk on our earnings and balance sheet the assessment approval and management of credit risk represents a major part of our overall riskmanagement responsibility 

objective 

the credit risk management organization is responsible for approving credit transactions monitoring portfolio performance identifying problem loans and ensuring remedial management 

organizational structure 

management and oversight of credit risk is the responsibility of both the line of business and the second line of defense the second line of defense the independent credit risk function is led by the chief credit officer who oversees all of our credit risk the cco reports to the chief risk officer the cco acting in a manner consistent with board policies has responsibility for among other things the governance process around policies procedures risk acceptance criteria credit risk appetite limits and authority delegation the cco and his team also have responsibility for credit approvals for larger or more risky transactions and oversight of line of business credit risk activities reporting to the cco are the heads of the second line of defense credit functions specializing in consumer banking business banking commercial banking citizens restructuring management portfolio analytics and reporting and credit policy and administration each team under these leaders is composed of highly experienced credit professionals 

the credit risk teams operate independently from the business lines to ensure decisions are not influenced by unbalanced objectives 

governance 

the primary mechanisms used to govern our credit risk function are our consumer and commercial credit policies these policies outline the minimum acceptable lending standards that align with our desired risk appetite material issues or changes are identified by the individual committees and presented to the credit policy committee executive risk committee and the board risk committee for approval as appropriate 

key management processes 

to ensure credit risks are managed within our risk appetite and business and risk strategies are achieved we employ a comprehensive and integrated control program the program’s objective is to proactively 1 identify 2 measure 3 monitor and 4 mitigate existing and emerging credit risks across the credit lifecycle origination account managementportfolio management and loss mitigation and recovery 

consumer 

on the consumer banking side of credit risk our teams use models to evaluate consumer loans across the lifecycle of the loan starting at origination credit scoring models are used to forecast the probability of default of an applicant these models are embedded in the loan origination system which allows for realtime scoring and automated decisions for many of our products periodic validations are performed on our purchased and proprietary scores to ensure fit for purpose when approving customers for a new loan or extension of an existing credit line credit scores are used in conjunction with other credit risk variables such as affordability length of term collateral value collateral type and lien subordination 

the origination process is supported by dedicated underwriting teams that reside in the business line the size of each team depends on the intensity of the approval process as the number of handoffs documentation and verification requirements differ substantially depending on the loan product 

to ensure proper oversight of the underwriting teams lending authority is granted by the second line of defense credit risk function to each underwriter the amount of delegated authority depends on the experience of the individual we periodically evaluate the performance of each underwriter and annually reauthorize their delegated authority only senior members of the second line of defense credit risk team are authorized to approve significant exceptions to credit policies it is not uncommon to make exceptions to established policies when compensating factors are present there are exception limits which when reached trigger a comprehensive analysis 

citizens financial group inc 

management’s discussion and analysis 

once an account is established credit scores and collateral values are refreshed at regular intervals to allow for proactive identification of increasing or decreasing levels of credit risk for accounts with contingent liability revolving feature credit policies have been developed that leverage the refreshed customer data to determine if a credit line should be increased decreased frozen or closed lastly behavioral modeling segmentation and loan modifications are used to cure delinquency reduce the severity of loss and maximize recoveries our approach to managing credit risk is highly analytical and where appropriate is automated to ensure consistency and efficiency 

the credit risk team is constantly evaluating current and projected economic conditions internal credit performance in relation to budget and predefined risk tolerances and current and expected regulatory guidance to determine the optimal balance of expansion and contraction policies all policy change proposals receive intense scrutiny and discussion prior to approval and implementation this process ensures decisions are made based on riskbased analytics with full adherence to regulatory requirements 

commercial 

on the commercial banking side of credit risk the structure is broken into ci loans and leases and cre within ci there are separate verticals established for certain specialty products eg assetbased lending leasing franchise finance health care technology midcorporate a “specialty vertical” is a standalone team of industry or product specialists substantially all activity that falls under the ambit of the defined industry or product is managed through a specialty vertical when one exists cre also operates as a specialty vertical 

commercial credit risk management begins with defined credit products and policies 

commercial transactions are subject to individual analysis and approval at origination and with few exceptions are subject to a formal annual review requirement the underwriting process includes the establishment and approval of credit grades that confirm the probability of default “pd” and loss given default “lgd” approval then requires both a business line approver and an independent credit approver with the requisite level of delegated authority the approval level of a particular credit facility is determined by the size of the credit relationship as well as the pd the checks and balances in the credit process and the independence of the credit approver function are designed to appropriately assess and sanction the level of credit risk being accepted facilitate the early recognition of credit problems when they occur and to provide for effective problem asset management and resolution all authority to grant credit is delegated through the independent credit risk function and is closely monitored and regularly updated 

the primary factors considered in commercial credit approvals are the financial strength of the borrower assessment of the borrower’s management capabilities cash flows from operations industry sector trends type and sufficiency of collateral type of exposure transaction structure and the general economic outlook while these are the primary factors considered there are a number of other factors that may be considered in the decision process in addition to the credit analysis conducted during the approval process at origination and annual review our credit quality assurance group performs testing to provide an independent review and assessment of the quality of the portfolio and new originations this group conducts portfolio reviews on a riskbased cycle to evaluate individual loans validate risk ratings as well as test the consistency of the credit processes and the effectiveness of credit risk management 

the maximum level of credit exposure to individual credit borrowers is limited by policy guidelines based on the perceived risk of each borrower or related group of borrowers concentration risk is managed through limits on industry sector loan type asset class and loan quality factors we focus predominantly on extending credit to commercial customers with existing or expandable relationships within our primary markets for this purpose defined as our 11 state footprint plus contiguous states although we do engage in lending opportunities outside our primary markets if we believe that the associated risks are acceptable and aligned with strategic initiatives 

apart from industrials and cre which together make up 30 of the commercial outstandings as of december 31 2015  there are no material sector concentrations as of december 31 2015  our cre outstandings amounted to 9 of total loans and leases the industrial sector includes basic ci lending focused on general manufacturing the sector is diversified and not managed as a specialized vertical our customers are local to our market and present no significant concentration 

our credit grading system considers many components that directly correlate to loan quality and likelihood of repayment our assessment of a borrower’s credit strength is reflected in our risk ratings for such loans which are also an integral component of our alll methodology when deterioration in credit strength is noted a loan becomes subject to watch review the watch review process involves senior representatives from the business line portfolio management team the independent credit risk team and our citizens restructuring management group as appropriate and consistent with regulatory definitions the credit may be subject to classification as either criticized or classified which would also trigger a credit rating downgrade as such the loan and relationship would be subject to more frequent review 

citizens financial group inc 

management’s discussion and analysis 

substantially all loans categorized as classified are managed by citizens restructuring management a specialized group of credit professionals that handles the daytoday management of workouts commercial recoveries and problem loan sales its responsibilities include developing and implementing action plans assessing risk ratings determining the appropriateness of specific reserves relating to the loan accrual status of the loan and the ultimate collectability of loans in their portfolio 

market risk 

market risk refers to potential losses arising from changes in interest rates foreign exchange rates equity prices commodity prices andor other relevant market rates or prices modest market risk arises from trading activities that serve customer needs including hedging of interest rate and foreign exchange risk as described below more material market risk arises from our nontrading banking activities such as loan origination and depositgathering we have established enterprisewide policies and methodologies to identify measure monitor and report market risk we actively manage both trading and nontrading market risks 

nontrading risk 

we are exposed to market risk as a result of nontrading banking activities this market risk is composed entirely of interest rate risk as we have no direct currency or commodity risk and de minimis equity risk this interest rate risk emerges from the balance sheet after the aggregation of our assets liabilities and equity we refer to this nontrading risk embedded in the balance sheet as “structural interest rate risk” or “interest rate risk in the banking book” our mortgage servicing rights assets also contain interest rate risk as the value of the fee stream is impacted by the level of longterm interest rates 

a major source of structural interest rate risk is a difference in the repricing of assets on the one hand and liabilities and equity on the other first there are differences in the timing of rate changes reflecting the maturity andor repricing of assets and liabilities for example the rate earned on a residential mortgage may be fixed for 30 years the rate paid on a certificate of deposit may be fixed only for a few months due to these timing differences net interest income is sensitive to changes in the level and shape of the yield curve second there are differences in the drivers of rate changes of various assets and liabilities for example commercial loans may reprice based on onemonth libor or prime the rate paid on retail money market demand accounts may be only loosely correlated with libor and depend on competitive demand for funds due to these basis differences net interest income is sensitive to changes in spreads between certain indices or repricing rates 

another important source of structural interest rate risk relates to the potential exercise of explicit or embedded options for example most consumer loans can be prepaid without penalty and most consumer deposits can be withdrawn without penalty the exercise of such options by customers can exacerbate the timing differences discussed above 

a primary source of our structural interest rate risk relates to faster repricing of floating rate loans relative to the retail deposit funding this source of asset sensitivity is concentrated at the short end of the yield curve for the past seven years with the federal funds rate near zero this risk has been asymmetrical with significantly more upside benefit than potential exposure as rates have lifted from near zero given the fomc’s december 2015 rate hike exposure to declining rates has increased the secondary source of our interest rate risk is driven by longer term rates comprising the rollover or reinvestment risk on fixed rate loans as well as the prepayment risk on mortgage related loans and securities funded by nonrate sensitive deposits and equity 

the primary goal of interest rate risk management is to control exposure to interest rate risk within policy limits approved by the board these limits and guidelines reflect our tolerance for interest rate risk over both shortterm and longterm horizons to ensure that exposure to interest rate risk is managed within this risk appetite we must both measure the exposure and as necessary hedge it the treasury asset and liability management team is responsible for measuring monitoring and reporting on the structural interest rate risk position these exposures are reported on a monthly basis to the asset and liability committee alco and at board meetings 

we measure structural interest rate risk through a variety of metrics intended to quantify both shortterm and longterm exposures the primary method that we use to quantify interest rate risk is simulation analysis in which we model net interest income from assets liabilities and hedge derivative positions under various interest rate scenarios over a threeyear horizon exposure to interest rate risk is reflected in the variation of forecasted net interest income across scenarios 

key assumptions in this simulation analysis relate to the behavior of interest rates and spreads the changes in product balances and the behavior of loan and deposit clients in different rate environments the most material of these behavioral assumptions relate to the repricing characteristics and balance fluctuations of deposits with indeterminate ie noncontractual maturities as well as the pace of mortgage prepayments assessments are periodically made by running sensitivity analysis of the impact of key assumptions the results of these analyses are reported to alco 

as the future path of interest rates cannot be known in advance we use simulation analysis to project net interest income under various interest rate scenarios including a “most likely” implied forward scenario as well as a variety of deliberately extreme and perhaps unlikely scenarios these scenarios may assume gradual ramping of the overall level of interest rates immediate shocks to the level of rates and various yield curve twists in which movements in short or longterm rates predominate generally 

citizens financial group inc 

management’s discussion and analysis 

projected net interest income in any interest rate scenario is compared to net interest income in a base case where market forward rates are realized 

the table below reports net interest income exposures against a variety of interest rate scenarios exposures are measured as a percentage change in net interest income over the next year due to either instantaneous or gradual parallel  200 basis point moves in benchmark interest rates the net interest income simulation analyses do not include possible future actions that management might undertake to mitigate this risk the current limit is a decrease in net interest income of 10 related to an instantaneous  200 basis point move as the table illustrates our balance sheet is assetsensitive net interest income would benefit from an increase in interest rates exposure to a decline in interest rates is well within limit it should be noted that the magnitude of any possible decline in interest rates is constrained by the low absolute starting levels of rates while an instantaneous and severe shift in interest rates was used in this analysis we believe that any actual shift in interest rates would likely be more gradual and would therefore have a more modest impact 

the table below summarizes our positioning in various parallel yield curve shifts 



as part of the routine risk management process a wide variety of similar analysis are reported for each of the next three rolling years 

we also use a valuation measure of exposure to structural interest rate risk economic value of equity “eve” as a supplement to net interest income simulations eve complements net interest income simulation analysis as it estimates risk exposure over a longterm horizon eve measures the extent to which the economic value of assets liabilities and offbalance sheet instruments may change in response to fluctuation in interest rates this analysis is highly dependent upon assumptions applied to assets and liabilities with noncontractual maturities the change in value is expressed as a percentage of regulatory capital the current risk limit is set at a decrease of 20 of regulatory capital given an instantaneous  200 basis point change in interest rates we are operating within that limit as of december 31 2015 

we are asset sensitive and as such are positioned to benefit from an increase in interest rates we have consistently maintained the level of overall asset sensitivity in a tight range of 61 to 72 over the past year as defined by the 200 gradual change 

we also had market risk associated with the value of the mortgage servicing right assets which are impacted by the level of interest rates as of december 31 2015  and 2014 our mortgage servicing rights had a book value of 164 million  and 166 million  respectively and were carried at the lower of cost or fair value as of december 31 2015  and 2014 the fair value of the mortgage servicing rights was 178 million  and 179 million  respectively given low interest rates over recent years there is a valuation allowance of 9 million  and 18 million  on the asset as of december 31 2015  and 2014 respectively depending on the interest rate environment hedges may be used to stabilize the market value of the mortgage servicing right asset 

trading risk 

we are exposed to market risk primarily through client facilitation activities including derivatives and foreign exchange products exposure is created as a result of changes in interest rates and related basis spreads and volatility foreign exchange rates and credit spreads on a select range of interest rates foreign exchange and secondary loans instruments these trading activities are conducted through our two banking subsidiaries cbna and cbpa 

citizens financial group inc 

management’s discussion and analysis 

client facilitation activities consist primarily of interest rate derivatives and foreign exchange contracts where we enter into offsetting trades with a separate counterparty or exchange to manage our market risk exposure we will occasionally execute hedges against the spread that exists across the client facing trade and its offset in the market to maintain a low risk profile in addition to the aforementioned activities we operate a secondary loan trading desk with the objective to meet secondary liquidity needs of our issuing clients’ transactions and investor clients we do not engage in any trading activities with the intent to benefit from short term price differences 

we record interest rate derivatives and foreign exchange contracts as derivative assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets trading assets and liabilities are carried at fair value with income earned related to these activities included in net interest income changes in fair value of trading assets and liabilities are reflected in other income a component of noninterest income on the consolidated statements of operations 

market risk governance   

our market risk framework currently leverages rbs technology platform to aggregate measure and monitor exposure against market risk limits as part of our separation from rbs we have entered into a transitional services agreement pursuant to which rbs will continue to provide us with all necessary var and other risk measurements required for regulatory reporting related to interest rate derivatives and foreign exchange trading activities as well as internal market risk reporting until the end of the transitional services agreement during the term of the transitional services agreement we are building out our own market risk organization and framework in order to gradually migrate away from reliance on services provided by rbs 

given the low level of traded market risk we have received the support of our us banking regulators for relying on rbs’ market risk technology platform in managing our market risk dealing authorities represent a key control in the management of market risk by setting the scope within which the business is permitted to operate dealing authorities are established jointly by designated senior business line and senior risk manager and are reviewed at least annually dealing authorities are structured to accommodate the client facing trades market offset trades and sets of hedges needed to maintain a low risk profile primary responsibility for keeping within established tolerances resides with the business key risk indicators including a combined var for interest rate and foreign exchange rate risk are monitored on a daily basis and reported against tolerances consistent with our risk appetite and business strategy to relevant business line management and risk counterparts 

market risk measurement 

we use var metrics complemented with sensitivity analysis market value and stress testing in measuring market risk during the term of the transition services agreement we will continue to leverage rbs market risk measurement models for our foreign exchange and interest rate products which are described further below that capture correlation effects and allow for aggregation of market risk across risk types business lines and legal entities we measure and monitor market risk for both management and regulatory capital purposes 

valueatrisk overview 

  the market risk measurement model is based on historical simulation the var measure estimates the extent of any fair value losses on trading positions that may occur due to broad market movements general var such as changes in the level of interest rates foreign exchange rates equity prices and commodity prices it is calculated on the basis that current positions remain broadly unaltered over the course of a given holding period it is assumed that markets are sufficiently liquid to allow the business to close its positions if required within this holding period var’s benefit is that it captures the historic correlations of a portfolio based on the composition of our “covered positions” we also use a standardized addon approach for the loan trading desk’s specific risk capital which estimates the extent of any losses that may occur from factors other than broad market movements in addition for our secondary traded loans we calculate the var on the general interest rate risk embedded within the loans using a standalone model that replicates the general var methodology the related capital is reflected on the “de minimis” line in the following section the general var approach is expressed in terms of a confidence level over the past 500 trading days the internal var measure used as the basis of the main var trading limits is a 99 confidence level with a one day holding period meaning that a loss greater than the var is expected to occur on average on only one day in 100 trading days ie 1 of the time theoretically there should be a loss event greater than var two to three times per year the regulatory measure of var is done at a 99 confidence level with a 10day holding period the historical market data applied to calculate the var is updated on a 10 business day lag refer to “market risk regulatory capital” below for details of our 10day var metrics for the quarters ended december 31 2015  and 2014 including high low average and period end valueatrisk for interest rate and foreign exchange rate risks as well as total var 

market risk regulatory capital   

effective january 1 2013 the us banking regulators adopted “riskbased capital guidelines market risk” as the regulations covering the calculation of market risk capital the “market risk rule” the market risk rule commonly known as 

citizens financial group inc 

management’s discussion and analysis 

basel 25 substantially modified the determination of market riskweighted assets and implemented a more risk sensitive methodology for the risk inherent in certain trading positions categorized as “covered positions” for the purposes of the market risk rule all of our client facing trades market offset trades and sets of hedges needed to maintain a low risk profile to qualify as “covered positions” the internal var measure is calculated based on the same population of trades that is utilized for regulatory var the following table shows the results of our modeled and nonmodeled measures for regulatory capital calculations 



  

1 the high and low for the portfolio may have occurred on different trading days than the high and low for the components therefore there is no diversification benefit shown for the high and low columns 

stressed var   

svar is an extension of var but uses a longer historical look back horizon that is fixed from january 3 2005 this is done not only to identify headline risks from more volatile periods but also to provide a counter balance to var which may be low during periods of low volatility the holding period for profit and loss determination is 10 days svar is also a component of market risk regulatory capital svar for us is calculated under its own dynamic window regime as compared to rbs’ static svar window in a dynamic window regime values of the 10day 99 var are calculated over all possible 260day periods that can be obtained from the complete historical data set refer to “market risk regulatory capital” above for details of svar metrics including high low average and period end svar for the combined portfolio 

sensitivity analysis   

sensitivity analysis is the measure of exposure to a single risk factor such as a one basis point change in rates or credit spread we conduct and monitor sensitivity on interest rates basis spreads foreign exchange exposures and option prices whereas var is based on previous moves in market risk factors over recent periods it may not be an accurate predictor of future market moves sensitivity analysis complements var as it provides an indication of risk relative to each factor irrespective of historical market moves and is an effective tool in evaluating the appropriateness of hedging strategies 

stress testing   

conducting a stress test of a portfolio consists of running risk models with the inclusion of key variables that simulate various historical or hypothetical scenarios for historical stress tests profit and loss results are simulated for selected time periods corresponding to the most volatile underlying returns while hypothetical stress tests aim to consider concentration risk illiquidity under stressed market conditions and risk arising from the bank’s trading activities that may not be fully captured by its other models hypothetical scenarios also assume that the market moves happen simultaneously and that no repositioning or hedging activity takes place to mitigate losses as events unfold we generate stress tests of our trading positions on a regular basis for example we currently include a stress test that simulates a lehmantype crisis scenario by taking the worst 10day peak to trough moves for the various risk factors that go into var from that period and assumes they occurred simultaneously 

var model review and validation   

market risk measurement models used are independently reviewed the models used under the transitional services agreement are subject to ongoing and independent review and validation that focuses on the model methodology independent 

citizens financial group inc 

management’s discussion and analysis 

review of market risk measurement models is the responsibility of rbs risk analytics aspects covered include challenging the assumptions used the quantitative techniques employed and the theoretical justification underpinning them and an assessment of the soundness of the required data over time where possible the quantitative impact of the major underlying modeling assumptions will be estimated eg through developing alternative models results of such reviews are shared with us regulators for the term of the transitional services agreement we and rbs expect to utilize the same independently validated var model for both management and regulatory reporting purposes rbs market risk teams including those providing consultative services to us under the transitional services agreement will conduct internal validation before a new or changed model element is implemented and before a change is made to a market data mapping for example rbs market risk teams also perform regular reviews of key risk factors that are used in the market risk measurement models to produce profit and loss vectors used in the var calculations these internal validations are subject to independent revalidation by rbs risk analytics and depending on the results of the impact assessment notification to the appropriate regulatory authorities for rbs and us may be required 

var backtesting   

backtesting is one form of validation of the var model the market risk rule requires a comparison of our internal var measure to the actual net trading revenue excluding fees commissions reserves intraday trading and net interest income for each day over the preceding year the most recent 250 business days any observed loss in excess of the var number is taken as an exception the level of exceptions determines the multiplication factor used to derive the var and svarbased capital requirement for regulatory reporting purposes we perform subportfolio backtesting as required under the market risk rule and as approved by our banking regulators for interest rate and foreign exchange positions the following table shows our daily net trading revenue and total internal modeled var for the quarters ended december 31 2015  september 30 2015 june 30 2015 and march 31 2015 beginning in the quarter ended september 30 2015 as agreed with our banking regulators we use a multiplication factor derived from our specific backtesting results and no longer that of rbs

our history 

in september 2014 citizens financial group cfg nyse became a publiclytraded company in the largest traditional bank initial public offering “ipo” in us history the ipo represented an important step in our planned separation from rbs group which has announced its plans to monetize its remaining ownership stake by the end of 2016 

our history dates back to high street bank founded in 1828 which established citizens savings bank in 1871 citizens savings bank acquired a controlling interest in its founder by the 1940s renaming the entity citizens trust company by 1981 we had grown to 29 branches in rhode island with approximately 10 billion of assets and in 1988 we became a whollyowned subsidiary of rbs group over the following two decades we grew substantially through a series of over 25 strategic bank acquisitions including 

 

 

 

 

 these acquisitions greatly expanded our footprint throughout new england and into the midatlantic and the midwest transforming us from a local retail bank into one of the largest retail us bank holding companies

our competitive strengths 

our long operating history through a range of challenging economic cycles forms the basis for our competitive strengths from our community bank roots we bring a commitment to strong customer relationships local service and an active involvement in the communities we serve our acquisitions enabled us to develop significant scale in highly desirable markets and broad product capabilities the actions taken since the global financial crisis have resulted in a business model with solid asset quality a stable core deposit mix and a superior capital position in particular we believe that the following strengths differentiate us from our competitors and provide a strong foundation from which to execute our strategy to deliver enhanced growth profitability and returns

 business strategy 

building on our core strengths our objective is to be a topperforming bank that delivers well for each of our stakeholders by offering the best possible banking experience for customers we plan to achieve this by leveraging our strong customer relationships leading market share rankings in attractive markets customercentric colleagues and our high quality balance sheet 

our strategy is designed to maximize the full potential of our business and drive sustainable growth and enhanced profitability as a core measure of success our two to threeyear financial targets include a return on tangible common equity rotce ratio of greater than 10 and an efficiency ratio in the 60 range our financial targets are based on numerous assumptions including the yield curve evolving consistent with market implied forward rates as of february 28 2014 and that macroeconomic and competitive conditions are consistent with those used in our planning assumptions 

 10 

citizens financial group inc 

  

while our strategic plan and our rotce target and its components are presented with numerical specificity and we believe such targets to be reasonable given the uncertainties surrounding our assumptions including possible regulatory restrictions on activities we intend to pursue there are significant risks that these assumptions may not be realized and thus our goals may not be achieved accordingly our actual results may differ from these targets and the differences may be material and adverse particularly if actual events adversely differ from one or more of our key assumptions we caution investors not to place undue reliance on any of these assumptions or targets 

we intend to deliver on this by adhering to the following strategic principles 

 

 

 

 

 

 in order to successfully execute on these principles we have developed the following strategic priorities each of which are underpinned by a series of initiatives as summarized below we have made solid progress on our strategic priorities and the underlying initiatives over the past year due primarily to the strength of our business model management team culture of accountability and risk management framework 

position consumer banking to deliver improved capabilities and profitability  consumer banking offers a “simple clear personal” value proposition to our customers the focus is on building strong customer relationships along with a robust product portfolio that is designed to be simple and easy to understand while creating a fair value exchange for our customers the following initiatives are being implemented to execute against our value proposition 

 

 

   

 

 

  11 

citizens financial group inc 

  

these initiatives have already resulted in a stronger consumer franchise highlighted by 2014 net checking account growth of over 78000 and nearly 22 million checking households the percent of newtobank customers with over two products within 30 days of account opening increased by 78 percentage points from 2013  to 304 in 2014  additionally consumer banking loans and leases of 499 billion at december 31 2014 grew 49 billion or 11 from december 31 2013  finally the overall customer satisfaction index for consumer banking as measured by jd power and associates improved 65 in the new england region from 2013  to 2014  

continue the momentum in commercial banking   we continue to see further buildout of the commercial banking business as critical to achieving a balanced business mix and consequently have grown the contribution of commercial loans to be 44 of operating segment loans compared to 38 at year end 2010 the initiatives below have enabled the commercial banking business to continue its positive momentum while building upon existing strengths to further develop the “thought leadership” value proposition 

 

 

 

 

 

the commercial banking business has continued to display solid financial results and executed well on these initiatives with loan portfolio growth of 37 billion or 10 yearoveryear along with strong deposit growth as average deposits increased 23 billion in 2014  or 13 compared to the average level of deposits for 2013  in addition we improved our league table standings in the overall national middle market bookrunner league table to 8th by number of syndicated loans for the full year 2014 according to thomson reuters and received a number one rank by greenwich associates in our net promoter score compared to the top four competitors in our footprint based on rolling fourquarter data through december 31 2014 net promoter score is a customer loyalty metric which is calculated by subtracting the percentage of customers who on a scale of 110 are detractors rating 06 from the percentage of customers who are promoters rating 910 

grow the balance sheet to build scale and better leverage our cost base and infrastructure we have a scalable operating platform that has the capacity to accommodate a significantly larger balance sheet than our current size prior to the global financial crisis we had expanded to nearly 170 billion in assets which was then intentionally contracted in order to reposition the bank and strengthen our business profile through the runoff of noncore assets and reduced dependency on wholesale funding 

over the past year we have begun to grow the consolidated balance sheet again through organic growth and selective portfolio purchases 

 

  12 

citizens financial group inc 

  

 

balance sheet expansion is critical to executing on our strategic priority of enhancing our return profile and efficiency by better leveraging our existing capital position infrastructure and expense base 

develop a highperforming customercentric organization and culture  in the midst of an evolving and challenging business environment we are focused on delivering the best possible banking experience through our colleagues as such we strive to ensure that managers and colleagues are customer centric have a commitment to excellence and live the values and credo every day to further strengthen the organization’s health we have embarked on initiatives focused on a variety of people issues including recruiting talent management succession planning leadership development organizational structure and incentives 

continue to embed risk management throughout the organization and build strong relationships with regulators  we remain committed to implementing a comprehensive enterprise risk management program through enhancements across key management areas critical objectives of the program are to have fully developed and embedded policies and risk appetite frameworks and standards clearly articulated roles and responsibilities across all lines of defense and a culture that reinforces and rewards riskbased behaviors 

focus on improved efficiency and disciplined expense management  we believe that our focus on operational efficiency is critical to our profitability and ability to reinvest in the franchise we launched an initiative in late 2013  designed to improve the effectiveness efficiency and competitiveness of the franchise reflecting our focus on cost discipline these expense initiatives delivered against milestones with 28 of targeted efficiency initiatives savings in 2014  with an expectation that we will achieve 200 million by the end of 2016 proceeds from the program are being reinvested in the franchise including investments in technology and in our strategic initiatives designed to further improve the customer experience and position us for future growth 

our strategic initiatives are focused on the fundamentals of growing customers relationships loans deposits total revenue and overall profitability while the above priorities are designed to enhance performance over the longterm successful execution to date has resulted in improved financial performance in 2014  as highlighted below

initial public offering 

in september 2014 we completed the largest traditional bank ipo in us history which involved the sale of 161 million shares at 2150 per share or 35 billion of our common stock which was held by rbs group we did not receive any proceeds from the initial public offering our common stock is listed on the new york stock exchange “nyse” under the symbol “cfg” 

 13 

citizens financial group inc 

  

as of december 31 2014  rbs group owned 705 of our common shares outstanding and has an agreement with its primary regulator and the european commission that it will divest its remaining ownership interest by december 31 2016 unless certain conditions occur 

chicago divestiture 

effective june 20 2014 we divested certain assets and liabilities associated with our chicagoarea retail branches small business relationships and select middle market relationships in a sale to us bancorp “chicago divestiture” the transaction included 103 branches including 94 fullservice branches 48 billion of deposits and 10 billion in loans as of june 20 2014 we received a 6 deposit premium in the sale which resulted in a gain on sale of 288 million as a result of the transaction the strategic rationale underlying the decision to sell the franchise was an inability to gain market share in the intensely competitive chicago market without expending considerable resources rather we were able to leverage the competitive dynamics of the demographically attractive market to sell the franchise at a meaningful gain the capital generated from the gain on sale is being utilized to fund a number of key performance enhancement initiatives including delivery of greater efficiency and incremental earning asset generation 

competition 

the financial services industry in general and in our branch footprint is highly competitive our branch footprint is in the new england midatlantic and midwest regions though certain lines of business serve broader national markets within those markets we face competition from community banks superregional and national financial institutions credit unions savings and loan associations mortgage banking firms consumer finance companies securities brokerage firms insurance companies and money market funds some of our larger competitors may make available to their customers a broader array of product pricing and structure alternatives while some smaller competitors may have more liberal lending policies and processes competition among providers of financial products and services continues to increase with consumers having the opportunity to select from a growing variety of traditional and nontraditional alternatives the ability of nonbanking financial institutions to provide services previously limited to commercial banks has intensified competition 

in consumer banking the industry has become increasingly dependent on and oriented towards technologydriven delivery systems permitting transactions to be conducted by telephone and computer as well as through online and mobile channels in addition technology has lowered the barriers to entry and made it possible for nonbank institutions to attract funds and provide lending and other financial services in our footprint despite not having a physical presence within our footprint given their lower cost structure these institutions are often able to offer rates on deposit products that are higher than what may be average for the market for retail banking institutions with a traditional branch footprint such as us the primary factors driving competition for loans and deposits are interest rates fees charged customer service levels convenience including branch location and hours of operation and the range of products and services offered in particular the competition for home equity lines and auto loans has intensified resulting in pressure on pricing 

in commercial banking there is intense competition for quality loan originations from traditional banking institutions particularly large regional banks as well as commercial finance companies leasing companies and other nonbank lenders and institutional investors including collateralized loan obligation “clo” managers hedge funds and private equity firms some larger competitors including certain national banks that have a significant presence in our market area may offer a broader array of products and due to their asset size may sometimes be in a position to hold more exposure on their own balance sheet we compete on a number of factors including among others customer service quality of execution range of products offered price and reputation 

intellectual property 

in the highly competitive banking industry in which we operate trademarks service marks trade names and logos are important to the success of our business we own and license a variety of trademarks service marks trade names logos and pending registrations and are spending significant resources to develop our standalone brands in connection with our initial public offering we entered into a trademark license agreement pursuant to which we were granted a limited license to use certain rbs trademarks including the daisywheel logo for an initial term of five years and at our option up to 10 years we have changed the legal names of any of our subsidiaries that included “rbs” and have continued operational and legal work to rebrand cfg and our banking subsidiaries we expect the process of changing all marketing materials operational materials signage systems and legal entities containing “rbs” to our new brand name will take approximately 14 months and cost approximately 14 million excluding any incremental advertising and customer communication expenses we expect to then shift the majority of our advertising and marketing budget to our new brand progressively as the different legal entities complete their individual brand name changes we expect the shift in advertising and marketing investment to be completed no later than july 31 2015

information technology systems 

we have recently made and continue to make significant investments in our information technology systems for our banking and lending and cash management activities we believe this is a necessary investment in order to offer new products and improve our overall customer experiences as well as to provide scale for future growth and acquisitions the technology investments include replacing systems that support our branch tellers commercial loans automobile loans and treasury solutions additional investments that are in process include creating an enterprise data warehouse to capture and manage data to better understand our customers identify our capital requirements and support regulatory reporting and a new mortgage system for our home lending solutions business 

regulation and supervision 

  our operations are subject to extensive regulation supervision and examination under federal and state law these laws and regulations cover all aspects of our business including lending practices safeguarding deposits customer privacy and information security capital structure transactions with affiliates and conduct and qualifications of personnel these laws and regulations are intended primarily for the protection of depositors the deposit insurance fund and the banking system as a whole and not for the protection of shareholders and creditors 

in 2010 president obama signed into law the doddfrank act which restructured the financial regulatory regime in the united states the doddfrank act represents a significant overhaul of many aspects of the regulation of the financial services industry addressing among other things systemic risk capital adequacy deposit insurance assessments consumer financial protection regulation of derivatives and securities markets restrictions on an insured bank’s transactions with its affiliates lending limits and mortgagelending practices various provisions of the doddfrank act discussed in greater detail below require the issuance of many implementing regulations which will take effect over several years making it difficult to anticipate the overall impact to us our subsidiaries or the financial industry more generally although the overall impact cannot be predicted with any degree of certainty the doddfrank act will affect us across a wide range of areas 

as a result of and in addition to new legislation aimed at regulatory reform such as the doddfrank act and the increased capital and liquidity requirements introduced by the us implementation of the basel iii framework the capital components of which have become effective as to us on january 1 2015 subject to certain phasein provisions the federal banking agencies the federal reserve board the occ and the fdic as well as the consumer financial protection bureau “cfpb” are taking a more stringent approach to supervising and regulating financial institutions and financial products and services over which they exercise their respective supervisory authorities we our two banking subsidiaries and our products and services are all subject to greater supervisory scrutiny and enhanced supervisory requirements and expectations and face significant challenges in meeting them we expect to continue to face greater supervisory scrutiny and enhanced supervisory requirements for the foreseeable future 

general 

as a bank holding company and financial holding company as defined in the bank holding company act of 1956 “bank holding company act” we are subject to regulation supervision and examination by the federal reserve board including through the federal reserve bank of boston 

cbna is a national banking association as such it is subject to regulation examination and supervision by the occ as its primary federal regulator and by the fdic as the insurer of its deposits 

cbpa is a pennsylvaniachartered savings bank accordingly it is subject to supervision by the department of banking of the commonwealth of pennsylvania the “pa banking department” as its chartering agency and regulation supervision and examination by the fdic as the primary federal regulator of statechartered savings banks and as the insurer of its deposits 

a principal objective of the us bank regulatory system is to protect depositors by ensuring the financial safety and soundness of banks to that end the banking regulators have broad regulatory examination and enforcement authority the regulators regularly examine our operations and cfg and our banking subsidiaries are subject to periodic reporting requirements 

the regulators have various remedies available if they determine that the financial condition capital resources asset quality earnings prospects management liquidity or other aspects of a banking organization’s operations are unsatisfactory the regulators may also take action if they determine that the banking organization or its management is violating or has violated any law or regulation the regulators have the power to among other things 

  15 

citizens financial group inc 

  

 cbna and cbpa are subject to various requirements and restrictions under federal and state law including requirements to maintain reserves against deposits restrictions on the types and amounts of loans that may be granted and the interest that may be charged and limitations on the types of investments that may be made activities that may be engaged in the opening and closing of branches and types of services that may be offered the consumer lending and finance activities of cbna and cbpa are also subject to extensive regulation under various federal and state laws these statutes impose requirements on the making enforcement and collection of consumer loans and on the types of disclosures that must be made in connection with such loans cbna and cbpa and certain of their subsidiaries are also prohibited from engaging in certain tiein arrangements in connection with extensions of credit leases or sales of property or furnishing products or services 

in addition cbna and cbpa are subject to regulation supervision and examination by the cfpb the cfpb has broad authority to among other things regulate the offering and provision of consumer financial products by depository institutions with more than 10 billion in total assets the cfpb may promulgate rules under a variety of consumer financial protection statutes including the truth in lending act the electronic funds transfer act and the real estate settlement procedures act 

the doddfrank act established the financial stability oversight council which has oversight authority for monitoring and regulating systemic risk and can recommend prudential standards reporting and disclosure requirements to the federal reserve board for systemically important financial institutions 

financial holding company regulation 

the grammleachbliley act of 1999 “glba” permits a qualifying bank holding company to become a financial holding company financial holding companies may engage in a broader range of activities than those permitted for a bank holding company which are limited to i banking managing or controlling banks ii furnishing services to or performing services for subsidiaries and iii activities that the federal reserve board has determined to be so closely related to banking as to be a proper incident thereto glba broadens the scope of permissible activities for financial holding companies to include among other things securities underwriting and dealing insurance underwriting and brokerage merchant banking and other activities that are declared by the federal reserve board in cooperation with the treasury department to be “financial in nature or incidental thereto” or that the federal reserve board declares unilaterally to be “complementary” to financial activities in addition a financial holding company may conduct permissible new financial activities or acquire permissible nonbank financial companies with afterthefact notice to the federal reserve board 

we have elected and qualified for financial holding company status under the glba to maintain financial holding company status a financial holding company and its banking subsidiaries must remain well capitalized and well managed and maintain a community reinvestment act “cra” rating of at least “satisfactory” if a financial holding company ceases to meet these requirements the federal reserve board’s regulations provide that we must enter into an agreement with the federal reserve board to comply with all applicable capital and management requirements until the financial holding company returns to compliance the federal reserve board may impose limitations or conditions on the conduct of its activities and the company may not commence any of the broader financial activities permissible for financial holding companies or acquire a company engaged in such financial activities without prior approval of the federal reserve board in addition the failure to meet such requirements could result in other material restrictions on the activities of the financial holding company and may also adversely affect the financial holding companys ability to enter into certain transactions including acquisition transactions or obtain necessary approvals in connection therewith any restrictions imposed on our activities by the federal reserve board may not necessarily be made known to the public if the company does not return to compliance within 180 days the federal reserve board may require divestiture of the financial holding company’s depository institutions failure to satisfy the financial holding company requirements could also result in loss of financial holding company status bank holding companies and banks must also be both well capitalized and well managed in order to acquire banks located outside their home state 

in march 2014 the occ communicated its determination that cbna is not currently both well capitalized and well managed as those terms are defined in applicable regulations based on certain minimum capital ratios and supervisory ratings

respectively and consequently no longer meets the condition to own a financial subsidiary a financial subsidiary is permitted to engage in a broader range of activities similar to those of a financial holding company than those permissible for a national bank itself cbna has two financial subsidiaries citizens securities inc doing business as cco investment services corp a registered brokerdealer and rbs citizens insurance agency inc a dormant entity although it continues to collect commissions on certain outstanding insurance policies cbna has entered into an agreement with the occ pursuant to which it must develop a remediation plan which must be approved by the occ setting forth the specific actions it will take to bring itself back into compliance with the conditions to own a financial subsidiary and the schedule for achieving that objective until cbna addresses the deficiencies to the occ’s satisfaction cbna will be subject to restrictions on its ability to acquire control or build an interest in any new financial subsidiary and to commence new activities in any existing financial subsidiary without the prior approval of the occ if cbna fails to remediate the deficiencies it may have to divest itself of its financial subsidiaries and comply with any additional limitations or conditions on its conduct as the occ may impose cbna has developed a plan to address the deficiencies and has implemented a comprehensive enterprisewide program through which many deficiencies we believe have been addressed 

separately cbna is also making improvements to its compliance management systems risk management and deposit reconciliation practices in order to address deficiencies in those areas cbpa is making improvements to address deficiencies in its deposit reconciliation practices overdraft fees identity theft addon products thirdparty payment processor activities oversight of thirdparty providers compliance program policies procedures and training consumer complaints process and antimoney laundering controls these efforts require us to make investments in additional resources and systems and also require a significant commitment of managerial time and attention 

we are also required to make improvements to our overall compliance and operational risk management programs and practices in order to comply with enhanced supervisory requirements and expectations and to address weaknesses in retail credit risk management liquidity risk management model risk management outsourcing and vendor risk management and related oversight and monitoring practices and tools our and our banking subsidiaries consumer compliance program and controls also require improvement particularly with respect to deposit reconciliation processes fair lending and mortgage servicing 

currently under the bank holding company act we may not be able to engage in certain categories of new activities or acquire shares or control of other companies other than in connection with internal reorganizations 

standards for safety and soundness 

the federal deposit insurance act “fdia” requires the federal reserve board occ and fdic to prescribe operational and managerial standards for all insured depository institutions including cbna and cbpa the agencies have adopted regulations and interagency guidelines which set forth the safety and soundness standards used to identify and address problems at insured depository institutions before capital becomes impaired if an agency determines that a bank fails to satisfy any standard it may require the bank to submit an acceptable plan to achieve compliance consistent with deadlines for the submission and review of such safety and soundness compliance plans 

under section 616 of the doddfrank act which codifies the federal reserve board’s longstanding “source of strength” doctrine any bank holding company that controls an insured depository institution must serve as a source of financial and managerial strength for its depository institution subsidiary the statute defines “source of financial strength” as the ability to provide financial assistance in the event of the financial distress at the insured depository institution the federal reserve board may require a bank holding company to provide such support at times when it may not have the financial resources to do so or when doing so is not otherwise in the interests of cfg or its shareholders or creditors 

cbpa is also subject to supervision by the pa banking department the pa banking department may order any pennsylvaniachartered savings bank to discontinue any violation of law or unsafe or unsound business practice it may also order the termination of any trustee officer attorney or employee of a savings bank engaged in objectionable activity

various federal and state statutory provisions and regulations as well as regulatory expectations limit the amount of dividends that we and our subsidiaries may pay dividends payable by cbna as a national bank subsidiary are limited to the lesser of the amount calculated under a “recent earnings” test and an “undivided profits” test under the recent earnings test a dividend may not be paid if the total of all dividends declared by a bank in any calendar year is in excess of the current year’s net income combined with the retained net income of the two preceding years less any required transfers to surplus unless the national bank obtains the approval of the occ under the undivided profits test a dividend may be paid only to the extent that retained net profits as defined and interpreted by regulation including the portion transferred to surplus exceed bad debts as defined by regulation cbna is currently required to seek the occ’s approval prior to paying any dividends to us federal bank regulatory agencies have issued policy statements which provide that fdicinsured depository institutions and their holding companies should generally pay dividends only out of their current operating earnings under pennsylvania law cbpa may declare and pay dividends 

 17

only out of accumulated net earnings and only if i any required transfer to surplus has been made prior to declaration of the dividend and ii payment of the dividend will not reduce surplus 

furthermore with respect to both cbna and cbpa if in the opinion of the applicable federal regulatory agency either is engaged in or is about to engage in an unsafe or unsound practice which depending on the financial condition of the bank could include the payment of dividends the regulator may require after notice and hearing that such bank cease and desist from such practice the occ and the fdic have indicated that the payment of dividends would constitute an unsafe and unsound practice if the payment would reduce a depository institution’s capital to an inadequate level the banking agencies have significant discretion to limit or even preclude dividends even if the statutory quantitative thresholds are satisfied 

supervisory stress tests conducted by the federal reserve board in connection with its annual comprehensive capital and analysis review “ccar” process affect our ability to make capital distributions as part of the ccar process the federal reserve board evaluates institutions’ capital adequacy and internal capital adequacy assessment processes to ensure that they have sufficient capital to continue operations during periods of economic and financial stress the federal reserve board must approve any planned distribution of capital in connection with the ccar process the federal reserve board will either object to our capital plan in whole or in part or provide a notice of nonobjection to us by march 31 of a calendar year in march 2014 the federal reserve board objected on qualitative grounds to our capital plan submitted as part of the ccar process in its public report entitled “comprehensive capital analysis and review 2014 assessment framework and results” the federal reserve board cited significant deficiencies in our capital planning processes including inadequate governance weak internal controls and deficiencies in our practices for estimating revenues and losses under a stress scenario and for ensuring the appropriateness of loss estimates across our business lines in a specific stress scenario although the federal reserve board acknowledged that bank holding companies such as ours that are new to the ccar process are subject to different expectations our weaknesses were considered serious enough to warrant the federal reserve board’s objection based on its qualitative assessment of our capital planning process as a result we are not permitted to increase our capital distributions above 2013 levels until a new capital plan is approved by the federal reserve board we submitted a new capital plan on january 5 2015 and we cannot assure you that the federal reserve board will not object to that capital plan or that even if it does not object to it our planned capital distributions will not be significantly modified 

in addition the ability of banks and bank holding companies to pay dividends and make other forms of capital distribution will also depend on their ability to maintain a sufficient capital conservation buffer under the us basel iii capital framework described further below the capital conservation buffer requirements will be phased in beginning on january 1 2016 the ability of banks and bank holding companies to pay dividends and the contents of their respective dividend policies could be impacted by a range of regulatory changes made pursuant to the doddfrank act many of which still require final implementing rules to become effective in addition the federal reserve board recently amended its capital planning and stress testing rules to among other things generally limit a bank holding company’s ability to make quarterly capital distributions — that is dividends and share repurchases — commencing april 1 2015 if the amount of the bank’s actual cumulative quarterly capital issuances of instruments that qualify as regulatory capital are less than the bank had indicated in its submitted capital plan as to which it received a non−objection from the federal reserve board subject to certain qualifications and exceptions 

federal deposit insurance act 

the fdia imposes various requirements on insured depository institutions for example the fdia requires among other things that the federal banking agencies take “prompt corrective action” in respect of depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements which are described below in “capital” the fdia sets forth the following five capital tiers “wellcapitalized” “adequately capitalized” “undercapitalized” “significantly undercapitalized” and “critically undercapitalized” a depository institution’s capital tier will depend upon how its capital levels compare with various relevant capital measures and certain other factors that are established by regulation 

the fdia prohibits any depository institution from making any capital distributions including payment of a dividend or paying any management fee to its parent holding company if the depository institution would thereafter be “undercapitalized” “undercapitalized” institutions are subject to growth limitations and are required to submit a capital restoration plan for a capital restoration plan to be acceptable among other things the depository institution’s parent holding company must guarantee that the institution will comply with the capital restoration plan if a depository institution fails to submit an acceptable capital restoration plan it is treated as if it is “significantly undercapitalized” “significantly undercapitalized” depository institutions may be subject to a number of requirements and restrictions including orders to sell sufficient voting stock to become “adequately capitalized” orders to elect a new board of directors requirements to reduce total assets and cessation of receipt of deposits from correspondent banks “critically undercapitalized” institutions are subject to the appointment of a receiver or conservator 

the fdia prohibits insured banks from accepting brokered deposits or offering interest rates on any deposits significantly higher than the prevailing rate in the bank’s normal market area or nationally depending upon where the deposits are solicited 

 18 

citizens financial group inc 

  

unless it is “wellcapitalized” or it is “adequately capitalized” and receives a waiver from the fdic a bank that is “adequately capitalized” and that accepts brokered deposits under a waiver from the fdic may not pay an interest rate on any deposit in excess of 75 basis points over certain prevailing market rates the fdia imposes no such restrictions on a bank that is “wellcapitalized” 

the fdia requires cbna and cbpa to pay deposit insurance assessments deposit insurance assessments are based on average consolidated total assets less average tangible equity and various other regulatory factors included in a fdic assessment scorecard deposit insurance assessments are also affected by the minimum reserve ratio with respect to the deposit insurance fund “dif” the minimum reserve ratio is currently 2 and the fdic is free to increase this ratio in the future 

under the fdia banks may also be held liable by the fdic for certain losses incurred or reasonably expected to be incurred by the dif either cbna and cbpa may be liable for losses caused by the other’s default and also may be liable for any assistance provided by the fdic to the other if it is in danger of default 

capital 

we must comply with capital adequacy standards established by the federal reserve board cbna and cbpa must comply with similar capital adequacy standards established by the occ and fdic respectively we currently have capital in excess of the “wellcapitalized” standards described below for more detail on our regulatory capital see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — capital” in part ii item 7 included elsewhere in this report 

basel iii final rules applicable to us and our banking subsidiaries 

in july 2013 the federal reserve board occ and fdic issued the us basel iii final rule the final rule implements the basel iii capital framework and certain provisions of the doddfrank act including the collins amendment which establishes minimum riskbased capital and leverage requirements on a consolidated basis for insured depository institutions and their bank holding companies certain aspects of the final rule such as the new minimum capital ratios changes to the prompt corrective action ratios to reflect the higher minimum capital ratios for the various capital tiers and the revised methodology for calculating riskweighted assets became effective on january 1 2015 other aspects of the final rule such as the capital conservation buffer and the new regulatory deductions from and adjustments to capital will be phased in over several years beginning on january 1 2015 

the us basel iii final rule includes a new minimum ratio of cet1 capital to riskweighted assets of 45 and a cet1 capital conservation buffer of greater than 25 of riskweighted assets that will apply to all us banking organizations failure to maintain the capital conservation buffer will result in increasingly stringent restrictions on a banking organization’s ability to make dividend payments and other capital distributions and pay discretionary bonuses to executive officers the final rule also increases the minimum ratio of tier 1 capital to riskweighted assets from 4 to 6 while maintaining the minimum total riskbased capital ratio of 8 in addition for the largest and most internationally active us banking organizations the final rule includes a new minimum supplementary leverage ratio that takes into account certain offbalance sheet exposures 

the us basel iii final rule focuses regulatory capital on cet1 capital and introduces new regulatory adjustments and deductions from capital as well as narrower eligibility criteria for regulatory capital instruments consistent with the requirements of the collins amendment the new eligibility criteria for regulatory capital instruments results in among other things trust preferred securities no longer qualifying as tier 1 capital for bank holding companies such as us the final rule also revises the methodology for calculating riskweighted assets for certain types of assets and exposures 

capital requirements applicable to us as in effect on december 31 2014 

under the “basel i” regulatory capital framework that was in effect for us and our banking subsidiaries as of december 31 2014 capital was divided into two tiers tier 1 capital consisted principally of stockholders’ equity less any amounts of goodwill other intangible assets nonfinancial equity investments and other items that are required to be deducted tier 2 capital consisted principally of term subordinated debt and subject to limitations general allowances for loan losses assets were adjusted under the riskbased guidelines to take into account different risk characteristics quarterly average onbalance sheet assets for purpose of the leverage ratio did not include goodwill other intangible assets or items that the federal reserve board has determined should be deducted from tier 1 capital 

under the thenapplicable capital adequacy guidelines bank holding companies had to maintain a tier 1 riskbased capital ratio of at least 4 a total riskbased capital ratio of at least 8 and a leverage ratio of at least 4 to qualify as “well capitalized” a bank holding company had to maintain a tier 1 riskbased capital ratio of at least 6 a total riskbased capital ratio of at least 10 and a leverage ratio of at least 5

liquidity standards 

the federal reserve board evaluates our liquidity as part of the supervisory process in september 2014 the federal reserve board occ and fdic issued a final rule to implement the basel iii liquidity coverage ratio “lcr” the lcr is a quantitative liquidity metric designed by the basel committee to ensure that banks have sufficient highquality liquid assets to cover expected net cash outflows over a 30day liquidity stress period the basel committee contemplates that major jurisdictions will begin to phase in the lcr requirement on january 1 2015 the final us lcr rule applies a modified version of the lcr to large bank holding companies such as us the modified version of the lcr differs in certain respects from the basel committee’s version of the lcr including a narrower definition of highquality liquid assets different prescribed cash inflow and outflow assumptions for certain types of instruments and transactions and a shorter phasein schedule that begins on january 1 2015 and ends on january 1 2017 

the basel committee also has finalized its net stable funding ratio “nsfr” a quantitative liquidity metric designed to promote the resilience of a bank’s liquidity risk profile over a longer period than the lcr the nsfr establishes a minimum acceptable amount of stable funding based on the liquidity characteristics of an institution’s assets and activities over a oneyear horizon the nsfr has been developed to provide a sustainable maturity structure of assets and liabilities the final rule will be implemented as a minimum standard by january 1 2018 federal banking regulators have not yet proposed rules to implement the nsfr in the united states 

in addition under the doddfrank act the federal reserve board has implemented enhanced prudential standards for bank holding companies with 50 billion or more in total consolidated assets see “—enhanced prudential standards” these regulations will require us to conduct regular liquidity stress testing over various time horizons and to maintain a buffer of higher liquid assets sufficient to cover expected net cash outflows and projected loss or impairment of funding sources for a shortterm liquidity stress scenario this liquidity buffer requirement is designed to complement the basel iii lcr 

  stress testing requirements 

the federal reserve board occ and fdic have promulgated final rules under the doddfrank act requiring us cbna and cbpa to conduct annual stress tests and publish a summary of the results separately the federal reserve board has issued an interim final rule specifying how large bank holding companies should incorporate the us basel iii capital standards into their 2014  capital plan and stress test capital projections among other things the interim final rule requires large bank holding companies to project both their cet 1 riskbased capital ratio using the methodology under existing capital guidelines and their cet 1 riskbased capital ratio under the us basel iii capital standards as such standards phase in over the ninequarter planning horizon 

final regulations under the volcker rule 

in december 2013 the federal reserve board occ fdic the united states securities and exchange commission “sec” and the commodity futures trading commission issued final rules to implement the volcker rule the volcker rule prohibits an insured depository institution such as cbna and cbpa and its affiliates from 1 engaging in proprietary trading or 2 investing in sponsoring or having certain relationships with certain types of funds both subject to certain limited exceptions on december 18 2014 the federal reserve board issued an order extending the volcker rule’s conformance period until july 21 2016 for investments in and relationships with “covered funds” and certain foreign funds that were in place on or prior to december 31 2013 subject to these extensions we have until july 2015 to comply with other provisions of the volcker rule these volcker rule prohibitions are expected to impact the ability of us banking organizations to provide investment management products and services that are competitive with nonbanking firms generally and with nonus banking organizations in overseas markets the volcker rule would also effectively prohibit shortterm trading strategies by any us banking organization if those strategies do not fall under the limited exceptions such as the exceptions for market makingrelated activities and riskmitigating hedging 

resolution plans 

federal reserve board and fdic regulations require a bank holding company with more than 50 billion in assets to annually submit a resolution plan that explains how in the event of material financial distress or failure the bank holding company would be resolved in a rapid orderly and systemically safe manner under the bankruptcy code an insured depository institution with more than 50 billion in assets must submit to the fdic a resolution plan that explains how the institution can be resolved in a manner that is orderly and that ensures that depositors will receive access to insured funds within certain required timeframes if the federal reserve board and the fdic jointly determine that the resolution plan of a bank holding company is not credible and the company fails to cure the deficiencies in a timely manner then the federal reserve board and the fdic may jointly impose on the company or on any of its subsidiaries more stringent capital leverage or liquidity requirements or restrictions on growth activities or operations or require the divestment of certain assets or operations we timely submitted our resolution plan jointly

with rbs on october 1 2014 when rbs no longer controls us for bank regulatory purposes we will separately file our own resolution plan with the federal reserve board and fdic 

enhanced prudential standards 

the doddfrank act requires the federal reserve board to impose liquidity single counterparty credit limits risk management and other enhanced prudential standards for bank holding companies with 50 billion or more in total consolidated assets including us the federal reserve board on february 18 2014 approved a final rule implementing certain of the enhanced prudential standards under the final rule we have to comply with various liquidity risk management standards and maintain a liquidity buffer of unencumbered highly liquid assets based on the results of internal liquidity stress testing the final rule also establishes certain requirements and responsibilities for our risk committee and mandates certain risk management standards final rules on single counterparty credit limits and an early remediation framework have not yet been promulgated 

  heightened expectations 

in september 2014 the occ finalized guidelines that establish heightened standards for large national banks with average total consolidated assets of 50 billion or more including cbna the guidelines set forth minimum standards for the design and implementation of a bank’s risk governance framework and minimum standards for oversight of that framework by a bank’s board of directors the guidelines are an extension of the occ’s “heightened expectations” for large banks that the occ began informally communicating to certain banks in 2010 the guidelines are intended to protect the safety and soundness of covered banks and improve bank examiners’ ability to assess compliance with the occ’s expectations under the guidelines a bank could use certain components of its parent company’s risk governance framework but the framework must ensure the bank’s risk profile is easily distinguished and separate from the parent for risk management and supervisory purposes a bank’s board of directors is required to have two members who are independent of the bank and parent company management a bank’s board of directors is responsible for ensuring the risk governance framework meets the standards in the guidelines providing active oversight and a credible challenge to management’s recommendations and decisions and ensuring that the parent company decisions do not jeopardize the safety and soundness of the bank 

protection of customer personal information 

the privacy provisions of the glba generally prohibit financial institutions including us from disclosing nonpublic personal financial information of consumer customers to third parties for certain purposes primarily marketing unless customers have the opportunity to opt out of the disclosure the fair credit reporting act restricts information sharing among affiliates for marketing purposes both the fair credit reporting act and regulation v issued by the federal reserve board govern the use and provision of information to consumer reporting agencies 

federal and state banking agencies have prescribed standards for maintaining the security and confidentiality of consumer information and we are subject to such standards as well as certain federal and state laws or standards for notifying consumers in the event of a security breach 

antitying restrictions 

generally a bank may not extend credit lease sell property or furnish any services or fix or vary the consideration for them on the condition that 1 the customer obtain or provide some additional credit property or services from or to that bank or its bank holding company or their subsidiaries or 2 the customer not obtain some other credit property or services from a competitor except to the extent reasonable conditions are imposed to assure the soundness of the credit extended a bank may however offer combinedbalance products and may otherwise offer more favorable terms if a customer obtains two or more traditional bank products certain foreign transactions are exempt from the general rule 

community reinvestment act “cra” requirements 

the cra requires the banking agencies to evaluate the record of us and our banking subsidiaries in meeting the credit needs of our local communities including low and moderate income neighborhoods these evaluations are considered in evaluating mergers acquisitions and applications to open a branch or facility and in the case of a bank holding company that has elected financial holding company status a cra rating of “satisfactory” is required to commence certain new financial activities or to acquire a company engaged in such activities we received a rating of “satisfactory” in our mostrecent cra evaluation

consumer financial protection regulations 

the consumer protection provisions of the doddfrank act including the transfer of much of the rulemaking supervision and enforcement authority under various consumer financial laws to the cfpb and the cfpb’s subsequent regulatory supervisory and enforcement activity have created a more intense and complex environment for consumer finance regulation the cfpb is authorized to among other things engage in consumer financial education monitor consumer complaints request data and promote the availability of financial services to underserved consumers and communities we expect increased oversight of financial services products by the cfpb which are likely to affect our operations the cfpb has significant authority to implement and enforce federal consumer finance laws including the truth in lending act the equal credit opportunity act the fair credit billing act and new requirements for financial services products provided for in the doddfrank act as well as the authority to identify and prohibit unfair deceptive or abusive acts and practices the review of products and practices to prevent such acts and practices is a continuing focus of the cfpb and of banking regulators more broadly the ultimate impact of this heightened scrutiny is uncertain but could result in changes to pricing practices products and procedures it also could result in increased costs related to regulatory oversight supervision and examination additional remediation efforts and possible penalties 

in addition the doddfrank act provides the cfpb with broad supervisory examination and enforcement authority over various consumer financial products and services including the ability to require reimbursements and other payments to customers for alleged legal violations and to impose significant penalties as well as injunctive relief that prohibits lenders from engaging in allegedly unlawful practices the cfpb also has the authority to obtain cease and desist orders providing for affirmative relief andor monetary penalties the doddfrank act and accompanying regulations including regulations to be promulgated by the cfpb are being phased in over time although some regulations have been promulgated many others have not yet been proposed or finalized for example the cfpb announced that it is considering new rules regarding debt collection practices and has proposed new regulations of prepaid accounts and proposed amendments to its regulations implementing the home mortgage disclosure act we cannot predict the terms of all of the final regulations their intended consequences or how such regulations will affect us or our industry 

the doddfrank act does not prevent states from adopting stricter consumer protection standards state regulation of financial products and potential enforcement actions could also adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

moreover retail activities of banks are subject to a variety of statutes and regulations designed to protect consumers interest and other charges collected or contracted for by banks are subject to state usury laws and federal laws concerning interest rates loan operations are also subject to federal laws applicable to credit transactions such as 

 

deposit operations also are subject to among others 

  22 

citizens financial group inc 

  

 in addition to these federal laws and regulations the guidance and interpretations of the various federal agencies charged with the responsibility of implementing such regulations also influences loan and deposit operations 

the cfpb has finalized a number of significant rules which will impact nearly every aspect of the life cycle of a residential mortgage the final rules require banks to among other things i develop and implement procedures to ensure compliance with a new “ability to repay” standard and identify whether a loan meets a new definition for a “qualified mortgage” ii implement new or revised disclosures policies and procedures for servicing mortgages including but not limited to early intervention with delinquent borrowers and specific loss mitigation procedures for loans secured by a borrower’s principal residence iii comply with additional restrictions on mortgage loan originator compensation and iv comply with new disclosure requirements and standards for appraisals and escrow accounts maintained for “higher priced mortgage loans” these new rules create operational and strategic challenges for us as we are both a mortgage originator and a servicer additional rulemaking affecting the residential mortgage business is also expected these rules and any other new regulatory requirements promulgated by the cfpb and other federal or state regulators could require changes to our business result in increased compliance costs and affect the streams of revenue of such business 

in addition our two banking subsidiaries are currently subject to consent orders issued by the occ and the fdic in connection with their findings of deceptive marketing and implementation of some of our checking account and funds transfer products and services among other things the consent orders require us to remedy deficiencies and develop stronger compliance controls policies and procedures we have made progress and continue to make progress in addressing these requirements but the consent orders remain in place and we are unable to predict when they may be terminated 

commercial real estate lending 

lending operations that involve concentrations of commercial real estate loans are subject to enhanced scrutiny by federal banking regulators regulators have advised financial institutions of the risks posed by commercial real estate lending concentrations such loans generally include land development construction loans and loans secured by multifamily property and nonfarm nonresidential real property where the primary source of repayment is derived from rental income associated with the property the relevant regulatory guidance prescribes the following guidelines for examiners to help identify institutions that are potentially exposed to concentration risk and may warrant greater supervisory scrutiny 

 in 2009 the federal banking regulators issued additional guidance on commercial real estate lending that emphasizes these considerations 

in addition the doddfrank act contains provisions that may cause us to reduce the amount of our commercial real estate lending and increasing the cost of borrowing including rules relating to risk retention of securitized assets section 941 of the doddfrank act requires among other things a loan originator or a securitizer of assetbacked securities to retain a percentage of the credit risk of securitized assets the banking agencies and other federal agencies have jointly promulgated a final rule to implement these requirements 

transactions with affiliates and insiders 

a variety of legal limitations restrict us from lending money to borrowing money from or in some cases transacting business with cbna and cbpa among such restrictions to which we are subject are sections 23a and 23b of the federal reserve act and federal reserve board regulation w section 23a places limits on certain specified “covered transactions” which include loans or extensions of credit to investments in or certain other transactions with affiliates as well as the amount of advances to third parties collateralized by the securities or obligations of affiliates the aggregate of all covered transactions is limited to 10 of a bank’s capital and surplus for any one affiliate and 20 for all affiliates furthermore within the foregoing limitations as to amount certain covered transactions must meet specified collateral requirements ranging from 100 to 130 also a bank is prohibited from purchasing lowquality assets from any of its affiliates section 608 of the doddfrank act broadens the definition of “covered transactions” to include derivative transactions and the borrowing or lending of securities if the transaction will cause a bank to have credit exposure to an affiliate the revised definition also includes the acceptance of debt obligations of an affiliate as collateral for a loan or extension of credit to a third party furthermore reverse repurchase transactions are viewed as extensions 

 23 

citizens financial group inc 

  

of credit instead of asset purchases and thus become subject to collateral requirements the federal reserve has not yet issued regulations to implement section 608 

section 23b prohibits an institution from engaging in certain transactions with affiliates unless the transactions are on terms substantially the same or at least as favorable to the bank as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with nonaffiliated companies except for limitations on lowquality asset purchases and transactions that are deemed to be unsafe or unsound regulation w generally excludes affiliated depository institutions from treatment as affiliates transactions between a bank and any of its subsidiaries that are engaged in certain financial activities may be subject to the affiliated transaction limits the federal reserve board also may designate banking subsidiaries as affiliates 

pursuant to federal reserve board regulation o we are also subject to quantitative restrictions on extensions of credit to executive officers directors principal stockholders and their related interests in general such extensions of credit i may not exceed certain dollar limitations ii must be made on substantially the same terms including interest rates and collateral as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with third parties and iii must not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features certain extensions of credit also require the approval of our board 

antimoney laundering usa patriot act office of foreign assets control “ofac” 

institutions must maintain antimoney laundering programs that include established internal policies procedures and controls a designated compliance officer an ongoing employee training program and testing of the program by an independent audit function we are prohibited from entering into specified financial transactions and account relationships and must meet enhanced standards for due diligence in dealings with foreign financial institutions and foreign customers we also must take reasonable steps to conduct enhanced scrutiny of account relationships to guard against money laundering and to report any suspicious transactions recent laws provide law enforcement authorities with increased access to financial information maintained by banks antimoney laundering obligations have been substantially strengthened as a result of the usa patriot act enacted in 2001 and renewed in 2006 bank regulators routinely examine institutions for compliance with these obligations and are required to consider compliance in connection with the regulatory review of applications 

the usa patriot act provides for the facilitation of information sharing among governmental entities and financial institutions for the purpose of combating terrorism and money laundering the statute also creates enhanced information collection tools and enforcement mechanics for the us government including i requiring standards for verifying customer identification at account opening ii promulgating rules to promote cooperation among financial institutions regulators and law enforcement entities in identifying parties that may be involved in terrorism or money laundering iii requiring reports by nonfinancial trades and businesses filed with the treasury’s financial crimes enforcement network for transactions exceeding 10000 and iv mandating the filing of suspicious activities reports if a bank believes a customer may be violating us laws and regulations the statute also requires enhanced due diligence requirements for financial institutions that administer maintain or manage private bank accounts or correspondent accounts for nonus persons 

the federal bureau of investigation may send bank regulatory agencies lists of the names of persons suspected of involvement in terrorist activities we can be requested to search our records for any relationships or transactions with persons on those lists and may be required to report any identified relationships or transactions furthermore ofac is responsible for helping to ensure that us entities do not engage in transactions with certain prohibited parties as defined by various executive orders and acts of congress ofac publishes and routinely updates lists of names of persons and organizations suspected of aiding harboring or engaging in terrorist acts including the specially designated nationals and blocked persons if we find a name on any transaction account or wire transfer that is on an ofac list we must freeze such account file a suspicious activity report and notify the appropriate authorities 

  other regulatory matters 

we and our subsidiaries and affiliates are subject to numerous examinations by federal and state banking regulators as well as the sec the financial industry regulation authority “finra” and various state insurance and securities regulators in some cases regulatory agencies may take supervisory actions that may not be publicly disclosed and such actions may restrict or limit our activities or activities of our subsidiaries as part of our regular examination process our and our banking subsidiaries’ respective regulators may advise us or our banking subsidiaries to operate under various restrictions as a prudential matter we and our subsidiaries have from time to time received requests for information from regulatory authorities at the federal and state level including from state insurance commissions state attorneys general federal agencies or law enforcement authorities securities regulators and other regulatory authorities concerning their business practices such requests are considered incidental to the normal conduct of business 

in order to remedy certain weaknesses including the weaknesses cited by the federal reserve board in relation to our capital planning processes and the weaknesses we are working to remedy pursuant to the occ and fdic consent orders and meet 

 24 

citizens financial group inc 

  

our significant regulatory and supervisory challenges we believe we need to make substantial improvements to our processes systems and controls see note 16 “commitments and contingencies” to our audited consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 — financial statements and supplementary data included elsewhere in this report we expect to continue to dedicate significant resources and managerial time and attention and to make significant investments in enhanced processes systems and controls this in turn may increase our operational costs and limit our ability to implement aspects of our strategic plan or otherwise pursue certain business opportunities we also expect to make restitution payments to our banking subsidiaries customers which could be significant arising from certain customer compliance deficiencies and may be required to pay civil money penalties in connection with certain of these deficiencies we have established reserves in respect of these future payments but the amounts that we are ultimately obligated to pay could be in excess of our reserves moreover if we are unsuccessful in remedying these weaknesses and meeting the enhanced supervisory requirements and expectations that apply to us and our banking subsidiaries we could remain subject to existing restrictions or become subject to additional restrictions on our activities supervisory actions or public enforcement actions including the payment of civil money penalties 

  employees 

as of december 31 2014  we had approximately 17700  ftes which included the fulltime equivalent of our approximately 17070 fulltime employees 625  parttime employees and approximately 615  positions filled by temporary employees none of our employees are parties to a collective bargaining agreement we consider our relationship with our employees to be good and have not experienced interruptions of operations due to labor disagreements

risk factors 




 item 1a risk factors 

we  are subject to a number of risks potentially impacting our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows as a financial services organization certain elements of risk are inherent in our transactions and operations and are present in the business decisions we make we therefore encounter risk as part of the normal course of our business and we design risk management processes to help manage these risks our success is dependent on our ability to identify understand and manage the risks presented by our business activities so that we can appropriately balance revenue generation and profitability these risks include but are not limited to credit risk market risk liquidity risk operational risk model risk technology regulatory and legal risk and strategic and reputational risk we discuss our principal risk management processes and in appropriate places related historical performance in “managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — risk governance” included in part ii item 7 of this report 

the following discussion sets forth some of the more important risk factors that could materially affect our business financial condition and results of operations other factors that could affect our business financial condition and results of operation are discussed in the “forwardlooking statements” section above however there may be additional risks that are not presently material or known and factors besides those discussed below or elsewhere in this or other reports that we file or furnish with the sec that could also adversely affect us 

risks related to our business 

we may not be able to successfully execute our strategic plan or achieve our performance targets 

our strategic plan which we began to implement in the second half of 2013 involves four principal elements a increasing revenue in both consumer banking and commercial banking b enhancing cost reduction efforts across the company c leveraging capital actions aimed at better aligning our capital structure with those of regional bank peers and d the beneficial impact of a rising interest rate environment on our assetsensitive balance sheet our future success and the value of our stock will depend in part on our ability to effectively implement our strategic plan there are risks and uncertainties many of which are not within our control associated with each element of our plan discussed further below 

in addition certain of our key initiatives require regulatory approval which may not be obtained on a timely basis if at all moreover even if we do obtain required regulatory approval it may be conditioned on certain organizational changes such as those discussed below that could reduce the profitability of those initiatives 

revenue generation component of strategic plan assumptions and associated risks  our plans to increase revenue involve reallocating resources toward businesses that will further increase and diversify our revenue base including by prudently growing higherreturn earning assets identifying and capitalizing on more fee income opportunities and selectively expanding our balance sheet through increased loan origination volume principally in mortgage small business and auto our revenue growth plans are based on a number of assumptions many of which involve factors that are outside our control our key assumptions include 

 

 

 

 

  26 

citizens financial group inc 

risk factors 

 

 

 if one or more of our assumptions prove incorrect we may not be able to successfully execute our strategic plan we may never achieve our indicative performance targets and any shortfall may be material 

cost savings and efficiency component of strategic plan and associated risks  in order for us to execute our strategic plan successfully we must continue to pursue a number of cost reduction and efficiency improvement initiatives including streamlining processes reducing redundancy and improving cost structures which we believe will allow us to reduce overall expenses there may be unanticipated difficulties in implementing our efficiency initiatives and while we achieved our targeted cost savings for 2014  there can be no assurance that we will fully realize our target expense reductions or be able to sustain any annual cost savings achieved by our efficiency initiative reducing costs may prove difficult in light of our efforts to continue to establish and maintain our standalone operational and infrastructural capabilities as a banking institution fully separate from rbs group including our rebranding efforts associated with our separation from rbs group reducing our structural costs also may be difficult as a result of our efforts to continue to invest in technology and people in order to make further organizational improvements in risk management and various other policies and procedures in order to comply with increased guidance new regulations and requirements imposed by our regulators in addition any significant unanticipated or unusual charges provisions or impairments including as a result of any ongoing legal and regulatory proceedings or industry regulatory changes would adversely affect our ability to reduce our cost structure in any particular period if we are unable to reduce our cost structure as we anticipate we may not be able to successfully execute our strategic plan we may never achieve our indicative performance targets and any shortfall may be material 

reduction of our common equity tier 1 ratio  our strategic plan requires us to complete capital initiatives that would result in a lower overall cet1 ratio because our capital structure is subject to extensive regulatory scrutiny including under the federal reserve board’s ccar process and because cet1 is used in calculating riskbased capital ratios we may not be able to consummate the capital initiatives required to bring our cet1 ratio in line with our expectations this could prevent us from achieving our rotce targets for more information about risks relating to our ability to obtain the requisite approval from the federal reserve board see “—supervisory requirements and expectations on us as a financial holding company and a bank holding company our need to make improvements and devote resources to various aspects of our controls processes policies and procedures and any regulatorimposed limits on our activities could limit our ability to implement our strategic plan expand our business improve our financial performance and make capital distributions to our stockholders” 

rising interest rate environment our earnings are dependent to a large extent on our net interest income which is interest income and fees earned on loans and investments less interest paid on deposits and other borrowings net interest income growth has been challenged by the relatively persistent low interest rate environment which continued through 2014 and is continuing into 2015 our strategic plan includes assumptions about rising interest rates in the coming periods however interest rates are highly sensitive to numerous factors which are beyond the control of our management and they have not in recent periods increased in line with our expectations if the current low interest rate environment were to continue or if interest rates do not rise as much or as quickly as we expect then we may not be able to achieve our rotce or other targets for further information about our interest rate sensitivity see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — risk governance and market risk” in part ii item 7 included elsewhere in this report 

in addition to the four principal elements of our strategic plan we also anticipate that our rotce will be affected by a number of additional factors we anticipate a benefit to our rotce from runoff of our noncore portfolio and existing payfixed interest rate swaps which we expect will be offset by the negative impact on our rotce of some deterioration in the credit environment as they return to historical levels and a decline in gains on investments in securities we do not control many aspects of these factors or others and actual results could differ from our expectations materially which could impair our ability to achieve our strategic rotce goals

supervisory requirements and expectations on us as a financial holding company and a bank holding company our need to make improvements and devote resources to various aspects of our controls processes policies and procedures and any regulatorimposed limits on our activities could limit our ability to implement our strategic plan expand our business improve our financial performance and make capital distributions to our stockholders 

as a result of and in addition to new legislation aimed at regulatory reform such as the doddfrank act and the increased capital and liquidity requirements introduced by the us implementation of the basel iii framework the capital components of which have become effective the federal banking agencies the federal reserve board the occ and the fdic as well as the cfpb generally are taking a more stringent approach to supervising and regulating financial institutions and financial products and services over which they exercise their respective supervisory authorities we our two banking subsidiaries and our products and services are all subject to greater supervisory scrutiny and enhanced supervisory requirements and expectations and face significant challenges in meeting them we expect to continue to face greater supervisory scrutiny and enhanced supervisory requirements in the foreseeable future 

our two banking subsidiaries are currently subject to consent orders issued by the occ and the fdic in connection with their findings of deceptive marketing and implementation of some of our checking account and funds transfer products and services among other things the consent orders require us to remedy deficiencies and develop stronger compliance controls policies and procedures we have made progress and continue to make progress in addressing these requirements but the consent orders remain in place and we are unable to predict when they may be terminated cbna is also making improvements to its compliance management systems fair lending compliance risk management deposit reconciliation practices and overdraft fees in order to address deficiencies in those areas cbpa is making improvements to address deficiencies in its deposit reconciliation practices overdraft fees identity theft addon products thirdparty payment processor activities oversight of thirdparty service providers compliance program policies procedures and training consumer complaints process and antimoney laundering controls these efforts require us to make investments in additional resources and systems and also require a significant commitment of managerial time and attention 

in march 2014 the occ communicated its determination that cbna does not meet the condition—namely that cbna must be both well capitalized and well managed as those terms are defined in applicable regulations based on certain minimum capital ratios and supervisory ratings respectively necessary to own a financial subsidiary a financial subsidiary is permitted to engage in a broader range of activities similar to those of a financial holding company than those permissible for a national bank itself cbna has two financial subsidiaries citizens securities inc a registered brokerdealer and rbs citizens insurance agency inc a dormant entity although it continues to collect commissions on certain outstanding insurance policies cbna has entered into an agreement with the occ the “occ agreement” pursuant to which it must develop a remediation plan which must be submitted to the occ setting forth the specific actions it will take to bring itself back into compliance with the condition to own a financial subsidiary and the schedule for achieving that objective until cbna addresses the deficiencies to the occ’s satisfaction cbna will be subject to restrictions on its ability to acquire control of or hold an interest in any new financial subsidiary and to commence new activities in any existing financial subsidiary without the prior approval of the occ the occ agreement provides that if cbna fails to remediate the deficiencies it may have to divest itself of its financial subsidiaries and comply with any additional limitations or conditions on its conduct as the occ may impose cbna has developed a plan to address the deficiencies and has implemented a comprehensive enterprisewide program through which we believe many deficiencies have been addressed 

in march 2014 the federal reserve board objected on qualitative grounds to our capital plan submitted as part of the ccar process in its public report entitled “comprehensive capital analysis and review 2014 assessment framework and results” the federal reserve board cited significant deficiencies in our capital planning processes including inadequate governance weak internal controls and deficiencies in our practices for estimating revenues and losses under a stress scenario and for ensuring the appropriateness of loss estimates across our business lines in a specific stress scenario although the federal reserve board acknowledged that bank holding companies such as ours that are new to the ccar process are subject to different expectations our weaknesses were considered serious enough to warrant the federal reserve board’s objection based on its qualitative assessment of our capital planning process as a result we are not permitted to increase our capital distributions above 2013 levels until a new capital plan is approved by the federal reserve board we submitted a new capital plan on january 5 2015 we cannot assure you that the federal reserve board will not object to that capital plan or that even if it does not object to it our planned capital distributions will not be significantly modified from 2013 levels 

we are also required to make improvements to our overall compliance and operational risk management programs and practices in order to comply with enhanced supervisory requirements and expectations and to address weaknesses in retail credit risk management liquidity risk management model risk management outsourcing and vendor risk management and related oversight and monitoring practices and tools our and our banking subsidiaries’ consumer compliance program and controls also

require improvement particularly with respect to deposit reconciliation processes fair lending and mortgage servicing in addition to all of the foregoing as part of our and our banking subsidiaries’ regular examination process from time to time we and our banking subsidiaries may become and currently are subject to prudential restrictions on our activities the restrictions that apply to cbna are described above similarly under the bank holding company act currently we may not be able to engage in certain categories of new activities or acquire shares or control of other companies other than in connection with internal reorganizations 

in order to remedy these weaknesses and meet these regulatory and supervisory challenges we need to make substantial improvements to our compliance risk management and other processes systems and controls we expect to continue to dedicate significant resources and managerial time and attention and to make significant investments in enhanced compliance risk management and other processes systems and controls we also expect to make restitution payments to our banking subsidiaries’ customers which could be significant arising from certain of the consumer compliance deficiencies described above and may be required to pay civil money penalties in connection with certain of these deficiencies we have established reserves in respect of these future payments but the amounts that we are ultimately obligated to pay could be in excess of our reserves 

the remediation efforts and other matters described above will increase our operational costs and may limit our ability to implement aspects of our strategic plan or otherwise pursue certain business opportunities moreover if we are unsuccessful in remedying these weaknesses and meeting the enhanced supervisory requirements and expectations that apply to us and our banking subsidiaries we could remain subject to existing restrictions or become subject to additional restrictions on our activities informal nonpublic or formal public supervisory actions or public enforcement actions including the payment of civil money penalties any such actions or restrictions if and in whatever manner imposed would likely increase our costs and could limit our ability to implement our strategic plans and expand our business and as a result could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

a continuation of the current low interest rate environment or subsequent movements in interest rates may have an adverse effect on our profitability 

net interest income historically has been and in the neartomedium term we anticipate that it will remain a significant component of our total revenue this is due to the fact that a high percentage of our assets and liabilities have been and will likely continue to be in the form of interestbearing or interestrelated instruments our net interest income was 33 billion for the year ended december 31 2014  and 31 billion for the year ended december 31 2013  changes in interest rates can have a material effect on many areas of our business including the following 

net interest income in recent years it has been the policy of the federal reserve board and the us treasury to maintain interest rates at historically low levels through its targeted federal funds rate and the purchase of us treasury and mortgagebacked securities as a result yields on securities we have purchased and market rates on the loans we have originated have been at levels lower than were available prior to 2008 consequently the average yield on our interestearning assets has decreased during the low interest rate environment if a low interest rate environment persists our net interest income may further decrease this would be the case because our ability to lower our interest expense has been limited at these interest rate levels while the average yield on our interestearning assets has continued to decrease moreover as interest rates begin to increase if our floating rate interestearning assets do not reprice faster than our interestbearing liabilities in a rising rate environment our net interest income could be adversely affected if our net interest income decreases this could have an adverse effect on our profitability 

deposit costs as interest rates increase our net interest margin would narrow if our cost of funding increases without a correlative increase in the interest we earn from loans and investments because we rely extensively on deposits to fund our operations our cost of funding would increase if there is an increase in the interest rate we are required to pay our customers to retain their deposits this could occur for instance if we are faced with competitive pressures to increase rates on deposits in addition if the interest rates we are required to pay for other sources of funding for example in the interbank or capital markets increases our cost of funding would increase if any of the foregoing risks occurs our net interest margin could narrow although our assets currently reprice faster than our liabilities which would result in a benefit to net interest income as interest rates rise the benefit from rising rates could be less than we assume which may have an adverse effect on our profitability 

loan volume and delinquency increases in interest rates may decrease customer demand for loans as the higher cost of obtaining credit may deter customers from seeking new loans further higher interest rates might also lead to an increased number of delinquent loans and defaults which would affect the value of our loans 

value of our mortgage servicing rights as a residential mortgage servicer we have a portfolio of mortgage servicing rights “msrs” msrs are subject to interest rate risk in that their fair value will fluctuate as a result of changes in the interest rate environment when interest rates fall borrowers are generally more likely to prepay their mortgage loans by refinancing them 

 29 

citizens financial group inc 

risk factors 

at a lower rate as the likelihood of prepayment increases the fair value of msrs can decrease a decrease in the fair value below the carrying value of msrs will reduce earnings in the period in which the decrease occurs 

we cannot control or predict with certainty changes in interest rates global national regional and local economic conditions competitive pressures and the policies of regulatory authorities including monetary policies of the federal reserve board affect interest income and interest expense although we have policies and procedures designed to manage the risks associated with changes in market interest rates as further discussed under “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — risk governance” in part ii item 7 included elsewhere in this report changes in interest rates still may have an adverse effect on our profitability 

if our assumptions regarding borrower behavior are wrong or overall economic conditions are significantly different than we anticipate then our risk mitigation may be insufficient to protect against interest rate risk and our net income would be adversely affected 

we could fail to attract retain or motivate highly skilled and qualified personnel including our senior management other key employees or members of our board which could impair our ability to successfully execute our strategic plan and otherwise adversely affect our business 

a key cornerstone of our strategic plan involves the hiring of a large number of highly skilled and qualified personnel accordingly our ability to implement our strategic plan and our future success depends on our ability to attract retain and motivate highly skilled and qualified personnel including our senior management and other key employees and directors competitively with our peers the marketplace for skilled personnel is becoming more competitive which means the cost of hiring incentivizing and retaining skilled personnel may continue to increase the failure to attract or retain including as a result of an untimely death or illness of key personnel or replace a sufficient number of appropriately skilled and key personnel could place us at a significant competitive disadvantage and prevent us from successfully implementing our strategy which could impair our ability to implement our strategic plan successfully achieve our performance targets and otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

governmental scrutiny with respect to matters relating to compensation and other business practices in the financial services industry has increased dramatically in the past several years and has resulted in more aggressive and intense regulatory supervision and the application and enforcement of more stringent standards for example in june 2010 the federal reserve board and other federal banking regulators jointly issued comprehensive final guidance designed to ensure that incentive compensation policies do not undermine the safety and soundness of banking organizations by encouraging employees to take imprudent risks the recent financial crisis and the current political and public sentiment regarding financial institutions has resulted in a significant amount of adverse press coverage as well as adverse statements or charges by regulators and elected officials future legislation or regulation or government views on compensation may result in us altering compensation practices in ways that could adversely affect our ability to attract and retain talented employees 

in addition to complying with us laws relating to compensation we are also required to comply with certain united kingdom “uk” and european union “eu” remuneration requirements for so long as the uk prudential regulation authority “pra” considers rbs group to control us as a result of the implementation of the eu capital requirements directive iv “crd iv” certain of our most senior employees including our ceo may not receive variable compensation in excess of 100 of fixed compensation up to 200 with shareholder approval starting with performance year 2014  because shareholder approval was not sought by rbs a 100 limitation applied for 2014  and will continue to apply until crd iv no longer applies to us we intend to maintain competitive total compensation levels for affected employees although it is possible that the structure of our compensation packages may not be considered in line with our peers 

our ability to meet our obligations and the cost of funds to do so depend on our ability to access sources of liquidity and the particular sources available to us 

liquidity risk is the risk that we will not be able to meet our obligations including funding commitments as they come due this risk is inherent in our operations and can be heightened by a number of factors including an overreliance on a particular source of funding including for example shortterm and overnight funding changes in credit ratings or marketwide phenomena such as market dislocation and major disasters like many banking groups our reliance on customer deposits to meet a considerable portion of our funding has grown over recent years and we continue to seek to increase the proportion of our funding represented by customer deposits however these deposits are subject to fluctuation due to certain factors outside our control such as a loss of confidence by customers in us or the banking sector generally increasing competitive pressures for retail or corporate customer deposits changes in interest rates and returns on other investment classes which could result in a significant outflow of deposits 

 30 

citizens financial group inc 

risk factors 

within a short period of time to the extent that there is heavy competition among us banks for retail customer deposits this competition may increase the cost of procuring new deposits andor retaining existing deposits and otherwise negatively affect our ability to grow our deposit base an inability to grow or any material decrease in our deposits could have a material adverse effect on our ability to satisfy our liquidity needs 

in addition volatility in the interbank funding market can negatively affect our ability to fund our operations for example funding in the interbank markets a traditional source of unsecured shortterm funding was severely disrupted throughout the global economic and financial crisis if market disruption or significant volatility returns to the interbank or wholesale funding market our ability to access liquidity in these funding markets could be materially impaired additionally other factors outside our control such as an operational problem that affects third parties could impair our ability to access market liquidity or create an unforeseen outflow of cash or deposits our inability to access adequate funding whether from bank deposits the interbank funding market or the broader capital markets would constrain our ability to make new loans to meet our existing lending commitments and ultimately jeopardize our overall liquidity and capitalization 

maintaining a diverse and appropriate funding strategy for our assets consistent with our wider strategic risk appetite and plan remains challenging and any tightening of credit markets could have a material adverse impact on us in particular there is a risk that corporate and financial institution counterparties may seek to reduce their credit exposures to banks and other financial institutions for example reflected in reductions in unsecured deposits supplied by these counterparties which may cause funding from these sources to no longer be available under these circumstances we may need to seek funds from alternative sources potentially at higher costs than has previously been the case or may be required to consider disposals of other assets not previously identified for disposal in order to reduce our funding commitments 

a reduction in our credit ratings which are based on a number of factors including the credit ratings of rbs or other members of rbs group could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

credit ratings affect the cost and other terms upon which we are able to obtain funding rating agencies regularly evaluate us and their ratings are based on a number of factors including our financial strength other factors considered by rating agencies include the financial strength of and other factors relating to rbs and rbs group as well as conditions affecting the financial services industry generally any downgrade in our ratings would likely increase our borrowing costs could limit our access to capital markets and otherwise adversely affect our business for example a ratings downgrade could adversely affect our ability to sell or market in the capital markets certain of our securities including longterm debt engage in certain longerterm and derivatives transactions and retain our customers particularly corporate customers who need a minimum rating threshold in order to place funds with us in addition under the terms of certain of our derivatives contracts we may be required to maintain a minimum credit rating or have to post additional collateral or terminate such contracts any of these results of a rating downgrade could increase our cost of funding reduce our liquidity and have adverse effects on our business financial condition and results of operations 

any downgrade in the credit rating of rbs or other members of rbs group may negatively impact the rating agencies’ evaluation of us and our business which could ultimately result in a downgrade of our credit ratings the credit ratings of rbs and other members of rbs group along with a number of other european financial institutions were downgraded during the course of the last four years as part of the rating agencies’ rating methodology changes review of systemic support assumptions incorporated into bank ratings and the likelihood in the case of banks located in the united kingdom that the uk government is more likely in the future to make greater use of its regulatory tools to allow burden sharing among bank creditors rating agencies continue to evaluate the rating methodologies applicable to european financial institutions including rbs and other members of rbs group and any change in such methodologies could ultimately affect our credit ratings separately adverse changes in the credit ratings of the united kingdom could adversely affect the credit ratings of rbs or other members of rbs group which may ultimately have an adverse impact on our credit ratings

we are subject to certain risks related to originating and selling mortgages and we may be required to repurchase mortgage loans or indemnify mortgage loan purchasers which could adversely impact our business financial condition and results of operations 

we originate and often sell mortgage loans when we sell mortgage loans whether as whole loans or pursuant to a securitization we are required to make customary representations and warranties to the purchaser about the mortgage loans and the manner in which they were originated our loan sale agreements require us to repurchase or substitute mortgage loans in the event of certain breaches of these representations or warranties in addition we may be required to repurchase mortgage loans as a result of borrower fraud or in the event of early payment default of the borrower on a mortgage loan likewise we are required to repurchase or substitute mortgage loans if we breach certain representations or warranties in connection with our securitizations whether or not we were the originator of the loan while in many cases we may have a remedy available against certain parties often these may not be as broad as the remedies available to a purchaser of mortgage loans against us and we face the further risk that such parties may not have the financial capacity to satisfy remedies that may be available to us therefore if a purchaser enforces its remedies against us we may not be able to recover our losses from third parties we have received repurchase and indemnity demands from purchasers in the past which have resulted in an increase in the amount of losses for repurchases in particular between the start of 2009 and december 31 2014  we received approximately 158 million in repurchase demands and 99 million in indemnification payment requests in respect of loans originated for the most part since 2003 of those claims presented 88 million was paid to repurchase residential mortgages and 33 million was incurred for indemnification costs to make investors whole we repurchased mortgage loans totaling 25 million and 35 million for the years ended december 31 2014  and 2013  respectively we incurred indemnification costs of 8 million and 12 million for the years ended december 31 2014  and 2013  respectively we responded to subpoenas issued by the office of the inspector general for the federal housing authority agency in december 2013 which requested information about loans sold to the federal national mortgage association and the federal home loan mortgage corporation from 2003 to 2011 we cannot estimate what the future level of repurchase demands will be or our ultimate exposure and cannot give any assurance that the historical experience will or will not continue in the future the volume of repurchase demands may increase which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we face risks as a servicer of loans we may be terminated as a servicer or master servicer be required to repurchase a mortgage loan or reimburse investors for credit losses on a mortgage loan or incur costs liabilities fines and other sanctions if we fail to satisfy our servicing obligations including our obligations with respect to mortgage loan foreclosure actions 

we act as servicer or master servicer for mortgage loans included in securitizations and for unsecuritized mortgage loans owned by investors as a servicer or master servicer for those loans we have certain contractual obligations to the securitization trusts investors or other third parties including in our capacity as a servicer foreclosing on defaulted mortgage loans or to the extent consistent with the applicable securitization or other investor agreement considering alternatives to foreclosure such as loan modifications short sales and deedinlieu of foreclosures and in our capacity as a master servicer overseeing the servicing of mortgage loans by the servicer generally our servicing obligations as a servicer or master servicer described above are set by contract for which we receive a contractual fee however the costs to perform contractedfor services have been increasing which reduces our profitability in addition we serve as a servicer for government sponsored enterprises “gses” under servicing guides the gses can amend their servicing guides which can increase the scope or costs of the services we are required to perform without any corresponding increase in our servicing fee further the cfpb has issued two regulations that amended the mortgage servicing provisions of regulation z and regulation x which became effective on january 10 2014 and which may further increase the scope and costs of services we are required to perform including as it relates to servicing loans that we own in addition there has been a significant increase in state laws that impose additional servicing requirements that increase the scope and cost of our servicing obligations

if we commit a material breach of our obligations as servicer or master servicer we may be subject to termination if the breach is not cured within a specified period of time following notice which can generally be given by the securitization trustee or a specified percentage of security holders causing us to lose servicing income in addition we may be required to indemnify the securitization trustee against losses from any failure by us as a servicer or master servicer to perform our servicing obligations or any act or omission on our part that involves willful misfeasance bad faith or gross negligence for certain investors andor certain transactions we may be contractually obligated to repurchase a mortgage loan or reimburse the investor for credit losses incurred on the loan as a remedy for servicing errors with respect to the loan if we experience increased repurchase obligations because of claims that we did not satisfy our obligations as a servicer or master servicer or increased loss severity on such repurchases we may have to materially increase our repurchase reserve 

we rely on the mortgage secondary market and gses for some of our liquidity 

we sell some of the mortgage loans we originate to reduce our credit risk and to provide funding for additional loans we rely on gses to purchase loans that meet their conforming loan requirements strategically we may originate and hold nonconforming loans onbalance sheet for investment purposes or from time to time we will rely on other capital markets investors to purchase nonconforming loans ie loans that do not meet gse requirements a viable consistent outlet for nonconforming loans continues to be a challenge that has impacted the liquidity in this space retaining nonconforming loans on balance sheet is a trend that continues when we retain a loan not only do we keep the credit risk of the loan but we also do not receive any sale proceeds that could be used to generate new loans however we receive net interest margin as our income stream as loan payments are received on a monthly basis in lieu of sale proceeds depending on balance sheet capacity a persistent lack of liquidity could limit our ability to fund and thus originate new mortgage loans reducing the fees we earn from originating and servicing loans in addition we cannot provide assurance that gses will not materially limit their purchases of conforming loans due to capital constraints or change their criteria for conforming loans eg maximum loan amount or borrower eligibility we note that proposals have been presented to reform the housing finance market in the united states including the role of the gses in the housing finance market the extent and timing of any such regulatory reform regarding the housing finance market and the gses as well as any effect on our business and financial results are uncertain 

we are subject to increased risk of credit losses associated with helocs originated prior to the global financial and economic crisis 

during the years prior to the global financial and economic crisis financial institutions including us originated a significant number of helocs the terms of helocs generally provided for the deferral of borrowers’ obligations to begin to repay principal until a specified future date as of december 31 2014  approximately 29 of our 160 billion heloc portfolio or 46 billion in drawn balances and 38 billion in undrawn balances were subject to a payment reset or balloon payment between january 1 2015 and december 31 2017 including 245 million in balloon balances where full payment is due at the end of a tenyear interestonly draw period although we launched a program in september 2013 to manage the exposure by providing heightened outreach to borrowers there remains a risk of increased credit losses as borrowers become obligated to make principal and interest payments for further information regarding the expected heloc payment shock see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — key factors affecting our business — heloc payment shock” in part ii item 7 included elsewhere in this report 

our financial performance may be adversely affected by deterioration in borrower credit quality particularly in the new england midatlantic and midwest regions where our operations are concentrated 

we have exposure to many different industries and risks arising from actual or perceived changes in credit quality and uncertainty over the recoverability of amounts due from borrowers is inherent in our businesses our exposure may be exacerbated by the geographic concentration of our operations which are predominately located in the new england midatlantic and midwest regions the credit quality of our borrowers may deteriorate for a number of reasons that are outside our control including as a result of prevailing economic and market conditions and asset valuation the trends and risks affecting borrower credit quality particularly in the new england midatlantic and midwest regions have caused and in the future may cause us to experience impairment charges increased repurchase demands higher costs additional writedowns and losses and an inability to engage in routine funding transactions which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

our framework for managing risks may not be effective in mitigating risk and loss and our use of models presents risks to our risk management framework 

our risk management framework is made up of various processes and strategies to manage our risk exposure the framework to manage risk including the framework’s underlying assumptions may not be effective under all conditions and circumstances if the risk management framework proves ineffective we could suffer unexpected losses and could be materially adversely affected 

one of the main types of risks inherent in our business is credit risk an important feature of our credit risk management system is to employ an internal credit risk control system through which we identify measure monitor and mitigate existing and emerging credit risk of our customers as this process involves detailed analyses of the customer or credit risk taking into account both quantitative and qualitative factors it is subject to human error in exercising their judgment our employees may not always be able to assign an accurate credit rating to a customer or credit risk which may result in our exposure to higher credit risks than indicated by our risk rating system 

in addition we have undertaken a strategic initiative to enhance our credit policies and guidelines to address potential risks associated with particular industries or types of customers as discussed in more detail under “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — risk governance and market risk” in part ii item 7 included elsewhere in this report however we may not be able to effectively implement these initiatives or consistently follow and refine our credit risk management system if any of the foregoing were to occur it may result in an increase in the level of nonperforming loans and a higher risk exposure for us which could have a material adverse effect on us 

some of our tools and metrics for managing risk are based upon our use of observed historical market behavior we rely on quantitative models to measure risks and to estimate certain financial values models may be used in such processes as determining the pricing of various products grading loans and extending credit measuring interest rate and other market risks predicting losses assessing capital adequacy and calculating regulatory capital levels as well as estimating the value of financial instruments and balance sheet items poorly designed or implemented models present the risk that our business decisions based on information incorporating such models will be adversely affected due to the inadequacy of that information moreover our models may fail to predict future risk exposures if the information used in the model is incorrect obsolete or not sufficiently comparable to actual events as they occur we seek to incorporate appropriate historical data in our models but the range of market values and behaviors reflected in any period of historical data is not at all times predictive of future developments in any particular period and the period of data we incorporate into our models may turn out to be inappropriate for the future period being modeled in such case our ability to manage risk would be limited and our risk exposure and losses could be significantly greater than our models indicated for example we experienced certain technical issues relating to our market risk measurement processes when we began incorporating trade level detail for foreign exchange contracts in 2013 despite rigorous pilot testing of our processes during the initial phase of implementation our processes failed to incorporate certain positions we maintained to offset client exposure which led to an immaterial overstatement of foreign exchange currency rate risk positions during 2013 compared to our position at year end we have adjusted our processes and have experienced no further issues in addition if existing or potential customers believe our risk management is inadequate they could take their business elsewhere this could harm our reputation as well as our revenues and profits finally information we provide to our regulators based on poorly designed or implemented models could also be inaccurate or misleading some of the decisions that our regulators make including those related to capital distributions to our stockholders could be affected adversely due to their perception that the quality of the models used to generate the relevant information is insufficient 

the preparation of our financial statements requires the use of estimates that may vary from actual results particularly various factors may cause our allowance for loan and lease losses to increase 

the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america “gaap” requires management to make significant estimates that affect the financial statements our most critical accounting estimate is the allowance for loan and lease losses the allowance for loan and lease losses is a reserve established through a provision for loan and lease losses charged to expense and represents our estimate of losses within the existing portfolio of loans the allowance is necessary to reserve for estimated loan and lease losses and risks inherent in the loan portfolio the level of the allowance reflects our ongoing evaluation of industry concentrations specific credit risks loan and lease loss experience current loan portfolio quality present economic political and regulatory conditions and incurred losses inherent in the current loan portfolio 

the determination of the appropriate level of the allowance for loan and lease losses inherently involves a degree of subjectivity and requires that we make significant estimates of current credit risks and future trends all of which may undergo

material changes changes in economic conditions affecting borrowers the stagnation of certain economic indicators that we are more susceptible to such as unemployment and real estate values new information regarding existing loans identification of additional problem loans and other factors both within and outside our control may require an increase in the allowance for loan and lease losses in addition bank regulatory agencies periodically review our allowance for loan and lease losses and may require an increase in the allowance for loan and lease losses or the recognition of further loan chargeoffs based on judgments that can differ from those of our own management in addition if chargeoffs in future periods exceed the allowance for loan and lease losses—that is if the allowance for loan and lease losses is inadequate—we will need additional loan and lease loss provisions to increase the allowance for loan and lease losses should such additional provisions become necessary they would result in a decrease in net income and capital and may have a material adverse effect on us 

we could also sustain credit losses that are significantly higher than the amount of our allowance for loan and lease losses and therefore have an adverse impact on earnings higher credit losses could arise for a variety of reasons a severe downturn in the economy would generate increased chargeoffs and a need for higher reserves in particular a severe decrease in housing prices or spike in unemployment would cause higher losses and a larger allowance for loan and lease losses particularly in the residential real estate secured portfolios within the residential real estate portfolios we have helocs for which the end of draw is happening over the next two years if there is a spike in interest rates these customers will not only have to deal with an increased or first time principal payment but also an increase in interest payments potentially leading to larger losses and allowance for loan and lease losses for more information about risks related to helocs see “—we are subject to increased risk of credit losses associated with helocs originated prior to the global financial and economic crisis” and “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — key factors affecting our business — heloc payment shock” in part ii item 7 included elsewhere in this report while we believe that our allowance for loan and lease losses was adequate on december 31 2014  there is no assurance that it will be sufficient to cover all incurred loan and lease credit losses particularly if economic conditions worsen in the event of deterioration in economic conditions we may be required to increase reserves in future periods which would reduce our earnings 

the value of certain financial instruments recorded at fair value is determined using financial models incorporating assumptions judgments and estimates that may change over time or may ultimately not turn out to be accurate 

under gaap we recognize at fair value i financial instruments classified as held for trading or designated at fair value through profit or loss ii financial assets classified as available for sale “afs” and iii derivatives generally to establish the fair value of these instruments we rely on quoted market prices if such market prices are not available we rely on internal valuation models that utilize observable market data andor independent thirdparty pricing for example observable market data may not be available for certain individual financial instruments or classes of financial instruments such as venture capital investments in such circumstances we utilize complex internal valuation models to establish fair value these models require us to make assumptions judgments and estimates regarding matters that are inherently uncertain when practical we supplement internal models using independent price verification in order to lessen the uncertainties in our models these assumptions judgments and estimates are periodically updated to reflect changing facts trends and market conditions the resulting change in the fair values of the financial instruments may have a material adverse effect on our earnings and financial condition 

operational risks are inherent in our businesses 

our operations depend on our ability to process a very large number of transactions efficiently and accurately while complying with applicable laws and regulations operational risk and losses can result from internal and external fraud errors by employees or third parties failure to document transactions properly or to obtain proper authorization failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements and conduct of business rules equipment failures including those caused by natural disasters or by electrical telecommunications or other essential utility outages business continuity and data security system failures including those caused by computer viruses cyberattacks or unforeseen problems encountered while implementing major new computer systems or upgrades to existing systems or the inadequacy or failure of systems and controls including those of our suppliers or counterparties although we have implemented risk controls and loss mitigation actions and substantial resources are devoted to developing efficient procedures identifying and rectifying weaknesses in existing procedures and training staff it is not possible to be certain that such actions have been or will be effective in controlling each of the operational risks faced by us any weakness in these systems or controls or any breaches or alleged breaches of such laws or regulations could result in increased regulatory supervision enforcement actions and other disciplinary action and have an adverse impact on our business applicable authorizations and licenses reputation and results of operations

the financial services industry including the banking sector is undergoing rapid technological changes as a result of competition and changes in the legal and regulatory framework and we may not be able to compete effectively as a result of these changes 

the financial services industry including the banking sector is continually undergoing rapid technological change with frequent introductions of new technologydriven products and services in addition new unexpected technological changes could have a disruptive effect on the way banks offer products and services we believe our success depends to a great extent on our ability to use technology to offer products and services that provide convenience to customers and to create additional efficiencies in our operations however we may not be able to among other things keep up with the rapid pace of technological changes effectively implement new technologydriven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to our customers as a result our ability to compete effectively to attract or retain new business may be impaired and our business financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected 

in addition changes in the legal and regulatory framework under which we operate require us to update our information systems to ensure compliance our need to review and evaluate the impact of ongoing rule proposals final rules and implementation guidance from regulators further complicates the development and implementation of new information systems for our business also recent regulatory guidance has focused on the need for financial institutions to perform increased due diligence and ongoing monitoring of thirdparty vendor relationships thus increasing the scope of management involvement and decreasing the efficiency otherwise resulting from our relationships with thirdparty technology providers given the significant number of ongoing regulatory reform initiatives it is possible that we incur higher than expected information technology costs in order to comply with current and impending regulations see “—supervisory requirements and expectations on us as a financial holding company and a bank holding company  our need to make improvements and devote resources to various aspects of our controls processes policies and procedures and any regulatorimposed limits on our activities could limit our ability to implement our strategic plan expand our business   improve our financial performance and make capital distributions to our stockholders” 

cyberattacks distributed denial of service attacks and other cybersecurity matters if successful could adversely affect how we conduct our business 

we are under continuous threat of loss due to cyberattacks especially as we continue to expand customer capabilities to utilize the internet and other remote channels to transact business two of the most significant cyberattack risks that we face are efraud and loss of sensitive customer data loss from efraud occurs when cybercriminals extract funds directly from customers’ or our accounts using fraudulent schemes that may include internetbased funds transfers we have been subject to a number of efraud incidents historically we have also been subject to attempts to steal sensitive customer data such as account numbers and social security numbers through unauthorized access to our computer systems including computer hacking such attacks are less frequent but could present significant reputational legal and regulatory costs to us if successful 

recently there has been a series of distributed denial of service attacks on financial services companies including us distributed denial of service attacks are designed to saturate the targeted online network with excessive amounts of network traffic resulting in slow response times or in some cases causing the site to be temporarily unavailable generally these attacks are conducted to interrupt or suspend a company’s access to internet service the attacks can adversely affect the performance of a company’s website and in some instances prevent customers from accessing a company’s website we are implementing certain technology protections such as customer profiling and stepup authentication to be in compliance with the federal financial institutions examination council “ffiec” authentication in internet banking environment “aibe” guidelines however potential cyber threats that include hacking and other attempts to breach information technology security controls are rapidly evolving and we may not be able to anticipate or prevent all such attacks in the event that a cyberattack is successful our business financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected 

we rely heavily on communications and information systems to conduct our business 

we rely heavily on communications and information systems to conduct our business any failure interruption or breach in security of these systems including due to hacking or other similar attempts to breach information technology security protocols could result in failures or disruptions in our customer relationship management general ledger deposit loan and other systems although we have established policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the effect of the possible failure interruption or security breach of our information systems there can be no assurance that these policies and procedures will be successful and that any such failure interruption or security breach will not occur or if they do occur that they will be adequately addressed the occurrence of any failure interruption or security breach of our information systems could damage our reputation result in a loss of customer business subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny or expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability

we rely on third parties for the performance of a significant portion of our information technology 

we rely on third parties for the performance of a significant portion of our information technology functions and the provision of information technology and business process services for example i certain components and services relating to our online banking system rely on data communications networks operated by unaffiliated third parties ii many of our applications are hosted or maintained by third parties including our commercial loan system which is hosted and maintained by automated financial systems inc and iii our core deposits system is maintained by fidelity information services inc the success of our business depends in part on the continuing ability of these and other third parties to perform these functions and services in a timely and satisfactory manner if we experience a disruption in the provision of any functions or services performed by third parties we may have difficulty in finding alternate providers on terms favorable to us and in reasonable timeframes if these services are not performed in a satisfactory manner we would not be able to serve our customers well in either situation our business could incur significant costs and be adversely affected 

we are exposed to reputational risk and the risk of damage to our brands and the brands of our affiliates including rbs group 

our success and results depend in part on our reputation and the strength of our brands we are vulnerable to adverse market perception as we operate in an industry where integrity customer trust and confidence are paramount we are exposed to the risk that litigation employee misconduct operational failures the outcome of regulatory or other investigations or actions press speculation and negative publicity among other factors could damage our brands or reputation our brands and reputation could also be harmed if we sell products or services that do not perform as expected or customers’ expectations for the product are not satisfied 

negative publicity could result for example from an allegation or determination that we have failed to comply with regulatory or legislative requirements from failure in business continuity or performance of our information technology systems loss of customer data or confidential information fraudulent activities unsatisfactory service and support levels or insufficient transparency or disclosure of information negative publicity adversely affecting our brands or reputation could also result from misconduct or malpractice by partners or other third parties with whom we have relationships in particular because of our relationship with rbs group negative publicity about rbs group could have a negative effect on us adverse publicity governmental scrutiny any pending future investigations by regulators or law enforcement agencies involving us any of our affiliates or rbs group can also have a negative impact on our reputation and business which could adversely affect our results of operations 

any damage to our brands or reputation could cause existing customers or other third parties to terminate their business relationships with us and potential customers or other third parties to be reluctant to do business with us such damage to our brands or reputation could cause disproportionate damage to our business even if the negative publicity is factually inaccurate or unfounded furthermore negative publicity could result in greater regulatory scrutiny and influence market or rating agencies’ perceptions of us which could make it more difficult for us to maintain our credit rating the occurrence of any of these events could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we may be adversely affected by unpredictable catastrophic events or terrorist attacks and our business continuity and disaster recovery plans may not adequately protect us from serious disaster 

the occurrence of catastrophic events such as hurricanes tropical storms tornadoes and other largescale catastrophes and terrorist attacks could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations if a catastrophe rendered both our production data center in rhode island and our recovery data center in massachusetts unusable the distance between the data center locations approximately 45 miles provides diversity in resources but not sufficient diversity in the event of a catastrophe as described above although we are building a new outofregion backup data center in north carolina scheduled for completion in 2015 we do not currently have a backup data center outside new england 

our principal communications and information systems are housed in the rhode island primary data center and our operations are concentrated in the new england midatlantic and midwest regions if a natural disaster severe weather power outage or other event were to occur in new england or if we were subject to a terrorist attack prior to the opening of the north carolina recovery data center that prevented us from using all or a significant portion of our communications and information systems damaged critical infrastructure or otherwise disrupted our operations it may be difficult or in certain cases impossible for us to continue our business for a substantial period of time although we have implemented disaster recovery and business continuity plans these plans may prove inadequate in the event of a disaster or similar event that seriously compromises our information systems we may incur substantial expenses as a result of any limitations relating to our disaster recovery and business

continuity plans which particularly when taken together with the geographic concentration of our operations could have a material adverse effect on our business 

an inability to realize the value of our deferred tax assets could adversely affect operating results 

our net deferred tax assets “dtas” are subject to an evaluation of whether it is more likely than not that they will be realized for financial statement purposes in making this determination we consider all positive and negative evidence available including the impact of recent operating results as well as potential carryback of tax to prior years’ taxable income reversals of existing taxable temporary differences tax planning strategies and projected earnings within the statutory tax loss carryover period we have determined that the dtas are more likely than not to be realized at december 31 2014  except for 157 million related to state dtas for which a valuation allowance was established if we were to conclude that a significant portion of the dtas were not more likely than not to be realized the required valuation allowance could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

we maintain a significant investment in projects that generate tax credits which we may not be able to fully utilize or if utilized may be subject to recapture or restructuring 

at december 31 2014  we maintained an investment of approximately 399 million in entities for which we receive allocations of tax credits which we utilize to offset our taxable income we accrued 26 million and 14 million in credits for the years ended december 31 2014  and december 31 2013  respectively as of december 31 2014  all tax credits have been utilized to offset taxable income substantially all of these tax credits are related to development projects that are subject to ongoing compliance requirements over certain periods of time to fully realize their value if these projects are not operated in full compliance with the required terms the tax credits could be subject to recapture or restructuring further we may not be able to utilize any future tax credits if we are unable to utilize our tax credits or if our tax credits are subject to recapture or restructuring it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we may have exposure to greater than anticipated tax liabilities 

the tax laws applicable to our business activities including the laws of the united states and other jurisdictions are subject to interpretation the taxing authorities in the jurisdictions in which we operate may challenge our tax positions which could increase our effective tax rate and harm our financial position and results of operations in addition our future income taxes could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions that have lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions that have higher statutory tax rates or by changes in tax laws regulations or accounting principles we are subject to regular review and audit by us federal and state tax authorities any adverse outcome of such a review or audit could have a negative effect on our financial position and results of operations in addition the determination of our provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires significant judgment by management although we believe that our estimates are reasonable the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements and may materially affect our financial results in the period or periods for which such determination is made 

if we are unable to implement and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting in the future investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and the market price of our common stock may be negatively affected 

we are required to maintain internal controls over financial reporting and to report any material weaknesses in such internal controls as a public company we are currently subject to the requirements of the sarbanesoxley act and as a us bank holding company we are also subject to the fdic part 363 annual report rules which incorporate certain items from the sarbanesoxley act section 404 into the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of 1991 “fdicia” requirements in addition beginning with our second annual report on form 10k we will be required to furnish a report by management on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act our independent registered public accounting firm is required to express an opinion as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting beginning with our second annual report on form 10k the process of designing implementing and testing the internal control over financial reporting required to comply with this obligation is timeconsuming costly and complicated if we identify material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting if we are unable to comply with the requirements of section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act in a timely manner or to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to express an opinion as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and the market price of our common stock could be negatively affected and we could become subject to civil lawsuits filed by investors or

investigations by the stock exchange on which our securities are listed the sec or other regulatory authorities which could require additional financial and management resources 

we depend on the accuracy and completeness of information about clients and counterparties 

in deciding whether to extend credit or enter into other transactions with clients and counterparties we rely on information furnished by or on behalf of clients and counterparties including financial statements and other financial information we also may rely on representations of clients and counterparties as to the accuracy and completeness of that information and with respect to financial statements on reports of independent auditors if any of such information is incorrect then the creditworthiness of our clients and counterparties may be misrepresented which would increase our credit risk and expose us to possible writedowns and losses 

we may not be able to successfully manage our intellectual property and may be subject to infringement claims 

we rely on a combination of owned and licensed trademarks service marks trade names logos and other intellectual property rights third parties may challenge invalidate infringe or misappropriate our intellectual property or such intellectual property may not be sufficient to provide us with competitive advantages which could result in costly redesign efforts discontinuance of certain services or other competitive harm for example words contained in our trademarks and trade names including the word “citizens” are also found in the trade names of a significant number of third parties including other banks this has resulted in and may in the future result in challenges to our ability to use our trademarks and trade names in particular geographical areas or lines of business such challenges could impede our future expansion into new geographic areas or lines of business and could limit our ability to realize the full value of our trademarks and trade names we may have to litigate to enforce or determine the scope and enforceability of our intellectual property rights which is expensive could cause a diversion of resources and may not prove successful existing use by others of trademarks and trade names that are similar to ours could limit our ability to challenge third parties when their use of such marks or names may cause consumer confusion negatively affect consumers’ perception of our brand and products or dilute our brand identity in addition certain aspects of our business and our services rely on technologies and intellectual property licensed by third parties and we may not be able to obtain or continue to obtain licenses and technologies from these third parties on reasonable terms or at all the loss or diminution of our intellectual property protection or the inability to obtain third party intellectual property could harm our business and ability to compete 

we may also be subject to costly litigation in the event our services infringe upon or otherwise violate a third party’s proprietary rights third parties may have or may eventually be granted intellectual property rights including trademarks that could be infringed by our services or other aspects of our business third parties have made and may make claims of infringement against us with respect to our services or business as we continue rebranding cfg and our banking subsidiaries and expand our business the likelihood of receiving third party challenges or claims of infringement related to our intellectual property may increase any claim from third parties may result in a limitation on our ability to use the intellectual property subject to such claims even if we believe that intellectual property related claims are without merit defending against such claims is time consuming and expensive and could result in the diversion of the time and attention of our management and employees claims of intellectual property infringement also might require us to redesign affected services enter into costly settlement or license agreements pay costly damage awards or face a temporary or permanent injunction prohibiting us from marketing or selling certain of our services any intellectual property related dispute or litigation could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

risks related to our relationship with and separation from rbs group 

rbs is our controlling stockholder and its interests may conflict with ours or yours in the future 

as a result of being our controlling stockholder rbs group has significant power to control our affairs and policies including with respect to the election of directors and through the election of directors the appointment of management the entering into of mergers sales of substantially all of our assets and other extraordinary transactions in particular under the separation and shareholder agreement that we entered into with rbs in connection with our initial public offering the “separation agreement” for so long as rbs maintains beneficial ownership of our outstanding common stock in excess of certain thresholds we will be required to obtain the consent of rbs to complete certain significant transactions including our merger or consolidation entrance into joint ventures in excess of certain thresholds or similar corporate transactions issuance of common stock other than pursuant to our equity incentive plans issuance or the guarantee of indebtedness in excess of certain thresholds the termination or appointment of a replacement of our chief executive officer chief financial officer or chief risk officer and certain other significant transactions the interests of rbs group may not align with our or your interests and we may not be able to manage our business in a manner that is in your best interests which could cause the price of our stock to decline

as of december 31 2014  rbs was 791 owned by the uk government and its interests may conflict with ours or yours in the future 

following placing and open offers in december 2008 and in april 2009 her majesty’s treasury “hm treasury” owned approximately 703 of the enlarged ordinary share capital of rbs in december 2009 rbs issued a further £255 billion of new capital to hm treasury this new capital took the form of b shares which do not generally carry voting rights at general meetings of ordinary stockholders but are convertible into ordinary shares following the issuance of the b shares hm treasury’s holding of ordinary shares of the company remained at 703 although its economic interest rose to 844 as of december 31 2014  hm treasury held 623 of the voting rights in rbs and had an economic interest of 791 

hm treasury’s stockholder relationship with rbs is managed on its behalf by uk financial investments limited “ukfi” and although hm treasury has indicated that it intends to respect the commercial decisions of rbs and that rbs will continue to have its own independent board of directors and management team determining its own strategy should its current intentions change hm treasury’s position as a majority stockholder and ukfi’s position as manager of this stockholding means that hm treasury or ukfi may be able to exercise a significant degree of influence over rbs the manner in which hm treasury or ukfi exercises hm treasury’s rights as majority stockholder could give rise to conflict between the interests of hm treasury and the interests of our stockholders and rbs may make decisions impacting our operations and the value of our common stock based on uk policy imperatives rather than traditional stockholder economic considerations we cannot accurately predict whether any restrictions and limitations imposed on rbs on account of hm treasury’s ownership position or the implementation of rbs’s restructuring plan agreed to with hm treasury will have a negative effect on our businesses and financial flexibility or result in conflicts between the interests of rbs and our interests in addition it is difficult for us to predict whether any changes to or termination of hm treasury’s current relationship with rbs will have any effect on our business we also note that we cannot predict the possible effect of rbs not satisfying its commitment to divest cfg as agreed with hm treasury for instance by having a remaining ownership interest in cfg and its subsidiaries beyond any deadline agreed with hm treasury 

rbs group and its uk bank subsidiaries are subject to the provisions of the uk banking act 2009 as amended by the uk financial services banking reform act 2013 which includes special resolution powers including nationalization and bailin 

under the banking act 2009 substantial powers have been granted to uk banking regulators as part of a special resolution regime these powers enable such regulators to deal with and stabilize certain deposittaking uk incorporated institutions that are failing or are likely to fail to satisfy the “fsma threshold conditions” within the meaning of section 41 of the financial services and markets act 2000 “fsma” which are the conditions that a relevant entity must satisfy in order to obtain its authorization to perform regulated activities the special resolution regime consists of three stabilization options i transfer of all or part of the business of the relevant entity andor the securities of the relevant entity to a private sector purchaser ii transfer of all or part of the business of the relevant entity to a “bridge bank” wholly owned by the bank of england and iii temporary public ownership nationalization of the relevant entity if the uk regulators determine that rbs group has failed or is likely to fail to satisfy the fsma threshold conditions then hm treasury could decide to take rbs group into temporary public ownership pursuant to the powers granted under the banking act 2009 and it may then take various actions in relation to any securities without the consent of holders of the securities in each case the uk banking regulators would have the authority to modify contractual arrangements of rbs group and disapply or modify laws with possible retrospective effect to enable their powers under uk law to be used effectively 

among the changes introduced by the financial services banking reform act 2013 the banking act 2009 was amended to insert a bailin option as part of the powers of the uk regulators this option will come into force on such date as shall be stipulated by hm treasury hm treasury has applied the bailin provisions from january 1 2015 which is ahead of the deadline of january 1 2016 that is set out in the european bank recovery and resolution directive “brrd” the bailin option will be introduced as an additional power available to the bank of england to enable it to recapitalize a failed institution by allocating losses first to its shareholders and then to eligible unsecured creditors in a manner that seeks to respect the hierarchy of claims in liquidation the bailin option includes the power to cancel a liability to modify the form of a liability including the power to convert a liability from one form to another or to provide that a contract under which the institution has a liability is to have effect as if a specified right had been exercised under it each for the purposes of reducing deferring or canceling the liabilities of the bank under resolution as well as to transfer a liability the financial services banking reform act 2013 is consistent with the range of tools that european member states will be required to make available to their resolution authorities under the brrd although some amendments are expected to the current uk bailin provisions to ensure that they are fully compliant with the requirements of the brrd

if the uk regulators were to take such stabilization actions with respect to rbs group due to a failure or likely failure by rbs group to satisfy the fsma threshold conditions it could result in the creation modification or canceling of certain of our contractual arrangements that we entered into with rbs group in connection with the completion of our initial public offering including the transitional services agreement and separation agreement in addition the uk regulators could seek to impose additional obligations on us including the provision of services to third parties who may purchase some or all of rbs group’s assets the uk regulators could also materially modify rbs group’s restructuring efforts including the acceleration of its disclosed intention to sell its remaining shares of our common stock any of these actions could have a material adverse effect on our business contractual obligations and the value of our common stock

 our separation from rbs group could adversely affect our business and profitability due to rbs group’s recognizable brand and reputation 

prior to our initial public offering as a wholly owned indirect subsidiary of rbs we marketed our products and services using the “rbs” brand name and logo we believe the association with rbs group has provided us with preferred status among certain of our customers vendors and other persons due to rbs group’s globally recognized brand perceived highquality products and services and strong capital base and financial strength 

our separation from rbs group could adversely affect our ability to attract and retain customers which could result in reduced sales of our products in connection with our initial public offering we entered into a trademark license agreement pursuant to which we were granted a limited license to use certain rbs trademarks including the daisywheel logo for an initial term of five years and at our option up to 10 years we are required under the agreement to remove the “rbs” brand name from all of our products and services by the time rbs beneficially owns less than 50 of our outstanding common stock but in no event earlier than october 1 2015 and we lose the right to use rbs trademarks in connection with the marketing of any product or service once we rebrand and cease using rbs trademarks in connection with such product or service we have changed the legal names of our subsidiaries that included “rbs” and have continued operational and legal work to rebrand cfg and our banking subsidiaries the process of changing all marketing materials operational materials signage systems and legal entities containing “rbs” to our new brand name will take approximately 14 months and cost approximately 14 million excluding any incremental advertising and customer communication expenses we expect to shift the majority of our advertising and marketing budget to our new brand progressively as the different legal entities complete their individual brand name changes we expect the shift in advertising and marketing investment to be completed no later than july 31 2015 as a result of this rebranding some of our existing customers may choose to stop doing business with us which could increase customer withdrawals in addition other potential customers may decide not to purchase our products and services because we no longer will be a part of rbs group we may also receive decreased referrals of business from rbs group our separation from rbs group could prompt some third

we will need to replicate or replace certain functions systems and infrastructure to which we no longer have the same access as we separate from rbs group including services we receive pursuant to the transitional services agreement we will also need to make infrastructure investments in order to operate without the same access to rbs group’s existing operational and administrative infrastructure any failure to successfully implement these initiatives or to do so in a timely manner could have an adverse effect on us 

we expect to make an investment of approximately 18 million in our systems to complete the migration of technological services following our separation from rbs group in particular we will separate our shared global network and where services such as corporate risk back office audit and human resources are being provided by rbs group we will establish those services for cfg these initiatives may not be completed on the expected timetable or within the expected budget and may not provide the system functionality or performance levels required to support the current and future needs of our business further the systems and services provided to us by rbs group under the transitional services agreement will need to be replaced on or before the date of the expiration of the transitional services agreement the terms on which we purchase these new systems and services or the functionality of the systems themselves may be inferior to those of the systems provided by rbs group or those available elsewhere in the market and in relation to thirdparty suppliers may be on terms that are less favorable than the terms on which services were previously provided by third parties to rbs group and from which we have historically benefited and will continue to benefit during the period of the transitional services agreement for more information regarding the transitional services agreement see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in part ii item 7 included elsewhere in this report

any deterioration in national economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our business is affected by national economic conditions as well as perceptions of those conditions and future economic prospects changes in such economic conditions are not predictable and cannot be controlled adverse economic conditions that could affect us include 

 these scenarios could require us to charge off a higher percentage of loans and increase provision for credit losses which would reduce our net income and otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations for example our business was significantly affected by the global economic and financial crisis that began in 2008 the falling home prices increased rate of foreclosure and high levels of unemployment in the united states triggered significant writedowns by us and other financial institutions these writedowns adversely impacted our financial results in material respects although the us economy continues to recover an interruption or reversal of this recovery would adversely affect the financial services industry and banking sector in particular although the ongoing general economic recovery has positively impacted the real estate market the fundamentals within the real estate sector including asset values high vacancy rates and rent values remain relatively weak compared to prior to the global economic and financial crisis should the recovery of real estate asset values reduction in vacancies and improvement in rents be interrupted for an extended period of time it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we operate in an industry that is highly competitive which could result in losing business or margin declines and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we operate in a highly competitive industry the industry could become even more competitive as a result of reform of the financial services industry resulting from the doddfrank act and other legislative regulatory and technological changes as well as continued consolidation we face aggressive competition from other domestic and foreign lending institutions and from numerous other providers of financial services including the following 

 

 

 as a result of these and other sources of competition we could lose business to competitors or be forced to price products and services on less advantageous terms to retain or attract clients either of which would adversely affect our profitability and business

volatility in the global financial markets resulting from relapse of the eurozone crisis geopolitical developments in eastern europe or otherwise could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

volatility in the global financial markets could have an adverse effect on the economic recovery in the united states and could result from a number of causes including a relapse in the eurozone crisis geopolitical developments in eastern europe or otherwise the effects of the eurozone crisis which began in late 2009 as part of the global economic and financial crisis continued to impact the global financial markets through 2014  numerous factors continued to fuel the eurozone crisis including continued high levels of government debt the undercapitalization and liquidity problems of many banks in the eurozone and relatively low levels of economic growth these factors made it difficult or impossible for some countries in the eurozone to repay or refinance their debt without the assistance of third parties as a combination of austerity programs debt writedowns and the european central bank’s commitment to restore financial stability to the eurozone and the finalization of the primary european stability mechanism bailout fund in 2013  and into 2014  interest rates began to fall and stock prices began to increase although these trends helped to stabilize the effects of the eurozone crisis in the first half of 2014  the underlying causes of the crisis were not completely eliminated as a result the financial markets relapsed toward the end of 2014  in addition russian intervention in ukraine during 2014  significantly increased regional geopolitical tensions in response to russian actions us and european governments have imposed sanctions on a limited number of russian individuals and business entities the situation remains fluid with potential for further escalation of geopolitical tensions increased severity of sanctions against russian interests and possible russian countermeasures further economic sanctions could destabilize the economic environment and result in increased volatility should the economic recovery in the united states be adversely impacted by a return in volatility in the global financial markets caused by a continued relapse in the eurozone crisis or developments in respect of the russian sanctions or for any other reason loan and asset growth and liquidity conditions at us financial institutions including us may deteriorate moreover until rbs divests its interest in us adverse trends in the eurozone and eastern europe could increase investor concern or even if not accurate stimulate perceptions of funding difficulties for our business because rbs is based in the united kingdom and has significant exposure to european economies if any of these factors were to materialize it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

further downgrades to the us government’s credit rating or the credit rating of its securities by one or more of the credit ratings agencies could have a material adverse effect on general economic conditions as well as our operations earnings and financial condition 

on august 5 2011 standard  poor’s cut the us government’s sovereign credit rating of longterm us federal debt from aaa to aa while also keeping its outlook negative moody’s also lowered its outlook to “negative” on august 2 2011 and fitch lowered its outlook to “negative” on november 28 2011 during 2013  both moody’s and standard  poor’s revised their outlook from “negative” to “stable” and on march 21 2014 fitch revised its outlook from “negative” to “stable” further downgrades of the us government’s sovereign credit rating and the perceived creditworthiness of us governmentrelated obligations could impact our ability to obtain funding that is collateralized by affected instruments such downgrades could also affect the pricing of funding when it is available a downgrade may also adversely affect the market value of such instruments a downgrade of the sovereign credit ratings of the us government or the credit ratings of related institutions agencies or instrumentalities would significantly exacerbate the other risks to which we are subject and any related adverse effects on its business financial condition and results of operations 

the conditions of other financial institutions or of the financial services industry could adversely affect our operations and financial conditions 

financial services institutions that deal with each other are interconnected as a result of trading investment liquidity management clearing counterparty and other relationships within the financial services industry the default by any one institution could lead to defaults by other institutions concerns about or a default by one institution could lead to significant liquidity problems and losses or defaults by other institutions as the commercial and financial soundness of many financial institutions are closely related as a result of these credit trading clearing and other relationships even the perceived lack of creditworthiness of or questions about a counterparty may lead to marketwide liquidity problems and losses or defaults by various institutions this systemic risk may adversely affect financial intermediaries such as clearing agencies banks and exchanges with which we interact on a daily basis or key funding providers such as the federal home loan banks “fhlbs” any of which could have a material adverse effect on our access to liquidity or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

risks related to regulations governing our industry 

as a financial holding company and a bank holding company we are subject to comprehensive regulation that could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

as a financial holding company and a bank holding company we are subject to comprehensive regulation supervision and examination by the federal reserve board in addition cbna is subject to comprehensive regulation supervision and examination by the occ and cbpa is subject to comprehensive regulation supervision and examination by the fdic and the pa banking department our regulators supervise us through regular examinations and other means that allow the regulators to gauge management’s ability to identify assess and control risk in all areas of operations in a safe and sound manner and to ensure compliance with laws and regulations in the course of their supervision and examinations our regulators may require improvements in various areas if we are unable to implement and maintain any required actions in a timely and effective manner we could become subject to informal nonpublic or formal public supervisory actions and public enforcement orders that could lead to significant restrictions on our existing business or on our ability to engage in any new business such forms of supervisory action could include without limitation written agreements cease and desist orders and consent orders and may among other things result in restrictions on our ability to pay dividends requirements to increase capital restrictions on our activities the imposition of civil monetary penalties and enforcement of such actions through injunctions or restraining orders we could also be required to dispose of certain assets and liabilities within a prescribed period the terms of any such supervisory or enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are a bank holding company that has elected to become a financial holding company pursuant to the bank holding company act financial holding companies are allowed to engage in certain financial activities in which a bank holding company is not otherwise permitted to engage however to maintain financial holding company status a bank holding company and all of its subsidiaries must be “well capitalized” and “well managed” if a bank holding company ceases to meet these capital and management requirements there are many penalties it would be faced with including i the federal reserve board may impose limitations or conditions on the conduct of its activities and ii it may not undertake any of the broader financial activities permissible for financial holding companies or acquire a company engaged in such financial activities without prior approval of the federal reserve board if a company does not return to compliance within 180 days which period may be extended the federal reserve board may require divestiture of that company’s depository institutions to the extent we do not meet the requirements to be a financial holding company there could be a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we may be unable to disclose some restrictions or limitations on our operations imposed by our regulators 

from time to time bank regulatory agencies take supervisory actions that restrict or limit a financial institution’s activities and lead it to raise capital or subject it to other requirements directives issued to enforce such actions may be confidential and thus in some instances we are not permitted to publicly disclose these actions in addition as part of our regular examination process our and our banking subsidiaries’ respective regulators may advise us or our banking subsidiaries to operate under various restrictions as a prudential matter any such actions or restrictions if and in whatever manner imposed could adversely affect our costs and revenues moreover efforts to comply with any such nonpublic supervisory actions or restrictions may require material investments in additional resources and systems as well as a significant commitment of managerial time and attention as a result such supervisory actions or restrictions if and in whatever manner imposed could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations and in certain instances we may not be able to publicly disclose these matters 

the regulatory environment in which we operate could have a material adverse effect on our business and earnings 

we are heavily regulated by bank and other regulatory agencies at the federal and state levels this regulatory oversight is established to protect depositors the fdic’s deposit insurance fund and the banking system as a whole not security holders changes to statutes regulations rules or policies including the interpretation or implementation of statutes regulations rules or policies could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways including limiting the types of financial services and other products we may offer limiting our ability to pursue acquisitions and increasing the ability of third parties to offer competing financial services and products 

we are subject to capital adequacy and liquidity standards and if we fail to meet these standards our financial condition and operations would be adversely affected 

we are subject to several capital adequacy and liquidity standards to the extent that we are unable to meet these standards our ability to make distributions of capital will be limited and we may be subject to additional supervisory actions and limitations on our activities the capital adequacy and liquidity standards that we must meet include the following

we could be required to act as a “source of strength” to our banking subsidiaries which would have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

federal reserve board policy historically required bank holding companies to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to their subsidiary banks the doddfrank act codified this policy as a statutory requirement this support may be required by the federal reserve board at times when we might otherwise determine not to provide it or when doing so is not otherwise in the interests of cfg or our stockholders or creditors and may include one or more of the following 

 

 

 we depend on our banking subsidiaries for most of our revenue and restrictions on dividends and other distributions by our banking subsidiaries could affect our liquidity and ability to fulfill our obligations 

as a bank holding company we are a separate and distinct legal entity from our banking subsidiaries cbna and cbpa we typically receive substantially all of our revenue from dividends from our banking subsidiaries these dividends are the principal source of funds to pay dividends on our equity and interest and principal on our debt various federal andor state laws and regulations as well as regulatory expectations limit the amount of dividends that our banking subsidiaries may pay for example 

 

 

 

 as a result of the goodwill impairment recognized by cbna in the second quarter of 2013  cbna does not meet the recent earnings test and must obtain specific prior approval from the occ before making a capital distribution we expect the recent earnings test to remain negative through 2015  as a result we expect that cbna will be required to obtain specific prior approval from the occ before making a capital distribution through 2015  since the goodwill impairment in 2013  the occ has approved each request by cbna to distribute to us up to 30 of its prior quarter aftertax net income however cbna may not rely on past or current approvals as a guarantee of future approvals under the pennsylvania banking code of 1965 as amended the “pa code” cbpa is restricted from paying dividends in excess of accumulated net earnings as of december 31 2014  cbpa’s accumulated net earnings were 87 million more generally the banking agencies have significant discretion to limit or even preclude dividends even if the statutory quantitative thresholds are satisfied 

we are and may be subject to regulatory actions that may have a material impact on our business 

we are involved from time to time in reviews investigations and proceedings both formal and informal by governmental and selfregulatory agencies regarding our business these regulatory actions involve among other matters accounting and operational matters certain of which may result in adverse judgments settlements fines penalties injunctions or other relief that 

 48

may require changes to our business or otherwise materially impact our business for example in april 2013 our banking subsidiaries consented to the issuance of orders by the occ and the fdic the “consent orders” in the consent orders which are publicly available and will remain in effect until terminated by the regulators our banking subsidiaries neither admitted nor denied the regulators’ findings that they had engaged in deceptive marketing and implementation of the bank’s overdraft protection program checking rewards programs and stoppayment process for preauthorized recurring electronic fund transfers under the consent orders our banking subsidiaries paid a total of 10 million in civil monetary penalties and 8 million in restitution to affected customers agreed to cease and desist any operations in violation of section 5 of the federal trade commission act and submit to the regulators periodic written progress reports regarding compliance with the consent orders for more information regarding ongoing significant regulatory actions in which we are involved and certain identified past practices and policies for which we could face potential formal administrative enforcement actions see note 16 “commitments and contingencies” to our audited consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 — financial statements and supplementary data included elsewhere in the report for further discussion 

in regulatory actions such as those referred to above it is inherently difficult to determine whether any loss is probable or possible to reasonably estimate the amount of any loss we cannot predict with certainty if how or when such proceedings will be resolved or what the eventual fine penalty or other relief conditions or restrictions if any may be particularly for actions that are in their early stages of investigation we expect to make significant restitution payments to our banking subsidiaries’ customers arising from certain of the consumer compliance issues and also expect to pay civil money penalties in connection with certain of these issues adverse regulatory actions could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are and may be subject to litigation that may have a material impact on our business 

our operations are diverse and complex and we operate in legal and regulatory environments that expose us to potentially significant litigation risk in the normal course of business we have been named from time to time as a defendant in various legal actions including arbitrations class actions and other litigation arising in connection with our activities as a financial services institution including with respect to unfair or deceptive business practices and misselling of certain products certain of the actual or threatened legal actions include claims for substantial compensatory andor punitive damages or claims for indeterminate amounts of damages in some cases the entities that would otherwise be the primary defendants in such cases are bankrupt or in financial distress we recently settled legal actions alleging violations under the fair labor standards act and certain state fair wage laws moreover a number of recent judicial decisions have upheld the right of borrowers to sue lending institutions on the basis of various evolving legal theories collectively termed “lender liability” generally lender liability is founded on the premise that a lender has either violated a duty whether implied or contractual of good faith and fair dealing owed to the borrower or has assumed a degree of control over the borrower resulting in the creation of a fiduciary duty owed to the borrower or its other creditors or stockholders this could increase the amount of private litigation to which we are subject for more information regarding ongoing significant legal proceedings in which we are involved and certain identified past practices and policies for which we could face potential civil litigation see note 16 “commitments and contingencies” to our audited consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 — financial statements and supplementary data included elsewhere in the report for further discussion 

in disputes and legal proceedings such as those referred to above it is inherently difficult to determine whether any loss is probable or possible to reasonably estimate the amount of any loss we cannot predict with certainty if how or when such proceedings will be resolved or what the eventual settlement fine penalty or other relief if any may be particularly for proceedings that are in their early stages of development or where plaintiffs seek substantial or indeterminate damages numerous issues may need to be resolved including through potentially lengthy discovery and determination of important factual matters determination of issues related to class certification and the calculation of damages and by addressing novel or unsettled legal questions relevant to the proceedings in question before a loss or additional loss or range of loss or additional loss can be reasonably estimated for any proceeding adverse judgments in litigation or adverse regulatory actions could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

the doddfrank act has changed and will likely continue to substantially change the legal and regulatory framework under which we operate our business 

on july 21 2010 president obama signed into law the doddfrank act which has changed and will likely continue to substantially change the legal and regulatory framework under which we operate the doddfrank act represents a significant overhaul of many aspects of the regulation of the financialservices industry addressing among other things i systemic risk ii capital adequacy iii consumer financial protection iv interchange fees v mortgage lending practices and vi regulation of derivatives and securities markets a significant number of the provisions of the doddfrank act still require extensive rulemaking

risk factors 

and interpretation by regulatory authorities in several cases authorities have extended implementation periods and delayed effective dates accordingly in many respects the ultimate impact of the doddfrank act and its effects on the us financial system and on us will not be known for an extended period of time 

the following are some of the current provisions of the doddfrank act that may affect our operations 

 some of these and other major changes under the doddfrank act could materially impact the profitability of our business the value of assets we hold or the collateral available for coverage under our loans require changes to our business practices or force us to discontinue businesses and expose us to additional costs taxes liabilities enforcement actions and reputational risk 

the doddfrank act’s provisions and related rules that restrict bank interchange fees may negatively impact our revenues and earnings 

pursuant to the doddfrank act the federal reserve board adopted rules effective october 1 2011 limiting the interchange fees that may be charged with respect to electronic debit transactions interchange fees or “swipe” fees are charges that merchants pay to us and other credit card companies and cardissuing banks for processing electronic payment transactions since taking effect these limitations have reduced our debit card interchange revenues and have created meaningful compliance costs additional limits may further reduce our debit card interchange revenues and create additional compliance costs 

the cfpb’s residential mortgage regulations could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

the cfpb finalized a number of significant rules that will impact nearly every aspect of the lifecycle of a residential mortgage these rules implement the doddfrank act amendments to the equal credit opportunity act the truth in lending act and the real estate settlement procedures act the final rules require banks to among other things i develop and implement procedures to ensure compliance with a new “reasonable ability to repay” test and identify whether a loan meets a new definition for a “qualified mortgage” ii implement new or revised disclosures policies and procedures for servicing mortgages including but not limited to early intervention with delinquent borrowers and specific loss mitigation procedures for loans secured by a borrower’s principal residence iii comply with additional restrictions on mortgage loan originator compensation and iv comply with new disclosure requirements and standards for appraisals and escrow accounts maintained for “higher priced mortgage loans” these new rules create operational and strategic challenges for us as we are both a mortgage originator and a servicer for example business models for cost pricing delivery compensation and risk management will need to be reevaluated and potentially revised perhaps substantially additionally programming changes and enhancements to systems will be necessary to comply with the new rules we also expect additional rulemaking affecting our residential mortgage business to be forthcoming these rules and any other new regulatory requirements promulgated by the cfpb and state regulatory authorities could require changes to our business in addition to the changes we have been required to make thus far such changes would result in increased compliance costs and potential changes to our product offerings which would have an adverse effect on the revenue derived from such business 

the doddfrank act’s consumer protection regulations could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

the federal reserve board enacted consumer protection regulations related to automated overdraft payment programs offered by financial institutions prior to the enactment of these regulations our overdraft and insufficient funds fees represented a significant amount of noninterest fees since taking effect on july 1 2010 the fees received by us for automated overdraft payment services have decreased thereby adversely impacting our noninterest income complying with these regulations has resulted in increased operational costs for us which may continue to rise the actual impact of these regulations in future periods could vary due to a variety of factors including changes in customer behavior economic conditions and other factors which could

adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations the cfpb has since then published additional studies of overdraft practices and has announced that it is considering enacting further regulations regarding overdrafts and related services 

the consumer protection provisions of the doddfrank act and the examination supervision and enforcement of those laws and implementing regulations by the cfpb have created a more intense and complex environment for consumer finance regulation the cfpb is authorized to engage in consumer financial education track consumer complaints request data and promote the availability of financial services to underserved consumers and communities we expect increased oversight of financial services products by the cfpb which is likely to affect our operations the cfpb has significant authority to implement and enforce federal consumer finance laws including the truth in lending act the equal credit opportunity act the fair credit billing act and new requirements for financial services products provided for in the doddfrank act as well as the authority to identify and prohibit unfair deceptive or abusive acts and practices “udaap” the review of products and practices to prevent udaap is a continuing focus of the cfpb and of banking regulators more broadly the ultimate impact of this heightened scrutiny is uncertain but could result in changes to pricing practices products and procedures it could also result in increased costs related to regulatory oversight supervision and examination additional remediation efforts and possible penalties 

in addition the doddfrank act provides the cfpb with broad supervisory examination and enforcement authority over various consumer financial products and services including the ability to require reimbursements and other payments to customers for alleged legal violations and to impose significant penalties as well as injunctive relief that prohibits lenders from engaging in allegedly unlawful practices the cfpb also has the authority to obtain cease and desist orders providing for affirmative relief andor monetary penalties the doddfrank act and accompanying regulations including regulations to be promulgated by the cfpb are being phased in over time and while some regulations have been promulgated many others have not yet been proposed or finalized for example the cfpb has announced that it is considering new rules regarding debt collection practices and has proposed new regulations of prepaid accounts and proposed amendments to its regulations implementing the home mortgage disclosure act we cannot predict the terms of all of the final regulations their intended consequences or how such regulations will affect us or our industry 

the doddfrank act does not prevent states from adopting stricter consumer protection standards state regulation of financial products and potential enforcement actions could also adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

compliance with antimoney laundering and antiterrorism financing rules involve significant cost and effort 

we are subject to rules and regulations regarding money laundering and the financing of terrorism monitoring compliance with antimoney laundering and antiterrorism financing rules can put a significant financial burden on banks and other financial institutions and poses significant technical challenges although we believe our current policies and procedures are sufficient to comply with applicable rules and regulations we cannot guarantee that our antimoney laundering and antiterrorism financing policies and procedures completely prevent situations of money laundering or terrorism financing any such failure events may have severe consequences including sanctions fines and reputational consequences which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

we may become subject to more stringent regulatory requirements and activity restrictions or have to restructure if the federal reserve board and fdic determine that our resolution plan is not credible 

federal reserve board and fdic regulations require bank holding companies with more than 50 billion in assets to submit resolution plans that in the event of material financial distress or failure establish the rapid orderly and systemically safe liquidation of the company under the us bankruptcy code insured depository institutions with more than 50 billion in assets must submit to the fdic a resolution plan whereby they can be resolved in a manner that is orderly and that ensures that depositors will receive access to insured funds within certain required timeframes if the federal reserve board and the fdic jointly determine that the resolution plan of a company is not credible and the company fails to cure the deficiencies in a timely manner then the federal reserve board and the fdic may jointly impose on the company or on any of its subsidiaries more stringent capital leverage or liquidity requirements or restrictions on growth activities or operations or require the divestment of certain assets or operations if the federal reserve board and the fdic determine that our resolution plan is not credible or would not facilitate our orderly resolution under the us bankruptcy code we could become subject to more stringent regulatory requirements or business restrictions or have to divest certain of our assets or businesses any such measures could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations

risks related to our common stock 

our stock price could decline due to the large number of outstanding shares of our common stock eligible for future sale and rbs has committed to sell its remaining beneficial ownership of our common stock by the end of 2016 with a possible 12 month extension in certain circumstances the exact timing of such sale or sales remains uncertain 

the sale of substantial amounts of shares of our common stock in the public market or the perception that such sales could occur could harm the prevailing market price of common stock these sales or the possibility that these sales may occur also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate upon completion of our initial public offering we had a total of 559998324 outstanding shares of common stock of the outstanding shares the 161000000 shares sold in our initial public offering are freely tradable without restriction or further registration under the securities act except that any shares held by our affiliates as that term is defined under rule 144 of the securities act may be sold only in compliance with applicable limitations 

the remaining 398998324 shares that were outstanding following completion of the initial public offering were held by rbsg international holdings limited a wholly owned subsidiary of rbs these shares are subject to certain restrictions on resale we our officers directors and the selling stockholders that own shares of our common stock following the completion of the initial public offering signed lockup agreements with the underwriters that subject to certain customary exceptions restrict the sale of the shares of our common stock held by them for 180 days following the date of our initial public offering subject to extension in the case of an earnings release or material news or a material event relating to us morgan stanley  co llc goldman sachs  co and jp morgan securities llc may in their sole discretion terminate these lockup agreements or release all or any portion of the shares of common stock subject to lockup agreements 

upon the expiration waiver or release of the lockup agreements described above all such shares will be eligible for resale in a public market subject in the case of shares held by our affiliates to volume manner of sale and other limitations under rule 144 we expect that the members of rbs group will be considered affiliates after the expiration of the lockup agreements based on their expected share ownership as well as their veto and board nomination rights under the separation agreement we entered into with rbs prior to the completion of our initial public offering however commencing after the expiration of the lockup agreements rbs has the right subject to certain exceptions and conditions to require us to register its shares of common stock under the securities act and it will have the right to participate in future registrations of securities by us registration of any of these outstanding shares of common stock would result in such shares becoming freely tradable without compliance with rule 144 upon effectiveness of the registration statement 

as restrictions on resale end the market price of our shares of common stock could drop significantly as rbs has publicly stated its intent to sell its remaining shares in the short to medium term rbs group which is currently controlled by the uk government is undertaking a restructuring plan to facilitate its eventual privatization as part of its obligations under the european commission’s state aid amendment decision of april 9 2014 rbs has committed to dispose of its remaining ownership of our common stock by december 31 2016 with an automatic 12month extension depending on market conditions rbs’s current intention for disposal of its remaining ownership of our common stock is to sell over time such remaining shares in a series of tranches subject to market conditions and the terms of the lockup provisions discussed above the timing and manner of the sale of rbs’s remaining ownership of our common stock remains uncertain and we have no control over the manner in which rbs may seek to divest such remaining shares rbs could elect to sell its common stock in a number of different ways including in a number of tranches via future registrations or alternatively by the sale of all or a significant tranche of such remaining shares to a single thirdparty purchaser any such sale would impact the price of our shares of common stock and there can be no guarantee that the price at which rbs is willing to sell its remaining shares will be at a level that our board would be prepared to recommend to holders of our common stock or that you determine adequately values our shares of common stock 

in addition these factors could also make it more difficult for us to raise additional funds through future offerings of our shares of common stock or other securities 

if rbs sells a controlling interest in our company to a third party in a private transaction you may not realize any changeofcontrol premium on shares of our common stock and we may become subject to the control of a presently unknown third party 

rbs beneficially owns a significant equity interest of our company rbs will have the ability should it choose to do so to sell some or all of its shares of our common stock in a privately negotiated transaction which if sufficient in size could result in a change of control of our company 

 52 

citizens financial group inc 

risk factors 

the ability of rbs to privately sell its shares of our common stock with no requirement for a concurrent offer to be made to acquire all of the shares of our outstanding common stock that will be publicly traded hereafter could prevent you from realizing any changeofcontrol premium on your shares of our common stock that may otherwise accrue to rbs on its private sale of our common stock additionally if rbs privately sells its significant equity interest in our company we may become subject to the control of a presently unknown third party such third party may have conflicts of interest with those of other stockholders in addition if rbs sells a controlling interest in our company to a third party rbs may terminate the license agreement and other transitional arrangements and our other commercial agreements and relationships could be impacted all of which may adversely affect our ability to run our business and may have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

our stock price may be volatile and you could lose all or part of your investment as a result 

you should consider an investment in our common stock to be risky and you should invest in our common stock only if you can withstand a significant loss and wide fluctuation in the market value of your investment the market price of our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to among other things the factors described in this “risk factors” section and other factors some of which are beyond our control these factors include 

 furthermore the stock markets have experienced price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market price of equity securities of many companies these fluctuations have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies 

these broad market fluctuations as well as general economic systemic political and market conditions such as recessions loss of investor confidence interest rate changes or international currency fluctuations may negatively affect the market price of our common stock 

if any of the foregoing occurs it could cause our stock price to fall and may expose us to securities class action litigation that even if unsuccessful could be costly to defend and a distraction to management 

we may not pay cash dividends on our common stock 

although we intend to pay dividends to our stockholders we have no obligation to do so and may change our dividend policy at any time without notice to our stockholders holders of our common stock are only entitled to receive such cash dividends as our board may declare out of funds legally available for such payments any decision to declare and pay dividends will be dependent on a variety of factors including our financial condition earnings legal requirements and other factors that our board deems relevant as well as obtaining applicable regulatory consents and approvals as described under “regulation and supervision” in part i item 1 — business included elsewhere in this report including the ccar process in addition our ability to pay dividends may be limited by covenants of any future indebtedness we or our subsidiaries incur as a result you may not receive any return on an investment in our common stock unless you sell our common stock for a price greater than that which you paid for it in addition since we are a holding company with no significant assets other than the capital stock of our banking subsidiaries we depend upon dividends from our banking subsidiaries for substantially all of our income accordingly our ability to pay dividends depends primarily upon the receipt of dividends or other capital distributions from our banking subsidiaries the ability of our banking subsidiaries to pay dividends to us is subject to among other things their earnings financial condition and need for funds as well as federal and state governmental policies and regulations applicable to us and our banking subsidiaries which limit the

amount that may be paid as dividends without prior regulatory approval see “—we depend on our banking subsidiaries for most of our revenue and restrictions on dividends and other distributions by our banking subsidiaries could affect our liquidity and ability to fulfill our obligations” and “regulation and supervision” in part i item 1 — business included elsewhere in this report 

“antitakeover” provisions and the regulations to which we are subject may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us even if the change in control would be beneficial to stockholders 

we are a bank holding company incorporated in the state of delaware antitakeover provisions in delaware law and our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws as well as regulatory approvals that would be required under federal law could make it more difficult for a third party to take control of us and may prevent stockholders from receiving a premium for their shares of our common stock these provisions could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and could reduce the amount that stockholders might get if we are sold 

these provisions include the following some of which may only become effective when rbs no longer owns shares of our common stock representing at least 50 of our issued and outstanding capital stock 

 we believe these provisions protect our stockholders from coercive or otherwise unfair takeover tactics by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with our board and by providing our board with more time to assess any acquisition proposal however these provisions apply even if the offer may be determined to be beneficial by some stockholders and could delay or prevent an acquisition that our board determines is not in our best interest and that of our stockholders 

furthermore banking laws impose notice approval and ongoing regulatory requirements on any stockholder or other party that seeks to acquire direct or indirect “control” of an fdicinsured depository institution these laws include the bank holding company act and the change in bank control act these laws could delay or prevent an acquisition

recent events 

on december 4 2014 our subsidiary cbna issued 15 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes collectively the “senior notes” the senior notes consisted of 750 million of 1600 senior unsecured notes due december 2017 at an issue price of 99947 and 750 million of 2450 senior unsecured notes due december 2019 at an issue price of 99906 the senior notes were offered under the banks global bank note program dated december 1 2014 the bank used the proceeds for general corporate purposes the securities have not been registered under the securities act of 1933 

on september 29 2014 we completed the initial public offering through the sale by rbs group of 161000000 shares or 288 of our common stock which included the full exercise of the underwriters’ option to purchase an additional 21000000 shares our common stock began trading on the new york stock exchange on september 24 2014 under the ticker symbol “cfg” subsequently on october 8 2014 we executed a capital exchange transaction with rbs group which involved the issuance of 334 million of 10year subordinated notes at a rate of 4082 and the simultaneous repurchase of 14297761 shares of common stock owned by rbs group at an average price per share of 2336 we plan to continue our strategy of capital optimization by repurchasing an additional 500 million to 750 million of our shares of common stock with the proceeds from the issuance of preferred stock subordinated debt or senior debt in 2015  and 2016  subject to regulatory approval and market conditions upon completion of the capital transaction with rbs group on october 8 2014 rbs group owned 705 of the outstanding common stock of cfg for additional information see “—capital” 

on june 20 2014 we completed the sale of certain assets and liabilities associated with our chicagoarea retail branches small business relationships and select middle market relationships to us bancorp the agreement to sell these assets and liabilities to us bancorp had previously been announced in january 2014 this sale included 103 branches including 94 fullservice branches with 48 billion of deposits and 10 billion in loans as of june 20 2014 we recorded a pretax gain on the sale of 288 million and also incurred related expenses of 17 million management estimates that the chicago divestiture has the effect of reducing quarterly net interest income by approximately 13 million noninterest income by approximately 12 million and

managements discussion and analysis 

noninterest expense by approximately 21 million we intend to invest the majority of the sale proceeds over time into higher returning activities

key factors affecting our business 

macroeconomic conditions 

our business is affected by national regional and local economic conditions as well as the perception of those conditions and future economic prospects the significant macroeconomic factors that impact our business are the us and global economic landscapes unemployment rates the housing markets and interest rates 

the us economy as measured by the real gross domestic product “gdp” expanded 24  in the year ended december 31 2014  driven by gains in personal consumption nonresidential investment and inventory investment with growth in the fourth quarter of 26 this expansion followed considerable improvement in the economic landscape in the united states in 2013  with gdp growth of 22  we currently expect that us gdp growth in 2015  may be challenged by a stronger dollar and weak international growth the euro area economy “eu18” expanded 03  in the year ended december 31 2014 after having emerged from recession in the second half of 2013 concerns of deflation and less favorable financial condition added to fears of a weaker recovery in europe in response on january 22 2015 the european central bank announced a new quantitative easing plan that includes the purchasing of €60 billion of assets per month at least through september 2016 contributing to the low domestic rate environment 

the us unemployment rate dropped to 56  at december 31 2014  from 67  at december 31 2013  the overall improvement was partially driven by a decrease in the labor force participation rate which declined to its lowest level in over 35 years us job growth has been a key support to gdp growth with the economy adding three million jobs in 2014 after a pause in the first quarter of 2014 and a recovery through the second quarter the housing market moved sideways in the fourth quarter of 2014  as demonstrated by a trendline in new and existing home sales as well as flat to modestly declining prices 

the federal reserve board maintained very accommodative monetary policy conditions during 2014 continuing to effectively target a zero federal funds rate at the short end of the yield curve and through its quantitative easing programs purchasing treasury and agency mortgagebacked securities in the intermediate and long end of the yield curve the federal reserve ended its quantitative easing purchases on october 29 2014 interest rates remain relatively low see “—interest rates” below for further discussion of the impact of interest rates on our results 

credit trends 

credit trends continued to improve in 2014 as evidenced by a continued reduction in both net chargeoffs and nonperforming loans net chargeoffs of 323 million  decreased 178 million  or 36  from 501 million  in 2013 annualized net chargeoffs as a percentage of total average loans improved to 036  in 2014 compared to 059  in 2013 we currently expect overall chargeoff rates to increase marginally in 2015  and 2016  as commercial recovery opportunities dissipate home prices stabilize and noncore portfolios continue to decrease 

interest rates 

net interest income is our largest source of revenue and is the difference between the interest earned on interestearning assets usually loans and investment securities and the interest expense incurred in connection with interestbearing liabilities usually deposits and borrowings the level of net interest income is primarily a function of the average balance of interestearning assets the average balance of interestbearing liabilities and the spread between the contractual yield on such assets and the contractual cost of such liabilities these factors are influenced by both the pricing and mix of interestearning assets and interestbearing liabilities which in turn are impacted by external factors such as local economic conditions competition for loans and deposits the monetary policy of the federal reserve board and market interest rates for further discussion refer to “—risk governance” and “—market risk — nontrading risk” 

 63 

citizens financial group inc 

managements discussion and analysis 

the cost of our deposits and shortterm wholesale borrowings is largely based on shortterm interest rates which are primarily driven by the federal reserve board’s actions however the yields generated by our loans and securities are typically driven by shortterm and longterm interest rates which are set by the market or at times by the federal reserve board’s actions the level of net interest income is therefore influenced by movements in such interest rates and the pace at which such movements occur in 2013  and 2014  shortterm and longterm interest rates remained at very low levels by historical standards with many benchmark rates such as the federal funds rate and one and threemonth libor near zero further declines in the yield curve or a decline in longerterm yields relative to shortterm yields a flatter yield curve would have an adverse impact on our net interest margin and net interest income 

in 2013  and 2014  the federal reserve board maintained a highly accommodative monetary policy and indicated that this policy would remain in effect for a considerable time after its asset purchase program ended on october 29 2014 and the economic recovery strengthens in the united states as of december 31 2014  the federal reserve had ended its asset purchases of treasury securities and agency mortgagebacked securities however until further notice the federal reserve will continue to reinvest runoff from its 17 trillion mortgagebacked portfolio 

regulatory trends 

we are subject to extensive regulation and supervision which continue to evolve as the legal and regulatory framework governing our operations continues to change the current operating environment also has heightened regulatory expectations around many regulations including consumer compliance the bank secrecy act and antimoney laundering compliance and increased internal audit activities as a result of these heightened expectations we expect to incur additional costs for additional compliance personnel or professional fees associated with advisors and consultants 

doddfrank regulation 

as described under “regulation and supervision” in part i item 1 — business included elsewhere in this report we are subject to a variety of laws and regulations including the doddfrank act the doddfrank act is complex and many aspects of the act are subject to final rulemaking that will take effect over several years the doddfrank act will continue to impact our earnings through fee reductions higher costs and imposition of new restrictions on us the doddfrank act may also continue to have a material adverse impact on the value of certain assets and liabilities held on our balance sheet the ultimate impact of the doddfrank act on our business will depend on regulatory interpretation and rulemaking as well as the success of any of our actions to mitigate the negative impacts of certain provisions key parts of the doddfrank act that specifically impact our business are the repeal of a previous prohibition against payment of interest on demand deposits which became effective in july 2011 the introduction of a stresstesting and capital planning framework developed by the federal reserve board known as ccar and the doddfrank act stress test “dfast” framework the dfast process projects net income loan losses and capital ratios over a ninequarter horizon under hypothetical stressful macroeconomic and financial market scenarios developed by the federal reserve board as well as certain mandated assumptions about capital distributions prescribed in the dfast rule during the third quarter of 2014 as part of our obligations under dfast we published the results of our midcycle severely adverse scenario consistent with the purpose of the dfast process and the assumptions used in order to assess our likely performance during hypothetical economic conditions the projected results under the dfast severely adverse scenarios show severe negative impacts on earnings however these pro forma results should not be interpreted to be management expectations in light of the current economic and operating environment 

repeal of the prohibition on depository institutions paying interest on demand deposits 

we began offering interestbearing corporate checking accounts after the 2011 repeal of the prohibition on depository institutions paying interest on demand deposits currently industrywide interest rates for this product are very low and thus far the impact of the repeal has not had a significant effect on our results however market rates could increase more significantly in the future if we need to pay higher interest rates on checking accounts to maintain current clients or attract new clients our interest expense would increase perhaps materially furthermore if we fail to offer interest rates at a sufficient level to retain demand deposits our core deposits may be reduced which would require us to obtain funding in other ways or limit potential future asset growth 

comprehensive capital analysis and review 

ccar is an annual exercise by the federal reserve board to ensure that the largest bank holding companies have sufficient capital to continue operations throughout times of economic and financial stress and robust forwardlooking capital planning processes that account for their unique risks 

 64 

citizens financial group inc 

managements discussion and analysis 

as part of ccar the federal reserve board evaluates institutions’ capital adequacy internal capital adequacy assessment processes and their plans to make capital distributions such as dividend payments or stock repurchases in march 2014 the federal reserve board objected on qualitative grounds to our capital plan submitted as part of the ccar process in addition to modifications we may be required to make in connection with our proposed capital distributions through the ccar process we may incur additional expenses in connection with the ccar process that would affect our profitability and results of operations the federal reserve board is currently conducting a review of the capital plans submitted by us and other large bank holding companies in january 2015 the levels at which we will be able to declare dividends and repurchase shares of our common stock after march 2015 will depend on the federal reserve board’s qualitative and quantitative assessment of our capital plan and our projected performance under the stress scenarios the federal reserve announced on february 12 2015 that results from the latest supervisory stress tests conducted as part of the doddfrank act for large bank holding companies supervised by the federal reserve will be released on march 5 2015 and the related results from the ccar will be released on march 11 2015 

basel iii final rules applicable to us and our banking subsidiaries 

in july 2013 the federal reserve board occ and fdic issued the us basel iii final rules the final rules implements the basel iii capital framework and certain provisions of the doddfrank act including the collins amendment certain aspects of the final rules such as the new minimum capital ratios became effective on january 1 2015 in order to comply with the new capital requirements we established capital ratio targets that meet or exceed us regulatory expectations under fully phasedin basel iii rules and as a result our capital requirements were increased 

heloc payment shock 

recent attention has been given by regulators rating agencies and the general press regarding the potential for increased exposure to credit losses associated with helocs that were originated during the period of rapid home price appreciation between 2003 and 2007 industrywide many of the helocs originated during this timeframe were structured with an extended interestonly payment period followed by a requirement to convert to a higher payment amount that would begin fully amortizing both principal and interest beginning at a certain date in the future as of december 31 2014  approximately 29  of our 160 billion  heloc portfolio or 46 billion  in drawn balances and 38 billion  in undrawn balances were subject to a payment reset or balloon payment between january 1 2015 and december 31 2017 including 245 million  in balloon balances where full payment is due at the end of a tenyear interest only draw period 

to help manage this exposure in september 2013 we launched a comprehensive program designed to provide heightened customer outreach to inform educate and assist customers through the reset process as well as to offer alternative financing and forbearance options preliminary results indicate that our efforts to assist customers at risk of default have successfully reduced delinquency and chargeoff rates compared to our original expectations 

as of december 31 2014  for the 898 million of our heloc portfolio that was originally structured with a reset period in 2014  937  of the balances were refinanced paid off or were current on payments 49  were past due and 14  had been charged off as of december 31 2014  for the 668 million of our heloc portfolio that was originally structured with a reset period in 2013 932  of the balances had been refinanced paid off or were current on payments 34  were past due and 34  had been charged off a total of 14 billion  in balances are structured with a reset period in 2015 factors that affect our future expectations for chargeoff risk for the portion of our heloc portfolio subject to reset periods in the future include improved loantovalue ratios resulting from continued home price appreciation stable portfolio credit score profiles and more robust loss mitigation efforts 

factors affecting comparability of our results 

goodwill 

during the 19year period from 1988 to 2007 we completed a series of more than 25 acquisitions of other financial institutions and financial assets and liabilities we accounted for these types of business combinations using the purchase method of accounting under this accounting method the acquired company’s net assets are recorded at fair value at the date of acquisition and the difference between the purchase price and the fair value of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill 

under relevant accounting guidance we are required to review goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that the fair value of any of our business units might be less than its carrying value the valuation of goodwill is dependent on forwardlooking expectations related to the performance of the us economy and our associated financial performance 

 65 

citizens financial group inc 

managements discussion and analysis 

the prolonged delay in the full recovery of the us economy and the impact of that delay on our earnings expectations prompted us to record a 44 billion pretax 41 billion aftertax goodwill impairment as of june 30 2013 related to our consumer banking reporting unit for segment reporting purposes the impairment charge is reflected in other 

although the us economy had at the time demonstrated signs of recovery notably improvements in unemployment and housing the pace and extent of recovery in these indicators as well as in overall gross domestic product lagged behind previous expectations the impact of the slow recovery was most evident in consumer banking the forecasted lower economic growth for the united states coupled with increasing costs of complying with the new regulatory framework in the financial industry resulted in a deceleration of expected growth for consumer banking’s future income which resulted in our recording of a goodwill impairment charge during the second quarter of 2013  we have recorded goodwill impairment charges in the past most recently in 2013  and any further impairment to our goodwill could materially affect our results in any given period as of both december 31 2014  and 2013  we had a carrying value of goodwill of 69 billion  for additional information regarding our goodwill impairment testing see note 1 “significant accounting policies” and note 8 “goodwill” to our audited consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 — financial statements and supplementary data included elsewhere in this report 

investment in our business 

we regularly incur expenses associated with investments in our infrastructure and from 2010  to 2014  we invested more than 13 billion in infrastructure and technology and plan to invest an additional 280 million in 2015  and about 170 million in 2016  these investments which are designed to lower our costs and improve our customer experience include significant programs to enhance our resiliency upgrade customerfacing technology and streamline operations recent significant investments included the 2013  launch of our new teller system new commercial loan platform and new auto loan platform and the 2013  upgrade of the majority of our atm network including equipping more than 1450 atms with advanced deposittaking functionality as well as additional investment in our treasury services platform these investments also involved spending to prepare for the planned rollout of our new mortgage platform we expect that these investments will increase our longterm overall efficiency and add to our capacity to increase revenue 

operating expenses to operate as a fully independent public company 

as part of our transition to a standalone company we expect to incur onetime expenditures of approximately 55 million over the course of 2014 to 2016 including capitalized costs of 18 million as well as ongoing incremental expenses of approximately 34 million per year which were substantially reflected in our runrate at the end of 2014 we expect these ongoing costs will include higher local charges associated with exiting worldwide vendor relationships and incremental expenses to support information technology compliance corporate governance regulatory financial and risk infrastructure that are necessary to enable us to operate as a fully standalone public company 

principal components of operations and key performance metrics used by management 

as a banking institution we manage and evaluate various aspects of both our results of operations and our financial condition we evaluate the levels and trends of the line items included in our balance sheet and statement of operations as well as various financial ratios that are commonly used in our industry we analyze these ratios and financial trends against our own historical performance our budgeted performance and the financial condition and performance of comparable banking institutions in our region and nationally 

the primary line items we use in our key performance metrics to manage and evaluate our statement of operations include net interest income noninterest income total revenue provision for credit losses noninterest expense and net income loss the primary line items we use in our key performance metrics to manage and evaluate our balance sheet data include loans and leases securities allowance for credit losses deposits borrowed funds and derivatives 

net interest income 

net interest income is the difference between the interest earned on interestearning assets usually loans and investment securities and the interest expense incurred in connection with interestbearing liabilities usually deposits and borrowings the level of net interest income is primarily a function of the average balance of interestearning assets the average balance of interestbearing liabilities and the spread between the contractual yield on such assets and the cost of such liabilities net interest income is impacted by the relative mix of interestearning assets and interestbearing liabilities movements in market interest rates levels of nonperforming assets and pricing pressure from competitors the mix of interestearning assets is influenced by loan demand and by management’s continual assessment of the rate of return and relative risk associated with various classes of interestearning assets 

 66 

citizens financial group inc 

managements discussion and analysis 

the mix of interestbearing liabilities is influenced by management’s assessment of the need for lower cost funding sources weighed against relationships with customers and growth requirements and is impacted by competition for deposits in our market and the availability and pricing of other sources of funds 

noninterest income 

the primary components of our noninterest income are service charges and fees card fees trust and investment services fees and securities gains net 

total revenue 

total revenue is the sum of our net interest income and our noninterest income 

provision for credit losses 

the provision for credit losses is the amount of expense that based on our judgment is required to maintain the allowance for credit losses at an amount that reflects probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date and that in management’s judgment is appropriate under relevant accounting guidance the provision for credit losses includes the provision for loan and lease losses as well as the provision for unfunded commitments the determination of the amount of the allowance is complex and involves a high degree of judgment and subjectivity for additional information regarding the provision for credit losses see “—critical accounting estimates—allowance for credit losses” and note 1 “significant accounting policies” and note 5 “allowance for credit losses nonperforming assets and concentrations of credit risk” to our audited consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 — financial statements and supplementary data included elsewhere in this report 

noninterest expense 

noninterest expense includes salaries and employee benefits outside services occupancy expense equipment expense amortization of software goodwill impairment and other operating expenses 

net income loss 

we evaluate our net income based on measures including return on average common equity return on average total assets return on average tangible common equity and efficiency ratio 

loans and leases   

we classify our loans and leases pursuant to the following classes commercial commercial real estate leases residential mortgages home equity loans home equity lines of credit home equity loans serviced by others home equity lines of credit serviced by others automobile student credit cards and other retail 

loans are reported at the amount of their outstanding principal net of chargeoffs unearned income deferred loan origination fees and costs and unamortized premiums or discounts on purchased loans deferred loan origination fees and costs and purchase discounts and premiums are amortized as an adjustment of yield over the life of the loan using the level yield interest method unamortized amounts remaining upon prepayment or sale are recorded as interest income or gain loss on sale respectively credit card receivables include billed and uncollected interest and fees 

  

leases are classified at the inception of the lease by type lease receivables including leveraged leases are reported at the aggregate of lease payments receivable and estimated residual values net of unearned and deferred income including unamortized investment credits lease residual values are reviewed at least annually for otherthantemporary impairment with valuation adjustments recognized currently against noninterest income leveraged leases are reported net of nonrecourse debt unearned income is recognized to yield a level rate of return on the net investment in the leases 

mortgage loans held for sale are carried at fair value as of december 31 2013  other loans held for sale primarily include loans relating to the chicago divestiture and were carried at the lower of cost or fair value 

securities 

our securities portfolio is managed to seek return while maintaining prudent levels of quality market risk and liquidity investments in debt and equity securities are carried in four portfolios available for sale held to maturity trading account assets and other investment securities we determine the appropriate classification at the time of purchase securities in our availableforsale portfolio will be held for indefinite periods of time and may be sold in response to changes in interest rates changes in

citizens financial group inc 

managements discussion and analysis 

prepayment risk or other factors relevant to our asset and liability strategy securities in our availableforsale portfolio are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported in other comprehensive income as a separate component of stockholders’ equity net of taxes securities are classified as held to maturity because we have the ability and intent to hold the securities to maturity and are carried at amortized cost debt and equity securities that are bought and held principally for the purpose of being sold in the near term are classified as trading account assets and are carried at fair value realized and unrealized gains and losses on such assets are reported in noninterest income other investment securities are comprised mainly of fhlb and federal reserve bank stock which are carried at cost 

allowance for credit losses 

our estimate of probable losses in the loan and lease portfolios is recorded in the allowance for loan and lease losses and the reserve for unfunded lending commitments together these are referred to as the allowance for credit losses we evaluate the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses using the following ratios allowance for loan and lease losses as a percentage of total loans and leases allowance for loan and lease losses as a percentage of nonperforming loans and leases and nonperforming loans and leases as a percentage of total loans and leases for additional information see “—critical accounting estimates — allowance for credit losses” and note 1 “significant accounting policies” and note 5 “allowance for credit losses nonperforming assets and concentrations of credit risk” to our audited consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 — financial statements and supplementary data included elsewhere in this report 

deposits 

our deposits include on demand checking checking with interest regular savings money market accounts and term deposits

derivatives 

in prior years we used payfixed interest rate swaps to synthetically lengthen liabilities offsetting duration in fixedrate assets in 2008 we determined that these swaps were no longer needed and have elected to terminate them or allow them to runoff 

during the fourth quarter of 2014  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement to manage the interest rate exposure on our medium term fixedrate borrowings this agreement involves the receipt of fixedrate amounts in exchange for floatingrate interest payments over the life of the agreement 

we also use receivefixed swaps to minimize the exposure to variability in the interest cash flows on our floating rate assets the assets and liabilities recorded for derivatives designated as hedges reflect the market value of these hedge instruments

certain of the above financial measures including return on average tangible common equity return on average total tangible assets and the efficiency ratio are not recognized under gaap we also present noninterest expense net income loss return on average total tangible assets return on average tangible common equity return on average common equity return on average total assets efficiency ratio and net income per average common share basic and diluted excluding the 2013 44 billion pretax 41 billion aftertax goodwill impairment charge in addition we present net income loss and return on average tangible common equity net of goodwill impairment restructuring charges and special items for the years ended december 31 2014  and 2013  we believe these nongaap measures provide useful information to investors because these are among the measures used by our management team to evaluate our operating performance and make daytoday operating decisions in addition we believe goodwill impairment restructuring charges and special items in any period do not reflect the operational performance of the business in that period and accordingly it is useful to consider these line items with and without goodwill impairment restructuring charges and special items we believe this presentation also increases comparability of periodtoperiod results 

we also consider pro forma capital ratios defined by banking regulators but not effective at each year end to be nongaap financial measures since analysts and banking regulators may assess our capital adequacy using these pro forma ratios we believe they are useful to provide investors the ability to assess our capital adequacy on the same basis 

other companies may use similarly titled nongaap financial measures that are calculated differently from the way we calculate such measures accordingly our nongaap financial measures may not be comparable to similar measures used by other companies we caution investors not to place undue reliance on such nongaap measures but instead to consider them with the most directly comparable gaap measure nongaap measures have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for our results reported under gaap

net income loss 

net income totaled 865 million  in 2014 and included 75 million  of aftertax net restructuring charges and special items related to our separation from rbs group efforts to improve processes and enhance efficiencies across the organization and the chicago divestiture these results increased 43 billion  from 2013 which included a 41 billion  aftertax goodwill impairment charge excluding the gain restructuring charges and special items and impairment charge noted above 2014 net income increased 119 million  or 18  from 2013 as the benefit of lower provision for credit losses and higher net interest income was partially offset by the effect of lower noninterest income and increased noninterest expense 

the special items and restructuring charges in 2014 included a 288 million pretax gain 180 million after tax on the sale of the chicagoarea deposits 17 million of pretax expenses 11 million after tax related to the chicago divestiture 97 million of pretax expenses 61 million after tax related to our efficiency initiatives 20 million of pretax expenses 11 million after tax related to our separation from rbs and 35 million of other pretax expenses 22 million after tax related to regulatory initiatives the restructuring charges in 2013 related to our implementation of a new branch image capture system on the teller line which automated several key processes within the branch network and our decision to close certain branches which resulted in lease termination costs and other fixed asset writeoffs

net interest income of 33 billion  in 2014  increased 243 million  or 8  from 31 billion  in 2013  driven by growth in average interestearning assets a reduction in interest rate hedging costs as well as lower deposit costs these benefits were partially offset by the effect of declining loan yields and a continued shift in loan mix to lower yielding loans increased borrowing costs related to our issuance of subordinated debt and the effect of the chicago divestiture average interestearning assets of 1162 billion  in 2014  increased 90 billion  from 2013  driven by a 53 billion  increase in the investment securities portfolio a 22 billion  increase in commercial loans a 16 billion  increase in residential mortgages and a 22 billion  increase in automobile loans partially offset by a 20 billion  decrease in home equity outstandings a 54 million reduction in student loans and a 267 million decrease in other retail loans 

  2014  net interest margin of 283  remained broadly stable compared to 285  in 2013  despite continued pressure from the relatively persistent low interestrate environment average interestearning asset yields continued to decline at a pace that exceeded our ability to reduce our cost of interestbearing deposits 2014  average interestearning asset yields of 314  declined 11  basis points from 325  in 2013  largely reflecting a 13  basis point decline in the loan and lease portfolio yield despite a five  basis point improvement in the securities portfolio yield the decline in loan and lease yields was driven by the effect of a reduction in higheryielding consumer real estate secured outstandings in addition intense industrywide competition for commercial loans continued to compress spreads on new originations and resulted in additional downward pressure on overall loan yields investment portfolio income of 619 million  for the year ended december 31 2014  increased 142 million  or 30  compared to the year ended december 31 2013  

  total interestbearing deposit costs of 156 million  in 2014  decreased 60 million  or 28  from 216 million  in 2013  and reflected an eight  basis point decrease in the rate paid on deposits to 024  from 032  the cost of term deposits decreased to 065  in 2014  from 091  in 2013  while rates on money market and savings declined to 019  in 2014  from 025  in 2013  due to the historically low interest rate environment many deposit products have hit pricing floors at or near zero limiting further rate reduction and thus compressing margins 

the total borrowed funds costs of 203 million  in 2014  declined 24 million  or 11  from 227 million  in 2013  driven by the benefit of a 101 million  reduction in payfixed swap costs which was partially offset by an increase in longterm borrowed funds costs largely related to our issuance of subordinated debt 

total borrowed funds rates declined to 151  in 2014 from 653  in 2013 within the federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreement category and other shortterm borrowed funds categories payfixed swap expense declined to 99 million  in 2014 from 200 million  in 2013  excluding the impact of hedging costs 2014  borrowed funds costs were 078  compared to 116  in 2013

managements discussion and analysis 

noninterest income of 17 billion  in 2014  increased 46 million  or 3  from 16 billion  in 2013  driven by a 288 million pretax gain on the chicago divestiture which was recorded in other income and a 38 million increase in capital markets fees partially offset by a 116 million decrease in net securities gains an 82 million decrease in mortgage banking fees and a 66 million decrease in service charges and fees mortgage banking fees reflected overall lower origination volume the decision to hold more loans onbalance sheet and were also negatively impacted by a reduction in the recovery of mortgage servicing rights valuations from the prior year the decrease in service charges and fees are driven by lower personal overdraft fees resulting from a november 2013 change to our checkposting methodology 

provision for credit losses 

provision for credit losses of 319 million  in 2014  decreased 160 million  from 479 million  in 2013  driven by a 178 million  reduction in net chargeoffs additionally while overall credit quality continued to improve in 2014 the rate of improvement slowed relative to 2013 as a result 2014 provision for credit losses included a release of 4 million from the allowance for credit losses the amount by which net chargeoffs exceeded the provision compared with a release of 22 million in 2013 the provision for loan and lease losses is the result of a detailed analysis performed to estimate an appropriate and adequate allowance for loan and lease losses “alll” the total provision for credit losses included the provision for loan and lease losses as well as the provision for unfunded commitments refer to “—analysis of financial condition — allowance for credit losses and nonperforming assets” for more information 

noninterest expense 

the following table displays the significant components of our noninterest expense for the periods indicated 



  

noninterest expense of 34 billion  in 2014  decreased 43 billion from 2013  which included a 44 billion  pretax goodwill impairment charge our 2014  noninterest expense included 169 million  of pretax restructuring charges and special items largely related to our separation from rbs group as well as ongoing efforts to improve processes and enhance efficiencies across the organization compared with 26 million of restructuring charges and special items in 2013 the 2014 charge included 78 million in outside services 44 million in salaries and employee benefits 16 million in occupancy 6 million in software 4 million in equipment and 21 million in other operating expense excluding the restructuring charges and special items and the goodwill impairment noninterest expense remained relatively stable as the benefit of our efficiency initiatives helped offset investment in the business to drive future earnings growth as well as higher regulatory costs see note 21 “exit costs and restructuring reserves” to our audited consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 — financial statements and supplementary data included elsewhere in this report 

provision benefit for income taxes 

in 2014  we recorded income tax expense of 403 million  compared to an income tax benefit of 42 million  in 2013  the effective tax rates for the years ended december 31 2014  and 2013  were 318  and 12  respectively the increase in the effective rate largely reflected the tax rate impact of the goodwill impairment charge taken in 2013  goodwill not deductible for tax purposes accounted for 784  of the total goodwill impairment charge and generated a reduction of 351  in our effective tax rate for the year ended december 31 2013  

additionally the effective income tax rate will be affected in future periods by the impact of the adoption of accounting standard update no 201401 “accounting for investments in qualified affordable housing projects” we expect this change in accounting method to increase the 2015  effective income tax rate by approximately 24 percentage points however this is not

at december 31 2014  we reported a net deferred tax liability of 493 million  compared to a 199 million  liability at december 31 2013  the increase in the net deferred tax liability was attributable to the utilization of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards of 76 million  which decreased the deferred tax asset a decrease in the tax effect on other comprehensive income “oci” of 153 million  which also decreased the deferred tax asset and an increase in the deferred tax liability related to temporary differences of 65 million  for further discussion see note 14 “income taxes” to our audited consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 — financial statements and supplementary data included elsewhere in this report

provision for credit losses is allocated to each business segment based on actual net chargeoffs that have been recognized by the business segment the difference between the consolidated provision for credit losses and the business segments’ net chargeoffs is reflected in other 

noninterest income and expense directly managed by each business segment including fees service charges salaries and benefits and other direct revenues and costs are accounted for within each segment’s financial results in a manner similar to our audited consolidated financial statements occupancy costs are allocated based on utilization of facilities by the business segment generally operating losses are charged to the business segment when the loss event is realized in a manner similar to a loan chargeoff noninterest expenses incurred by centrally managed operations or business segments that directly support another business segment’s operations are charged to the applicable business segment based on its utilization of those services 

income taxes are assessed to each business segment at a standard tax rate with the residual tax expense or benefit to arrive at the consolidated effective tax rate included in other 

developing and applying methodologies used to allocate items among the business segments is a dynamic process accordingly financial results may be revised periodically as management systems are enhanced methods of evaluating performance or product lines change or our organizational structure changes

net interest income in 2014  increased 226 million  to 77 million  compared to an expense of 149 million  in 2013  the increase was driven by the benefit of a 51 billion  increase in average investment securities a reduction in interest rate swap costs and an increase in residual net interest income related to funds transfer pricing partially offset by higher wholesale funding costs and a 13 billion  decrease in average noncore loan balances 

noninterest income in 2014  increased 132 million  driven by the 288 million  pretax gain on the chicago divestiture excluding the gain noninterest income decreased 156 million  driven by a 116 million  reduction in securities gains and higher net losses on lowincome housing investments which are more than offset by increased tax credits

net interest income of 31 billion in 2013 decreased 169 million or 5 from 32 billion in 2012 and reflected a four basis point decline in net interest margin to 285 the decrease in net interest income was driven by a reduction in earning asset yields given the relatively persistent lowrate environment as well as a decrease in loan and securities portfolio balances which were partially offset by a reduction in payfixed swap costs and improved deposit spreads average interestearning assets decreased 40 billion driven by a 29 billion decrease in consumer real estate secured portfolios a 23 billion decrease in the investment securities portfolio and a 385 million decrease in student and other installment loans which were partially offset by a 11 billion increase in total commercial loans and a 581 million increase in auto loans 

the four basis point decrease in net interest margin reflected the effect of the relatively persistent lowrate environment which led to a decline in earning asset yields that outpaced our ability to reduce the cost of interestbearing liabilities the decline in earning asset yields reflected continued prepayment of higher yielding consumer real estate secured loans as well as the contractual amortization of higher yield portfolios which were entered into in higher interest rate environments in addition intense industrywide competition for loans compressed spreads on new originations and resulted in downward pressure on loan yields to a lesser extent rates on interestbearing deposits also declined compared to 2012 industry wide net interest margins experienced downward pressure as higher rate loan and securities balances ran off and deposit rates approached floors beneath which they cannot be reduced further 

the net yield on average interestearning assets decreased 20 basis points to 325 in 2013 from 345 in 2012 reflecting a 17 basis point decline in the loan and lease portfolio yield and a 35 basis point decline in the investment portfolio yield from 2012 the decline in average yields largely reflected the effect of the continued lowrate environment as new loans and securities were issued at lower rates and prepayment speeds on higher rate fixed assets in the portfolio increased investment portfolio income of 488 million decreased 136 million or 22 from 2012 and the yield on the portfolio declined 35 basis points to 229 these results were impacted by our strategic decision to slow down reinvestment activity in the first half of 2013 given extremely low levels of market rates 

our total interestbearing deposit costs in 2013 decreased 159 million or 42 from 375 million in 2012 and reflected a 23 basis point decrease in the rate paid on deposits to 032 from 055 in 2012 the rates paid on term deposits declined to 091 from 180 in 2012 as a result of the historically low interest rate environment many deposit products have hit pricing floors at or near zero limiting further rate reductions and thus compressing margin the total cost of borrowed funds increased to 653 from 311 in 2012 due in part to additional subordinated debt issued in 2013 and the full expense impact of the subordinated debt issued in 2012 and also due to the impact of allocated hedge expense and netting of repurchase agreements excluding the cost of the hedge expense and netting the total borrowed funds rates were 311 and 347 for 2013 and 2012 respectively

banking fees and card fees service charges and fees of 640 million decreased 9 largely on lower account volume mortgage banking fees of 153 million decreased 36 million or 19 from 189 million in 2012 the decrease was primarily driven by lower loan sale gains reflecting the decision to retain more loans on our balance sheet which was partially offset by higher mortgage servicing rights valuations card fees of 234 million declined 15 million or 6 compared to 249 million in 2012 driven by lower transaction volumes net gains on the sale of securities of 144 million increased 49 million or 52 from 95 million in 2012 primarily reflecting the sale of higher yielding investment securities other income of 112 million increased 21 million or 23 from 2012 primarily due to a 75 million gain on the sale of visa class b shares offset by a 23 million loss on the sale of a commercial real estate portfolio recorded in 2012 excluding the gain on the sale of visa class b shares and the loss on commercial real estate other income increased 73 million driven by higher derivatives income leasing income and a gain on sale of warrants

provision for credit losses of 479 million in 2013 increased 66 million or 16 from 413 million in 2012 despite a 374 million decline in net chargeoffs the increase in the provision for credit losses reflected growth in the commercial loan portfolio and recognition of incremental loss exposure related to expected heloc payment shock additionally while overall credit quality continued to improve in 2013 the rate of improvement slowed relative to 2012 as a result 2013 provision for credit losses included a release of 22 million from the allowance for credit losses the amount by which net chargeoffs exceeded the provision compared with a release of 462 million in 2012 for further information regarding the expected heloc payment shock see “— key factors affecting our business — heloc payment shock” 

noninterest expense 

the following table displays the significant components of our noninterest expense for the periods indicated 



noninterest expense of 77 billion in 2013 increased 42 billion from 35 billion in 2012 and included a second quarter 44 billion goodwill impairment charge as described below excluding the goodwill impairment noninterest expense of 32 billion declined 213 million or 6 from 35 billion in 2012 results in 2012 included a 138 million litigation settlement related to overdraft protection and a 77 million settlement of defined benefit pension plan obligations to vested former employees partially offset by a net 5 million reversal of prior restructuring charges excluding these unusual items and a 26 million restructuring charge in 2013 noninterest expense decreased 29 million or 1 driven by lower other operating expense and salaries and employee benefits 

in the second quarter of 2013 we recorded a 44 billion goodwill impairment charge driven by a deceleration of the expected future earnings associated with our consumer banking reporting unit as compared to our prior expectations although the us economy has demonstrated signs of recovery including notable improvements in unemployment and housing the pace and extent of recovery in these indicators as well as in overall gross domestic product have lagged behind previous expectations and interest rates have remained at or near historically low levels for a protracted period of time lower economic growth rates for the united states coupled with increased costs to comply with the new regulatory framework in the financial services industry resulted in a deceleration of the expected growth rate for future earnings associated with the consumer banking reporting unit which caused us to record a goodwill impairment charge during the second quarter of 2013 for segment reporting purposes the impairment charge is reflected in other and the remaining carrying value of goodwill totaled 69 billion as of december 31 2013 see note 8 “goodwill” to our audited consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 — financial statements and supplementary data included elsewhere in this report for further information

provision benefit for income taxes 

in 2013 we recorded an income tax benefit of 42 million compared to 381 million of income tax expense in 2012 the effective tax rates for the years ended december 31 2013 and 2012 were 12 and 372 respectively the decrease in the effective rate was mainly due to the tax rate impact of the goodwill impairment in calculating our income tax benefit as well as the effect of a 25 million charge related to a state tax settlement in 2012 goodwill not deductible for tax purposes accounted for 784 of the total goodwill impairment charge and generated a reduction of 351 in our effective tax rate for the year ended december 31 2013 during 2012 we recorded a state tax settlement charge for the years 2003 through 2008 related to our real estate investment trust and various passive investment companies for more information on our 2012 tax settlement see note 14 “income taxes” to our audited consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 — financial statements and supplementary data included elsewhere in this report

noninterest income and expense directly managed by each business segment including fees service charges salaries and benefits and other direct revenues and costs are accounted for within each segment’s financial results in a manner similar to our audited consolidated financial statements occupancy costs are allocated based on utilization of facilities by the business segment generally operating losses are charged to the business segment when the loss event is realized in a manner similar to a loan chargeoff noninterest expenses incurred by centrally managed operations or business segments that directly support another business segment’s operations are charged to the applicable business segment based on its utilization of those services 

income taxes are assessed to each business segment at a standard tax rate with the residual tax expense or benefit to arrive at the consolidated effective tax rate included in other 

developing and applying methodologies used to allocate items among the business segments is a dynamic process accordingly financial results may be revised periodically as management systems are enhanced methods of evaluating performance or product lines change or our organizational structure changes

consumer banking net income of 242 million in 2013 increased 57 million or 31 from 2012 as a 5 decrease in revenue was more than offset by a 6 decrease in noninterest expense and a 100 million decrease in provision for credit losses 2012 unusual items included a 75 million 48 million after tax benefit in revenue relating to a gain on the sale of visa class b shares and a 138 million 87 million after tax settlement charge in noninterest expense associated with overdraft litigation excluding these items net income increased 18 million as the benefit of lower provision for credit losses and continued expense discipline more than offset the lower revenue reflecting continued pressure from the relatively persistent lowrate environment as well as the impact of regulatory changes on service charges and card fees 

net interest income of 22 billion in 2013 declined 21 million or 1 largely driven by a 3 decrease in earning assets and a reduction in deposit spreads the average loan portfolio declined 13 billion to 451 billion driven by a 18 billion decrease in home equity balances given industry wide higher levels of mortgage refinance activity in 2013 we originated 57 billion in mortgages compared with 79 billion in 2012 we sold 67 of 2013 originations compared to 70 in 2012 average deposits grew 2 to 722 billion reflecting a 30 billion increase in money market deposits partially offset by a 24 billion decrease in certificates of deposit 

noninterest income of 10 billion decreased 162 million or 14 from 2012 which included the benefit of the 75 million gain on the sale of visa class b shares excluding this gain noninterest income decreased 87 million driven by a 53 million decrease in service charges and a 36 million decrease in mortgage banking fees the decrease in mortgage banking fees reflected a 22 billion decrease in origination volumes as well as lower gains on the sale of mortgages as secondary market spreads narrowed gains on sale of mortgages decreased 77 million and volume related fees declined 28 million partially offset by the recovery of mortgage servicing rights valuations and lower amortization expense

noninterest expense of 25 billion decreased 169 million or 6 from 2012 which included the 138 million overdraft settlement excluding this settlement charge noninterest expense decreased 31 million driven by lower salaries and benefits and branch related costs partially offset by higher commissions expense 

provision for credit losses of 308 million decreased 100 million or 24 from 2012 largely reflecting the benefit of decreased chargeoffs in the residential real estate secured portfolio as well as general improvement in the credit environment

commercial banking net income of 514 million in 2013 increased 61 million or 13 from 453 million in 2012 driven by growth in noninterest income and continued improvement in credit quality total revenue rose 3 reflecting an 11 increase in noninterest income and relatively flat net interest income 

net interest income of 10 billion in 2013 remained relatively flat with the prior year as the benefit of loan growth of 7 largely in middle market midcorporate and franchise lending was offset by a 21 basis point decline in net interest margin given the relatively persistent lowrate environment 

noninterest income of 389 million in 2013 increased 40 million or 11 from 2012 largely due to higher interest rate products and leasing income which was partially offset by lower foreign exchange and trade finance fees 

noninterest expense of 635 million in 2013 increased 10 million driven by higher salary and benefits cost as well as continued investment in technology and risk management 

average loans and leases increased 21 billion or 7 in 2013 due to strong new loan origination activity particularly in the second half of 2013 in commercial finance average deposit balances were relatively flat at 175 billion despite a 256 million increase in noninterestbearing demand deposits

other 



a net loss of 42 billion was recorded for the year ended december 31 2013 which included a pretax goodwill impairment charge of 44 billion excluding the goodwill impairment the net loss was 102 million compared with net income of 5 million in 2012 2013 results reflected the benefit of higher noninterest income and lower noninterest expense which was more than offset by higher provision for credit losses and a reduction in net interest income total revenue of 69 million in 2013 decreased by 56 million or 45 from 125 million in 2012 

net interest income in 2013 decreased 143 million to a loss of 149 million compared to a loss of 6 million in 2012 the decrease was driven by lower average investment portfolio balances of 23 billion a 22 billion decrease in average noncore loan balances and a decrease in residual net interest income related to funds transfer pricing which was partially offset by the benefit of interest rate swaps used for hedging assets and liabilities 

noninterest income of 218 million in 2013 increased 87 million or 66 from 131 million in 2012 which included a 23 million loss on sale of noncore loans noninterest income in 2013 also included higher net gains on sale of securities available for sale of 65 million 

the provision for credit losses within other mainly represents the residual change in the consolidated allowance for credit losses after attributing the respective net chargeoffs to the consumer banking and commercial banking segments it also includes net chargeoffs related to the noncore portfolio the provision totaled 178 million in 2013 and was an increase of 236 million from a negative provision of 58 million in 2012 noncore net chargeoffs were 195 million and 393 million in 2013 and 2012 respectively resulting from improved credit quality and continued runoff in the portfolio 2013 provision for credit losses included a release of 22 million from the allowance for credit losses the amount by which net chargeoffs exceeded the provision compared with a release of 462 million in 2012 

noninterest expense of 45 billion increased 44 billion from 141 million in 2012 and included a 44 billion goodwill impairment charge noninterest expense excluding goodwill impairment of 87 million in 2013 decreased 54 million or 38 from 141 million in 2012 2013 results included 26 million of restructuring charges and 2012 results included a 77 million settlement of defined benefit pension plan obligations to vested former employees partially offset by a net 5 million reversal of prior restructuring charges 

total assets included 21 billion and 48 billion of goodwill related to the consumer banking and commercial banking reporting units respectively for further information regarding the reconciliation of segment results to gaap results see note 23

noncore assets   

the table below shows the composition of our noncore assets as of the dates indicated 



1 our sbo portfolio consists of home equity loans and lines that were originally serviced by others we now service a portion of this portfolio internally 

noncore assets are primarily loans inconsistent with our strategic goals generally as a result of geographic location industry product type or risk level we have actively managed these loans down since they were designated as noncore on june 30 2009 between that time and december 31 2014  the portfolio has decreased 174 billion  including principal repayments of 94 billion  chargeoffs of 39 billion  transfers back to the core portfolio of 28 billion  and sales of 13 billion  

transfers from noncore back to core are handled on an individual request basis and managed through the chief credit officer for our noncore portfolio the rationale can vary and in the past some loan portfolio transfers have been approved after determination that the original decision to place them in noncore was not deemed appropriate individual loans can be reconsidered when the customer prospects change—typically related to situations where a nonstrategic customer becomes a strategic customer due to growth or a new credit request that was previously considered to be unlikely 

noncore assets totaled 31 billion  as of december 31 2014  down 19  from december 31 2013  driven by principal repayments of 604 million  commercial noncore loan balances declined 42  compared to december 31 2013  ending at 284 million  compared to 489 million  at december 31 2013  retail noncore loan balances of 28 billion  decreased 16  or 520 million  compared to december 31 2013  

the largest component of our noncore portfolio is the home equity portfolio serviced by other firms “sbo” the sbo portfolio is a liquidating portfolio consisting of pools of home equity loans and lines of credit purchased between 2003 and 2007 although our sbo portfolio consists of loans that were initially serviced by others we now service a portion of this portfolio internally sbo balances serviced externally totaled 11 billion  and 13 billion  as of december 31 2014  and december 31 2013  respectively the sbo portfolio has been closed to new purchases since the third quarter of 2007 with exposure down to 18 billion  as of december 31 2014  compared to 22 billion  as of december 31 2013  the sbo portfolio represented 6  of the retail real estate secured portfolio and 4  of the overall retail loan portfolio as of december 31 2014  

  the credit profile of the sbo portfolio was significantly weaker than the core real estate portfolio with a weightedaverage refreshed fico score of 713  and combined loantovalue “cltv” of 889  as of december 31 2014  the proportion of the portfolio in a second lien subordinated position was 95  with 72  of the portfolio in outoffootprint geographies including 29  in california nevada arizona and florida

sbo credit performance continued to improve in 2014 driven by continued portfolio liquidation the weakest performing loans have already been charged off more effective account servicing and collection strategies and improvements in the real estate market sbo portfolio chargeoffs of 41 million or 21 of sbo loans in 2014 improved from 118 million or 47 in 2013 

allowance for credit losses and nonperforming assets 

we and our banking subsidiaries citizens bank national association and citizens bank of pennsylvania maintain an allowance for credit losses consisting of an alll and a reserve for unfunded lending commitments this allowance is created through charges to income or provision for credit losses and is maintained at an appropriate level adequate to absorb anticipated losses and is determined in accordance with gaap for further information on our processes to determine our allowance for credit losses see “—critical accounting estimates — allowance for credit losses” note 5 “allowance for credit losses nonperforming assets and concentrations of credit risk” and note 1 “significant accounting policies” to our audited consolidated financial statements both in part ii item 8 — financial statements and supplementary data included elsewhere in this report 

  

the allowance for credit losses totaled 13 billion  at december 31 2014  and december 31 2013  our allowance for loan and lease losses was 13  of total loans and leases and 109  of nonperforming loans and leases as of december 31 2014  compared with 14  and 86  as of december 31 2013  the total loan portfolio credit performance continued to improve across all credit measures in the year ended december 31 2014  net chargeoffs for the year ended december 31 2014  of 323 million  decreased 36  compared to 501 million  for the year ended december 31 2013  with a reduction in virtually every portfolio the portfolio annualized net chargeoff rate declined to 036  for the year ended december 31 2014  from 059  for the year ended december 31 2013  the delinquency rate improved to 15  as of december 31 2014  from 19  at december 31 2013  nonperforming loans and leases totaled 11 billion  or 12  of the total portfolio as of december 31 2014  as compared to 14 billion  or 17  of the total loan portfolio as of december 31 2013  at december 31 2014  624 million  of nonperforming loans and leases had been designated as impaired and had no specific allowance because they had been written down to the fair value of their collateral these loans included 550 million  of retail loans and 74 million  of commercial loans excluding impaired loans that have been written down to their net realizable value the allowance to nonperforming loans ratio totaled 251  at december 31 2014  as compared to 151  at december 31 2013  

  

commercial loan asset quality 

  

our commercial loan portfolio consists of traditional commercial and commercial real estate loans the portfolio is focused primarily on infootprint customers where our local delivery model provides for strong client connectivity 

  

for commercial loans and leases we use regulatory classification ratings to monitor credit quality loans with a “pass” rating are those that we believe will be fully repaid in accordance with the contractual loan terms commercial loans and leases that are “criticized” are those that have some weakness that indicates an increased probability of future loss see note 5 “allowance for credit losses nonperforming assets and concentrations of credit risk” to our audited consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 — financial statements and supplementary data included elsewhere in this report 

during the year ended december 31 2014  the quality of the commercial loan portfolio improved as of december 31 2014  total criticized loans decreased to 45  or 19 billion  of the commercial loan portfolio compared to 49  or 19 billion  at december 31 2013  commercial real estate criticized balances decreased 218  to 58  or 455 million  of the commercial real estate portfolio compared to 84  or 582 million  as of december 31 2013  commercial real estate accounted for 236  of the criticized loans as of december 31 2014  compared to 304  as of december 31 2013  

  

nonperforming balances and chargeoffs displayed a positive trend in 2014 as of december 31 2014  nonperforming commercial balances decreased 101 million  or 381  to 164 million  compared to 265 million  as of december 31 2013  with a 704  decline in commercial real estate nonperforming loans over the same period as of december 31 2014  nonperforming commercial loans stood at 04  of the commercial loan portfolio compared to 07  as of december 31 2013  net chargeoffs in our commercial loan portfolio for the year ended december 31 2014  decreased 36 million  ending in a net recovery position of 15 million  compared to a net chargeoff of 21 million  for the year ended december 31 2013  primarily due to lower gross chargeoffs and continued recovery of prior period losses the improvement was driven by improved economic conditions and a strategic focus on high quality new business see “—key factors affecting our business—credit trends” for further details

retail loan asset quality 

  

for retail loans we primarily use the loan’s payment and delinquency status to monitor credit quality the further a loan is past due the greater the likelihood of future credit loss these credit quality indicators are continually updated and monitored our retail loan portfolio remains predominantly focused on lending across the new england midatlantic and midwest regions with continued geographic expansion outside the footprint with the auto finance and student lending portfolios originations within the footprint are primarily initiated through the branch network whereas outoffootprint lending is driven by indirect auto loans in dealer networks and through purchase agreements and student loans via our online platform 

the credit composition of our retail loan portfolio at december 31 2014  remained favorable and well positioned across all product lines with an average refreshed fico score of 755  in line with december 31 2013  our real estate cltv ratio is calculated as the mortgage amount divided by the appraised value of the property and was 654  as of december 31 2014  compared to 678  as of december 31 2013  excluding the sbo portfolio the real estate combined loantovalue was 638  as of december 31 2014  compared to 651  as of december 31 2013  asset quality remains stable with a net chargeoff rate core and noncore of 070  for the year ended december 31 2014  a decrease of 33  basis points from the year ended december 31 2013  

  

nonperforming retail loans as a percentage of total retail loans were 19  as of december 31 2014  which is an improvement of 61  basis points from december 31 2013  retail nonaccrual loans of 930 million at december 31 2014 decreased 188 million from 11 billion at december 31 2013 as continued improvement in real estate secured loans were modestly offset by increases in student loans and automobile loans largely reflecting expected portfolio seasoning given increased portfolio growth the improvement in nonperforming retail loans was primarily driven by transfers of loans from nonaccrual to accrual status

troubled debt restructuring 

  

troubled debt restructuring “tdr” is the classification given to a loan that has been restructured in a manner that grants a concession to a borrower that is experiencing financial hardship that we would not otherwise make tdrs typically result from our loss mitigation efforts and are undertaken in order to improve the likelihood of recovery and continuity of the relationship our loan modifications are handled on a case by case basis and are negotiated to achieve mutually agreeable terms that maximize loan collectability and meet our borrower’s financial needs the types of concessions include interest rate reductions term extensions principal forgiveness and other modifications to the structure of the loan that fall outside lending policy depending on the specific facts and circumstances of the customer restructuring can involve loans moving to nonaccrual remaining on nonaccrual or continuing on accrual status   as of december 31 2014  we had 12 billion  classified as retail tdrs of which 387 million  were in nonaccrual status within this nonaccrual population 470  were current in payment tdrs generally return to accrual status once repayment capacity and appropriate payment history can be established tdrs are evaluated for impairment individually loans are classified as tdrs until paid off sold or refinanced at market terms

our securities portfolio is managed to seek return while maintaining prudent levels of quality market risk and liquidity the following table presents our available for sale and held to maturity portfolios 



as of december 31 2014  the fair value of the securities portfolio increased by 36 billion  or 18  to 238 billion  compared to 203 billion  as of december 31 2013  reflecting our decision to continue to increase interestearning assets to a level more consistent with our capital levels and the balance sheet profile of regional bank peers as of december 31 2014  the portfolio had a weightedaverage expected life of 42  years compared with 46 years as of december 31 2013 

the securities portfolio included higher quality highly liquid investments reflecting our ongoing commitment to maintaining appropriate contingent liquidity and pledging capacity us government guaranteed notes and government sponsored entity issued mortgagebacked securities represented the majority of the securities portfolio holdings the portfolio composition has also been dominated by holdings backed by mortgages so that they can be pledged to the fhlbs this has become increasingly important due to the enhanced liquidity requirements of the liquidity coverage ratio for further discussion of the liquidity coverage ratios see “regulation and supervision — liquidity standards” in part i item 1 — business included elsewhere in this report

reflecting the impact of both growth in interestearning assets and a 53 billion decrease in deposits held for sale related to the chicago divestiture 

as of december 31 2014  our total contingent liquidity was 195 billion consisting of net cash at the federal reserve which is defined as total excess cash balances held at the federal reserve banks plus federal funds sold minus federal funds purchased of 15 billion unencumbered highquality securities totaling 145 billion  and unused fhlb capacity of approximately 35 billion  additionally unencumbered loans pledged at the federal reserve banks of 83 billion  created total available liquidity of approximately 278 billion 

longterm borrowed funds 

longterm borrowed funds of 46 billion as of december 31 2014 increased 32 billion from 14 billion as of december 31 2013 driven by a 15 billion increase related to our issuance of senior unsecured debt and a 10 billion issuance of subordinated debt in connection with our capital exchange transactions with rbs group in 2014 cbna established a 30 billion global bank note program “program” and on december 1 2014 issued 15 billion in senior notes consisting of 750 million of threeyear fixedrate notes and 750 million of fiveyear fixedrate notes this program represents a key source of unsecured stable funding and further diversified funding sources for cbna as we continue to migrate to a more peerlike funding structure for the consolidated enterprise 

  

access to additional funding through repurchase agreements collateralized borrowed funds or asset sales is available additionally there is capacity to grow deposits while access to shortterm wholesale markets is limited we have been able to meet our funding needs for the medium term with deposits and collateralized borrowed funds 

derivatives 

we use derivatives to manage interestrate risk which are grouped into three categories according to hedged item and strategy 

historically we used payfixed swaps to synthetically lengthen liabilities and offset duration in fixedrate assets since 2008 we elected to terminate or runoff the existing payfixed swap notional balances which totaled 10 billion  as of december 31 2014  compared with 15 billion as of december 31 2013 payfixedrates on the swaps ranged from 418 to 430 in 2014 compared with 418 to 547 in 2013 we received the daily federal funds effective rate on these swaps 

we use receivefixed swaps to minimize the exposure to variability in the interest cash flows on our floating rate assets as of december 31 2014  receivefixed swap hedges of floatingrate loans totaled 40 billion unchanged from december 31 2013 at december 31 2014 the fixed rate range was 178 to 204 unchanged from december 31 2013 and we paid onemonth london interbank offered rate “libor” on these swaps 

in december 2014 we entered into a 750 million receivefixed interestrate swap agreement to manage the interest rate exposure on our fiveyear medium term fixedrate debt issued in december 2014 this agreement converts the 245 fixedrate debt coupon to threemonth libor plus 79 basis points we receive fixed rate at 166 on the swap agreement and pay threemonth libor 

we also sell interest rate swaps and foreign exchange forwards to commercial customers offsetting swap and forward agreements are simultaneously transacted to minimize our market risk associated with the customer derivative products the assets and liabilities recorded for derivatives not designated as hedges reflect the market value of these transactions

1 the notional or contractual amount of interest rate derivatives and foreign exchange contracts is the amount upon which interest and other payments under the contract are based for interest rate derivatives the notional amount is typically not exchanged therefore notional amounts should not be taken as the measure of credit or market risk as they tend to greatly overstate the true economic risk of these contracts 

2 amounts represent the impact of legally enforceable master netting agreements that allow us to settle positive and negative positions

capital 

as a bank holding company and a financial holding company we are subject to regulation and supervision by the federal reserve board our primary subsidiaries are our two insured depository institutions citizens bank national association “cbna” a national banking association whose primary federal regulator is the occ and citizens bank of pennsylvania “cbpa” a pennsylvaniacharted savings bank regulated by the department of banking of the commonwealth of pennsylvania and supervised by the fdic as its primary federal regulator 

under the basel i capital framework in effect for us at december 31 2014 the federal reserve board required us to maintain minimum levels with respect to our total riskbased capital tier 1 riskbased capital and tier 1 leverage ratios the minimum standards for the total riskbased capital ratio the ratio of our total riskbased capital which is the sum of our tier 1 and tier 2 capital as defined by federal reserve board regulation to total riskweighted assets and the tier 1 riskbased capital ratio the ratio of our tier 1 capital to total riskweighted assets were 80  and 40  respectively the minimum tier 1 leverage ratio the ratio of a banking organization’s tier 1 capital to total adjusted quarterly average total assets as defined for regulatory purposes was 30  for bank holding companies that either had the highest supervisory rating or have implemented the federal

reserve board’s riskadjusted measure for market risk the minimum tier 1 leverage ratio for all other bank holding companies including our company was 40  unless a different minimum was specified by the federal reserve board 

in july 2013 the us bank regulatory agencies approved final regulatory capital rules that implemented the basel iii capital framework and certain provisions of the doddfrank act basel iii changes tier 1 and total capital calculations and formally established a cet1 capital ratio basel iii also introduced new minimum capital ratios and buffer requirements and a supplementary leverage ratio changed the composition of regulatory capital revised the adequately capitalized minimum requirements under the prompt corrective action framework expanded and modified the risksensitive calculation of riskweighted assets for credit and market risk and introduced a standardized approach for the calculation of riskweighted assets we were required to comply with these rules beginning on january 1 2015 with certain aspects of the rules phasing in through 2018 under basel iii the minimum standards including the capital conservation buffer for the total riskbased capital ratio the cet1 ratio and the tier 1 riskbased capital ratio are 105 70 and 85 respectively and the minimum tier 1 leverage ratio is 40 for further discussion of the capital rules to which we are subject see “regulation and supervision” in part i item 1 — business included elsewhere in this report 

the table below presents our regulatory capital ratios as of december 31 2014  and 2013  respectively actual basel i ratios and pro forma basel iii ratios which include estimated impacts of fully phasedin basel iii and standardized approach riskweighted assets requirements remain well above the then applicable basel i and future basel iii minima

at december 31 2014  an increase or decrease in our regulatory capital ratios by one basis point would require a change of 10 million  in tier 1 common equity tier 1 capital or total capital we could also increase our tier 1 common equity or tier 1 riskbased capital ratios by one basis point with a reduction in riskweighted assets of 76 million  or increase our total capital ratio by one basis point with a reduction in riskweighted assets of 63 million

regulatory capital ratios and capital composition 

the following table presents our capital ratios under the basel i capital framework in effect for us at december 31 2014 



tier 1 riskbased capital was 132 billion  at december 31 2014  a decrease of 128 million  compared to december 31 2013  the decrease was primarily due to our continuing effort to bring the mix in capital in line with peer banks in 2014  we made special dividend payments of 666 million to rbs and repurchased common shares of 334 million from rbs the issuance of tier 2 subordinated debt to rbs funded both of these transactions we paid quarterly common dividends of 140 million supported by net income of 865 million amortization of the deferred tax liability for goodwill of 70 million a capital surplus increase of 67 million due to sharebased compensation transactions and disallowed servicing assets of 5 million factored into the year over year difference 

for the year ended december 31 2014  total riskbased capital increased 896 million  to 168 billion  primarily due to the issuance of tier 2 subordinated debt to fund the special dividend payments and repurchase of common shares mentioned above along with the aforementioned tier 1 impacts and an elimination of the deduction for excess reserves resulting in an increase in capital of 27 million 

the tier 1 leverage ratio decreased approximately 100  basis points in 2014  driven by an increase in adjusted quarterly average total assets resulting from a 60 basis point increase in commercial and a 50 basis point increase in retail automobile loan exposures offset by a 10 basis point decrease in securities

the following table presents our capital composition under the basel i capital framework in effect for us at december 31 2014 as of 

riskweighted assets at december 31 2014  were 1060 billion  an increase of 73 billion  as compared to december 31 2013  the primary drivers for this change were increases in commercial and consumer auto loan exposures which increased riskweighted assets by 38 billion and 35 billion respectively 

capital adequacy 

our assessment of capital adequacy begins with our risk appetite and risk management framework which provides for the identification measurement and management of material risks required capital is determined for actualforecasted risk portfolios using applicable regulatory capital methodologies including estimated impacts of approved and proposed regulatory changes that will or may apply to future periods key analytical frameworks which enable the comprehensive assessment of capital adequacy versus unexpected loss supplement our base case forecast these supplemental frameworks include integrated stress testing as well as an internal capital adequacy requirement that builds on internally assessed economic capital requirements a robust governance framework supports our capital planning process this process includes capital management policies and procedures that document capital adequacy metrics and limits as well as our comprehensive capital contingency plan and the active engagement of both the legalentity boards and senior management in oversight and decisionmaking 

forwardlooking assessments of capital adequacy for us and for our banking subsidiaries feed development of capital plans that are submitted to the federal reserve board and other bank regulators we prepare these plans in full compliance with the federal reserve board’s capital plan rule and participate in the federal reserve board’s annual ccar stresstesting process both our banking subsidiaries and we also participate in semiannual stress tests required by the doddfrank act the federal reserve board may either object to our capital plan in whole or in part or provide a notice of nonobjection if the federal reserve board objects to our capital plan we may not make any capital distribution other than those with respect to which the federal reserve board has indicated its nonobjection 

beginning with 2013  our annual capital plans have included special transactions intended to optimize the level and mix of our regulatory capital to improve overall shareholder return and better align with the capital profiles of our peers from the 

 108 

citizens financial group inc 

managements discussion and analysis 

second quarter of 2013  through the fourth quarter of 2014  these special transactions reduced common equity by 20 billion and increased tier 2 subordinated debt by 20 billion with no impact on either the level of total regulatory capital or the total riskbased capital ratio the last of these transactions was executed on october 8 2014 when we repurchased 334 million of common shares from rbs and issued 334 million of tier 2 subordinated debt to rbsg we anticipate that our strategy of capital optimization will continue subject to regulatory approval and market conditions we intend to purchase an additional 500 million to 750 million of our shares of common stock in 2015  and 2016  which may include purchases from rbsg and we may continue to pair these repurchases with issuances of preferred stock subordinated debt or senior debt 

in march 2014 the federal reserve board objected on qualitative grounds to our capital plan submitted as part of the ccar process although we were permitted to continue capital actions at a level consistent with those executed in 2013  we are not permitted to increase our capital distributions above 2013  levels until the federal reserve board approves a new capital plan consistent with the federal reserve boards annual ccar requirement we submitted a new capital plan on january 5 2015 and expect to receive the federal reserve boards decision on future actions by march 11 2015 

during 2014  we completed the following capital actions 

 during 2013  we completed the following capital actions 

 after execution of these actions both common equity tier 1 and tier 1 capital calculated using fully phasedin basel iii definitions were 121  as of december 31 2014  well above their respective basel iii minima including the capital conservation buffer of 70  and 85  respectively our pro forma basel iii total riskbased capital ratio after giving effect to all basel iii impacts also remained strong at 154  versus the basel iii minimum including the capital conservation buffer of 105  these pro forma basel iii ratios are nongaap financial measures for more information on computation of these nongaap financial measures see “—principal components of operations and key performance metrics used by management — key performance metrics and nongaap financial measures”

banking subsidiaries capital 

the following table presents our banking subsidiaries capital ratios under the basel i capital framework in effect for us at december 31 2014 



cbna tier 1 riskbased capital ratio declined   70  basis points to 122  and the total riskbased capital ratio increased   30  basis points to 148  as compared to december 31 2013  the decline in the tier 1 riskbased capital ratio reflected an increase of 50 billion  in riskweighted assets for the year ended december 31 2014  attributable to growth in the consumer auto and commercial business lines of 23 billion and 34 billion respectively partially offset by runoff in consumer home equity products 

cbna tier 1 capital at 104 billion was flat compared with december 31 2013  reflecting increases due to net income of 820 million the amortization of the deferred tax liability for goodwill of 23 million and a minor movement in disallowed servicing assets of 4 million these increases were largely offset by decreases due to return of permanent capital of 660 million which was part of an exchange of permanent capital for tier 2 subordinated debt now held by us the payment of quarterly common dividendsreturns of 160 million and other deductions from tier 1 capital of 21 million 

cbna total capital increased 918 million as compared to december 31 2013  due to the issuance of 250 million of new tier 2 subordinated debt which was not associated with an exchange of permanent capital and the neutrality to total capital of the return of 660 million of permanent capital that was offset by the issuance of tier 2 subordinated debt other than these factors the increase in total capital reflected the same factors as tier 1 capital as well as a decrease in the allowance for credit losses of 25 million and other deductions from tier 2 capital of 21 million 

cbpa tier 1 riskbased capital ratio declined 300  basis points to 141  at december 31 2014  and the total riskbased capital ratio declined 160  basis points to 166  as compared to december 31 2013  the decline in the tier 1 riskbased capital ratio reflected an increase of 24 billion in riskweighted assets for the year ended december 31 2014 attributable to growth in retail automobile residential mortgage and commercial loans and leases of 12 billion 884 million and 378 million respectively 

cbpa tier 1 capital at 30 billion decreased 228 million as compared to december 31 2013  reflecting increases due to net income of 178 million and the amortization of the deferred tax liability for goodwill of 47 million these increases were more than offset by the return to us of permanent capital of 300 million which was part of an exchange of permanent capital for tier 2 subordinated debt now held by us and the payment of quarterly common dividends of 155 million 

cbpa total capital increased 94 million as compared to december 31 2013 due to the same factors impacting tier 1 capital with two exceptions the special dividends of 300 million that were offset by issuance of tier 2 subordinated debt was neutral to total capital while total capital increased due to an increase in the allowance for credit losses of 22 million 

because of the goodwill impairment recognized by cbna in the second quarter of 2013  cbna must request specific approval from the occ before executing capital distributions this requirement will remain in place through the fourth quarter of 2015  however as of december 31 2014  irrespective of the ability of our subsidiary banks to pay dividends on a nonconsolidated basis we had liquid assets in excess of 340 million  compared to an annual interest burden on existing subordinated debt of approximately 104 million

liquidity 

we define liquidity as an institution’s ability to meet its cashflow and collateral obligations in a timely manner at a reasonable cost an institution must maintain current liquidity to fund its daily operations and forecasted cashflow needs as well as contingent liquidity to deliver funding in a stress scenario we consider the effective and prudent management of liquidity to be fundamental to our health and strength 

we manage liquidity at the consolidated enterprise level and at each material legal entity including us cbna and cbpa 

cfg liquidity 

our primary sources of cash are i dividends and interest received from our banking subsidiaries as a result of investing in bank equity and subordinated debt and ii externally issued subordinated debt  350 million  our uses of liquidity include the following i routine cash flow requirements as a bank holding company including payments of dividends interest and expenses ii needs of subsidiaries including our banking subsidiaries for additional equity and as required their needs for debt financing and iii extraordinary requirements for cash such as acquisitions 

during 2014  we exchanged tier 1 common equity for tier 2 subordinated debt in the amount of 10 billion we will continue our strategy to optimize capital which could include additional purchases of our common stock andor issuances of preferred stock subordinated debt or senior debt as we increase subordinated debt in exchange for common equity our funding costs will increase to reflect the incremental debt service any issuance of preferred equity would reduce net income available to common stockholders but improve rotce 

our cash and cash equivalents represent a source of liquidity that can be used to meet various needs as of december 31 2014  and 2013 we held cash and cash equivalents of 340 million  and 494 million respectively this should be viewed as a liquidity reserve 

our liquidity risk is low for four reasons first we have no material nonbanking subsidiaries and our banking subsidiaries are selffunding second we have no outstanding senior debt at the cfg level third the capital structures of our banking subsidiaries are similar to our capital structure as of december 31 2014  our double leverage ratio the combined equity of our subsidiaries divided by our equity was 1017  fourth our other cash flow requirements such as operating expenses are relatively small 

banking subsidiaries’ liquidity 

in the ordinary course of business the liquidity of cbna and cbpa is managed by matching sources and uses of cash the primary sources of bank liquidity include i deposits from our consumer and commercial franchise customers ii payments of principal and interest on loans and debt securities and iii as needed and as described under “—liquidity risk management and governance” wholesale borrowings the primary uses of bank liquidity include i withdrawals and maturities of deposits ii payment of interest on deposits iii funding of loan commitments and iv funding of securities purchases to the extent that the banks have relied on wholesale borrowings uses also include payments of related principal and interest 

our banking subsidiaries’ major businesses involve taking deposits and making loans hence a key role of liquidity management is to ensure that customers have timely access to funds from deposits and loans liquidity management also involves maintaining sufficient liquidity to repay wholesale borrowings pay operating expenses and support extraordinary funding requirements when necessary 

during 2014  cbna and cbpa issued 910 million  and 300 million  in subordinated debt to us in exchange for common equity held by us respectively the increased proportion of subordinated debt versus common equity in the capital structure of cbna and cbpa will increase funding costs to reflect the incremental debt service costs 

from an external issuance perspective during 2014  we created a 30 billion global note program for our cbna bank subsidiary under this program on december 1 2014 cbna issued 15 billion in senior notes consisting of 750 million of threeyear fixedrate notes and 750 million in fiveyear fixedrate notes this debt represents a key source of unsecured term and stable funding further diversifies the funding sources of cbna and creates a more peerlike funding structure for the consolidated enterprise 

liquidity risk 

we define liquidity risk as the risk that we or either of our banking subsidiaries will be unable to meet our payment obligations in a timely manner we manage liquidity risk at the consolidated enterprise level and for each material legal entity including us cbna and cbpa liquidity risk can arise due to contingent liquidity risk andor funding liquidity risk 

 111 

citizens financial group inc 

managements discussion and analysis 

asset liquidity risk is the risk that market conditions may reduce an entity’s ability to liquidate pledge andor finance certain assets and thereby substantially reduce the liquidity value of such assets drivers of contingent liquidity risk include general market disruptions as well as specific issues regarding the credit quality andor valuation of a security or loan issuer or borrower andor asset class 

funding liquidity risk is the risk that market conditions andor entityspecific events may reduce an entity’s ability to raise funds from depositors andor wholesale market counterparties drivers of funding liquidity may be idiosyncratic or systemic reflecting impediments to operations andor undermining of market confidence 

  

factors affecting liquidity 

given the composition of their assets and borrowing sources contingent liquidity at both cbna and cbpa would be materially affected by such events as deterioration of financing markets for highquality securities eg mortgagebacked securities and other instruments issued by the government national mortgage association “gnma” federal national mortgage association “fnma” and the federal home loan mortgage corporation “fhlmc” by any incapacitation of the federal home loan banks “fhlbs” to provide collateralized advances andor by a refusal of the federal reserve board to act as lender of last resort in systemic stress given the quality of our free securities the positive track record of the fhlbs in stress and the commitment of the federal reserve board to continue as lender of last resort in systemic stress scenarios we view contingent liquidity risk at our banking subsidiaries both cbna and cbpa to be relatively modest 

given the structure of their balance sheets funding liquidity of cbna and cbpa would be materially affected by an adverse idiosyncratic event eg a major loss causing a perceived or actual deterioration in its financial condition an adverse systemic event eg default or bankruptcy of a significant capital markets participant or a combination of both eg the financial crisis of 20082010 however during the financial crisis our banking subsidiaries reduced their dependence on unsecured wholesale funding to virtually zero consequently and despite ongoing exposure to a variety of idiosyncratic and systemic events we view our funding liquidity risk to be relatively modest 

an additional variable affecting our access and the access of our banking subsidiaries to unsecured wholesale market funds and to large denomination ie uninsured customer deposits is the credit ratings assigned by such agencies as moody’s standard  poor’s and fitch the following table presents our credit ratings 



  nr  not rated 

changes in our public credit ratings could affect both the cost and availability of our wholesale funding as a result and in order to maintain a conservative funding profile our banking subsidiaries continue to minimize reliance on unsecured wholesale funding at december 31 2014  the majority of wholesale funding consisted of secured borrowings using highquality liquid securities sold under agreements to repurchase repurchase agreements and fhlb advances secured primarily by highquality residential loan collateral our dependence on shortterm unsecured and creditsensitive funding continues to be relatively low 

existing and evolving regulatory liquidity requirements represent another key driver of systemic liquidity conditions and liquidity management practices the federal reserve board evaluates our liquidity as part of the supervisory process and the federal reserve board recently issued regulations that will require us to conduct regular liquidity stress testing over various time horizons and to maintain a buffer of highly liquid assets sufficient to cover expected net cash outflows and projected loss or

managements discussion and analysis 

impairment of funding sources for a shortterm liquidity stress scenario in addition the basel committee has developed a set of internationallyagreed upon quantitative liquidity metrics the lcr and the nsfr 

the lcr was developed to ensure banks have sufficient highquality liquid assets to cover expected net cash outflows over a 30day liquidity stress period in september 2014 the us federal banking regulators published the final rule to implement the lcr this rule also introduced a modified version of the lcr in the united states which generally applies to bank holding companies not active internationally institutions with less than 10 billion of onbalance sheet foreign exposure with total assets of greater than 50 billion but less than 250 billion under this definition we are designated as a modified lcr company as compared to the basel committee’s version of the lcr the version of the lcr issued by the us federal banking regulators includes a narrower definition of highquality liquid assets different prescribed cash inflow and outflow assumptions for certain types of instruments and transactions and a shorter phasein schedule that begins on january 1 2015 and ends on january 1 2017 notably as a modified lcr company we are required to be 90 compliant beginning in january 2016 and 100 compliant beginning in january 2017 achieving sustainable lcr compliance may require changes in the size andor composition of our investment portfolio the configuration of our discretionary wholesale funding portfolio and our average cash position we were compliant with the lcr as of december 31 2014 and we expect to be fully compliant with the lcr as of the required implementation date of january 2016 

the nsfr was developed to provide a sustainable maturity structure of assets and liabilities and has a time horizon of one year the basel committee contemplates that the nsfr including any revisions will be implemented as a minimum standard by january 1 2018 however the us federal banking regulators have not yet published a final rule to implement the nsfr in the united states 

we continue to review these liquidity requirements and to develop implementation plans and liquidity strategies we expect to be fully compliant with the final rules on or prior to the applicable effective date 

liquidity risk management and governance 

liquidity risk is measured and managed by the wholesale funding and liquidity unit within our treasury unit in accordance with policy guidelines promulgated by our board and the asset and liability management committee in managing liquidity risk the wholesale funding and liquidity unit delivers regular and comprehensive reporting including current levels vs threshold limits for a broad set of liquidity metrics explanatory commentary relating to emerging risk trends and as appropriate recommended remedial strategies 

the mission of our wholesale funding and liquidity unit is to deliver prudent levels of current projected and contingent liquidity from stable sources in a timely manner and at a reasonable cost without significant adverse consequences 

we seek to accomplish this mission by funding loans with stable deposits by prudently controlling dependence on wholesale funding particularly shortterm unsecured funding and by maintaining ample available liquidity including a contingent liquidity buffer of unencumbered highquality loans and securities as of december 31 2014  

 the wholesale funding and liquidity unit monitors a variety of liquidity and funding metrics including specific risk threshold limits the metrics are broadly classified as follows 

  113 

citizens financial group inc 

managements discussion and analysis

critical accounting estimates 

our audited consolidated financial statements which are included elsewhere in this report are prepared in accordance with gaap the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to establish accounting policies and make estimates that affect amounts reported in our audited consolidated financial statements 

an accounting estimate requires assumptions and judgments about uncertain matters that could have a material effect on our audited consolidated financial statements estimates are made using facts and circumstances known at a point in time changes in those facts and circumstances could produce results substantially different from those estimates the most significant accounting policies and estimates and their related application are discussed below 

see note 1 “significant accounting policies” to our audited consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 — financial statements and supplementary data included elsewhere in this report for further discussion of our significant accounting policies 

allowance for credit losses 

management’s estimate of probable losses in our loan and lease portfolios including unfunded lending commitments is recorded in the allowance for loan and lease losses and the reserve for unfunded lending commitments at levels that we believe to be appropriate as of the balance sheet date our determination of such estimates is based on a periodic evaluation of the loan and lease portfolios and unfunded credit facilities as well as other relevant factors this evaluation is inherently subjective and requires significant estimates and judgments of underlying factors all of which are susceptible to change 

the allowance for loan and lease losses and reserve for unfunded lending commitments could be affected by a variety of internal and external factors internal factors include portfolio performance such as delinquency levels assigned risk ratings the mix and level of loan balances differing economic risks associated with each loan category and the financial condition of specific borrowers external factors include fluctuations in the general economy unemployment rates bankruptcy filings developments within a particular industry changes in collateral values and factors particular to a specific commercial credit such as competition business and management performance the allowance for loan and lease losses may be adjusted to reflect our current assessment 

 115 

citizens financial group inc 

managements discussion and analysis 

of various qualitative risks factors and events that may not be measured in our statistical procedures there is no certainty that the allowance for loan and lease losses and reserve for unfunded lending commitments will be appropriate over time to cover losses because of unanticipated adverse changes in any of these internal external or qualitative factors 

the evaluation of the adequacy of the commercial commercial real estate and lease allowance for loan and lease losses and reserve for unfunded lending commitments is primarily based on risk rating models that assess probability of default loss given default and exposure at default on an individual loan basis the models are primarily driven by individual customer financial characteristics and are validated against historical experience additionally qualitative factors may be included in the risk rating models after the aggregation of individual borrower incurred loss additional overlays can be made based on backtesting against historical losses and forward loss curve ratios 

for nonaccruing commercial and commercial real estate loans with an outstanding balance of 3 million or greater and for all commercial and commercial real estate tdrs regardless of size we conduct specific analysis on a loan level basis to determine the probable amount of credit loss if appropriate a specific allowance is established for the loan through a charge to the provision for credit losses for all classes of impaired loans individual loan measures of impairment may result in a chargeoff to the allowance for loan and lease losses if deemed appropriate in such cases the provision for credit losses is not affected when a specific reserve for at least that amount already exists techniques utilized include comparing the loan’s carrying amount to the estimated present value of its future cash flows the fair value of its underlying collateral or the loan’s observable market price the technique applied to each impaired loan is based on the workout officer’s opinion of the most probable workout scenario historically this has generally led to the use of the estimated present value of future cash flows approach the fair value of underlying collateral will be used if the loan is deemed collateral dependent for loans that use the fair value of underlying collateral approach a chargeoff assessment is performed quarterly to write the loans down to fair value 

for most nonimpaired retail loan portfolio types the allowance for loan and lease losses is based upon the incurred loss model utilizing the probability of default “pd” loss given default “lgd” and exposure at default on an individual loan basis when developing these factors we may consider the loan product and collateral type loantovalue “ltv” ratio lien position borrower’s credit time outstanding geographic location delinquency status and incurred loss period incurred loss periods are reviewed and updated at least annually and potentially more frequently when economic situations change rapidly as they tend to fluctuate with economic cycles incurred loss periods are generally longer in good economic times and shorter in bad times certain retail portfolios including sbo home equity loans student loans and commercial credit card receivables utilize roll rate models to estimate the alll for the portfolios measured using the incurred loss model roll rate models are also run as challenger models and can used to support management overlays if deemed necessary 

for home equity lines and loans a number of factors impact the pd specifically the borrower’s current fico score the utilization rate delinquency statistics borrower income current combined loantovalue ratio and months on books are all used to assess the borrower’s creditworthiness similarly the loss severity is also impacted by various factors including the utilization rate the combined loantovalue ratio the lien position the housing price index change for the location as measured by the caseshiller index months on books and current loan balance 

when we are not in a first lien position we use delinquency information on the first lien exposures obtained from thirdparty credit information providers in the credit assessment for all first liens whether owned by a third party or by us an additional assessment is performed on a quarterly basis in this assessment the most recent three months’ performance of the senior liens is reviewed for delinquency 90 days or more past due modification foreclosure andor bankruptcy statuses if any derogatory status is present the junior lien will be placed on nonaccrual status regardless of its delinquency status on our books this subsequent change to nonaccrual status will alter the treatment in the pd model thus affecting the reserve calculation 

in addition the first lien exposure is combined with the second lien exposure to generate a combined loantovalue “cltv” the cltv is a more accurate reflection of the leverage of the borrower against the property value as compared to the ltv from just the junior liens the cltv is used for modeling both the junior lien pd and lgd this also impacts the allowance for loan loss rates for the junior lien helocs 

the above measures are all used to assess the pd and lgd for heloc borrowers for whom we originated the loans there is also a portfolio of home equity products that were originated and serviced by others however we currently service some of the loans in this portfolio the sbo portfolio is modeled as a separate class and the reserves for this class are generated by using the delinquency roll rate models as described below 

for retail tdrs that are not collateraldependent allowances are developed using the present value of expected future cash flows compared to the recorded investment in the loans expected redefault factors are considered in this analysis retail tdrs that are deemed collateraldependent are written down to the fair market value of the collateral less costs to sell the fair value of collateral is periodically monitored subsequent to the modification

changes in the levels of estimated losses even if minor can significantly affect management’s determination of an appropriate allowance for loan and lease losses for consumer loans losses are affected by such factors as loss severity collateral values economic conditions and other factors a 1 and 5 increase in the estimated loss rate for consumer loans at december 31 2014  would have increased the allowance by 5 million  and 27 million  respectively the allowance for loan and lease losses for our commercial banking segment is sensitive to assigned credit risk ratings and inherent loss rates if 10 and 20 of the december 31 2014  year ending loan balances including unfunded commitments within each risk rating category of our commercial banking segment had experienced downgrades of two risk categories the allowance for loan and lease losses would have increased by 30 million  and 59 million  respectively 

commercial loans and leases are charged off to the allowance when there is little prospect of collecting either principal or interest chargeoffs of commercial loans and leases usually involve receipt of borrowerspecific adverse information for commercial collateral dependent loans an appraisal or other valuation is used to quantify a shortfall between the fair value of the collateral less costs to sell and the recorded investment in the commercial loan retail loan chargeoffs are generally based on established delinquency thresholds rather than borrowerspecific adverse information when a loan is collateraldependent any shortfalls between the fair value of the collateral less costs to sell and the recorded investment is promptly charged off placing any loan or lease on nonaccrual status does not by itself require a partial or total chargeoff however any identified losses are charged off at that time

fair value 

we measure fair value using the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date fair value is based upon quoted market prices in an active market where available if quoted prices are not available observable marketbased inputs or independently sourced parameters are used to develop fair value whenever possible such inputs may include prices of similar assets or liabilities yield curves interest rates prepayment speeds and foreign exchange rates 

we classify our assets and liabilities that are carried at fair value in accordance with the threelevel valuation hierarchy 

 classification in the hierarchy is based upon the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement of the asset or liability for instruments classified in level 1 and 2 where inputs are primarily based upon observable market data there is less judgment applied in arriving at the fair value for instruments classified in level 3 management judgment is more significant due to the lack of observable market data 

significant assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis include our mortgagebacked securities available for sale these instruments are priced using an external pricing service and are classified as level 2 within the fair value hierarchy the service’s pricing models use predominantly observable valuation inputs to measure the fair value of these securities under both the market and income approaches the pricing service utilizes a matrix pricing methodology to price our us agency passthrough securities which involves making adjustments to tobeannounced security prices based on a matrix of various mortgagebacked securities characteristics such as weightedaverage maturities indices and other poollevel information other agency and nonagency mortgagebacked securities are priced using a discounted cash flow methodology this methodology includes estimating the cash flows expected to be received for each security using projected prepayment speeds and default rates based on historical statistics of the underlying collateral and current market conventions these estimated cash flows are then discounted using marketbased discount rates that incorporate characteristics such as average life volatility ratings performance of the underlying collateral and prevailing market conditions 

we review and update the fair value hierarchy classifications on a quarterly basis changes from one quarter to the next related to the observability of inputs in fair value measurements may result in a reclassification between the fair value hierarchy levels and are recognized based on yearend balances we also verify the accuracy of the pricing provided by our primary external pricing service on a quarterly basis this process involves using a secondary external vendor to provide valuations for our securities

portfolio for comparison purposes any securities with discrepancies beyond a certain threshold are researched and if necessary valued by an independent outside broker 

fair value is also used on a nonrecurring basis to evaluate certain assets for impairment or for disclosure purposes examples of nonrecurring uses of fair value include mortgage servicing rights accounted for by the amortization method loan impairments for certain loans and goodwill 

for additional information regarding our fair value measurements see note 1 “significant accounting policies” note 3 “securities” note 9 “mortgage banking” and note 15 “derivatives” to our audited consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 — financial statements and supplementary data included elsewhere in this report 

goodwill 

goodwill is an asset that represents the future economic benefits arising from other assets acquired in a business combination that are not individually identified and separately recognized goodwill is not amortized but is subject to annual impairment tests goodwill is assigned to reporting units at the date the goodwill is initially recorded a reporting unit is a business operating segment or a component of a business operating segment once goodwill has been assigned to reporting units it no longer retains its association with a particular acquisition and all of the activities within a reporting unit whether acquired or organically grown are available to support the value of the goodwill 

the goodwill impairment analysis is a twostep test the first step used to identify potential impairment involves comparing each reporting unit’s fair value to its carrying value including goodwill if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value applicable goodwill is deemed to be not impaired if the carrying value exceeds fair value there is an indication of impairment and the second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment 

the second step involves calculating an implied fair value of goodwill for each reporting unit for which the first step indicated impairment the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination which is the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit as determined in the first step over the aggregate fair values of the individual assets liabilities and identifiable intangible assets as if the reporting unit were being acquired in a business combination if the implied fair value of goodwill exceeds the carrying value of goodwill assigned to the reporting unit there is no impairment if the carrying value of goodwill assigned to a reporting unit exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill an impairment charge is recorded for the excess an impairment loss recognized cannot exceed the amount of goodwill assigned to a reporting unit and the loss establishes a new basis in the goodwill subsequent reversal of goodwill impairment losses is not permitted 

we review goodwill for impairment annually as of october 31 or more often if events or circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of one or more reporting units is below its carrying value we rely on the income approach discounted cash flow method as the primary method for determining fair value marketbased methods are used as benchmarks to corroborate the value determined by the discounted cash flow method 

we rely on several assumptions when estimating the fair value of our reporting units using the discounted cash flow method these assumptions include the current discount rate as well as projected loan losses income taxes and capital retention rates discount rates are estimated based on the capital asset pricing model which considers the riskfree interest rate market risk premium beta and unsystematic risk and size premium adjustments specific to a particular reporting unit the discount rates are also calibrated on the assessment of the risks related to the projected cash flows of each reporting unit multiyear financial forecasts are developed for each reporting unit by considering several key business drivers such as new business initiatives customer retention standards market share changes anticipated loan and deposit growth forward interest rates historical performance and industry and economic trends among other considerations the longterm growth rate used in determining the terminal value of each reporting unit was estimated based on management’s assessment of the minimum expected terminal growth rate of each reporting unit as well as broader economic considerations such as gross domestic product and inflation 

we corroborate the fair value of our reporting units determined by the discounted cash flow method using marketbased methods a comparable company method and a comparable transaction method the comparable company method measures fair value of a business by comparing it to publicly traded companies in similar lines of business this involves identifying and selecting the comparable companies based on a number of factors ie size growth profitability risk and return on investment calculating the market multiples ie pricetotangible book value pricetocash earnings and pricetonet income of these comparable companies and then applying these multiples to our operating results to estimate the value of the reporting unit’s equity on a marketable minority basis a control premium is then applied to this value to estimate the fair value of the reporting unit on a marketable controlling basis the comparable transaction method measures fair value of a business based on exchange prices in actual transactions and on asking prices for controlling interests in public or private companies currently offered for sale the process involves comparison and correlation of us with other similar companies adjustments for differences in factors described earlier ie size growth profitability risk and return on investment are also considered 

 118 

citizens financial group inc 

managements discussion and analysis 

as a best practice we also corroborate the fair value of our reporting units determined by the discounted cash flow method by adding the aggregated sum of these fair value measurements to the fair value of our nonsegment operations and comparing this total to our observed market capitalization as part of this process we analyze the implied control premium to evaluate its reasonableness all facts and circumstances are considered when completing this analysis including observed transaction data and any additional external evidence supporting the implied control premium 

the valuation of goodwill is dependent on forwardlooking expectations related to the performance of the us economy and our associated financial performance the prolonged delay in the full recovery of the us economy and the impact of that delay on earnings expectations prompted a goodwill impairment test as of june 30 2013 although the us economy has demonstrated signs of recovery notably improvements in unemployment and housing the pace and extent of recovery in these indicators as well as in overall gross domestic product have lagged previous expectations the impact of the slow recovery is most evident in our consumer banking reporting unit accordingly the percentage by which the estimated fair value of our consumer banking reporting unit exceeded its carrying value declined from 7 at december 31 2011  to 5 at december 31 2012  

during the first half of 2013  we observed further deceleration of expected growth for our consumer banking reporting unit’s future profits based on forecasted economic growth for the us economy and the continuing impact of the new regulatory framework in the financial industry this deceleration was incorporated into our revised earnings forecast in the second quarter of 2013 and we subsequently concluded that there was a likelihood of greater than 50 that goodwill impairment had occurred as of june 30 2013 

an interim goodwill impairment test was subsequently performed for our consumer banking and commercial banking reporting units step one of these tests indicated that 1 the fair value of our consumer banking reporting unit was less than its carrying value by 19 and 2 the fair value of our commercial banking reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by 27 step two of the goodwill impairment test was subsequently performed for our consumer banking reporting unit which resulted in the recognition of a pretax 44 billion impairment charge in our consolidated statement of operations for the period ending june 30 2013 the impairment charge which was a noncash item had minimal impact on our tier 1 riskbased and total riskbased capital ratios the impairment charge had no impact on our liquidity position or tangible common equity 

we performed an annual test for impairment of goodwill for both reporting units as of october 31 2014 as of this testing date the percentage by which the fair value of our consumer banking reporting unit exceeded its carrying value was 12 and the percentage by which the fair value of our commercial banking reporting unit exceeded its carrying value was 9 

we based the fair value estimates used in our annual goodwill impairment testing on assumptions we believe to be representative of assumptions that a market participant would use in valuing the reporting units but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain including estimates of future growth rates and operating margins and assumptions about the overall economic climate and the competitive environment for our reporting units there can be no assurances that future estimates and assumptions made for purposes of goodwill testing will prove accurate predictions of the future if the assumptions regarding business plans competitive environments or anticipated growth rates are not achieved we may be required to record goodwill impairment charges in future periods

income taxes 

accrued income taxes are reported as a component of either other assets or other liabilities as appropriate in the consolidated balance sheets and reflect our estimate of income taxes to be paid or that effectively have been prepaid deferred income tax assets and liabilities represent the amount of future income taxes to be paid or that effectively have been prepaid and the net balance is reported as an asset or liability in the consolidated balance sheets we determine the realization of the deferred tax asset based upon an evaluation of the four possible sources of taxable income 1 the future reversals of taxable temporary differences 2 future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards 3 taxable income in prior carryback years and 4 tax planning strategies in projecting future taxable income we utilize forecasted pretax earnings adjust for the estimated book tax differences and incorporate assumptions including the amount of income allocable to taxing jurisdictions these assumptions require significant judgment and are consistent with the plans and estimates that we use to manage the underlying businesses the realization of the deferred tax assets could be reduced in the future if these estimates are significantly different than forecasted 

we are subject to income tax in the united states and multiple state and local jurisdictions the tax laws and regulations in each jurisdiction may be interpreted differently in certain situations which could result in a range of outcomes thus we are required to exercise judgment regarding the application of these tax laws and regulations we evaluate and recognize tax liabilities

related to any tax uncertainties due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties the ultimate resolution may differ from the current estimate of tax liabilities or refunds 

our estimate of accrued income taxes deferred income taxes and income tax expense can also change in any period as a result of new legislative or judicial guidance impacting tax positions as well as changes in income tax rates any changes if they occur can be significant to our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows

risk governance 

we are committed to maintaining a strong integrated and proactive approach to the management of all risks to which we are exposed in pursuit of our business objectives a key aspect of our board’s responsibility as the main decision making body is setting our risk appetite to ensure that the levels of risk that we are willing to accept in the attainment of our strategic business and financial objectives are clearly understood 

to enable the board to carry out its objectives it has delegated authority for risk management activities as well as governance and oversight of those activities to a number of board and executive management level risk committees the key committees that specifically consider risk across the enterprise are set out in the diagram below 

  

chief risk officer 

the chief risk officer “cro” directs our overall risk management function overseeing the compliance regulatory operational and credit risk management in addition the cro has oversight of the management of market liquidity and strategic risks the cro reports to our ceo and board risk committee 

risk framework 

our risk management framework is embedded in our business through a “three lines of defense” model which defines responsibilities and accountabilities 

 120 

citizens financial group inc 

managements discussion and analysis 

first line of defense 

the business lines including their associated support functions are the first line of defense and are accountable for owning and managing within our defined risk appetite the risks which exist in their respective business areas the business lines are responsible for performing regular risk assessments to identify and assess the material risks that arise in their area of responsibility complying with relevant risk policies testing and certifying the adequacy and effectiveness of their controls on a regular basis establishing and documenting operating procedures and establishing and owning a governance structure for identifying and managing risk 

  

second line of defense 

the second line of defense includes independent monitoring and control functions accountable for developing and ensuring implementation of risk and control frameworks oversight of risk financial management and valuation and regulatory compliance this centralized risk function is appropriately independent from the business and is accountable for overseeing and challenging our business lines on the effective management of their risks this risk function utilizes training communications and awareness to provide expert support and advice to the business lines this includes interpreting the risk policy standards and risk management framework overseeing compliance by the businesses with policies and responsibilities including providing relevant management information and escalating concerns where appropriate 

the executive risk committee chaired by the cro actively considers our inherent material risks analyzes our overall risk profile and seeks confirmation that the risks are being appropriately identified assessed and mitigated 

third line of defense 

our internal audit function is the third line of defense acting as an independent appraisal and assurance function as an independent assurance function internal audit ensures the key business risks are being managed to an acceptable level and that the risk management and internal control framework is operating effectively independent assessments are provided to our audit committee on a monthly basis and to the board and executive management in the form of quarterly opinions 

risk appetite 

risk appetite is a strategic business and risk management tool we define our risk appetite as the maximum limit of acceptable risk beyond which we would either be unable to achieve our strategic objectives and capital adequacy obligations or would assume an unacceptable amount of risk to do so the board risk committee advises our board of directors in relation to current and potential future risk strategies including determination of risk appetite and tolerance 

  

the principal nonmarket risks to which we are subject are credit risk operational risk liquidity risk strategic risk and reputational risk we are also subject to market risks market risk refers to potential losses arising from changes in interest rates foreign exchange rates equity prices commodity prices andor other relevant market rates or prices market risk does not result from proprietary trading which we prohibit rather modest market risk arises from trading activities that serve customer needs including hedging of interest rate and foreign exchange risk as described below more material market risk arises from our nontrading banking activities such as loan origination and deposit gathering we have established enterprisewide policies and methodologies to identify measure monitor and report market risk we actively manage both trading and nontrading market risks we are also subject to liquidity risk discussed under “—liquidity” 

our risk appetite framework and risk limit structure establishes guidelines to determine the balance between existing and desired levels of risk and supports the implementation measurement and management of our risk appetite policy

credit risk 

overview 

credit risk represents the potential for loss arising from a customer counterparty or issuer failing to perform in accordance with the contractual terms of the obligation while the majority of our credit risk is associated with lending activities we do engage with other financial counterparties for a variety of purposes including investing asset and liability management and trading activities given the financial impact of credit risk on our earnings and balance sheet the assessment approval and management of credit risk represents a major part of our overall riskmanagement responsibility 

objective 

the credit risk management organization is responsible for approving credit transactions monitoring portfolio performance identifying problem loans and ensuring remedial management 

organizational structure 

management and oversight of credit risk is the responsibility of both the line of business and the second line of defense the second line of defense the independent credit risk function is led by the chief credit officer “cco” who oversees all of our credit risk the cco reports to the chief risk officer the cco acting in a manner consistent with board policies has responsibility for among other things the governance process around policies procedures risk acceptance criteria credit risk appetite limits and authority delegation the cco and his team also have responsibility for credit approvals for larger or more risky transactions and oversight of line of business credit risk activities reporting to the cco are the heads of the second line of defense credit functions specializing in consumer banking business banking and commercial banking as well as the head of citizens restructuring management each team under these leaders is comprised of highly experienced credit professionals 

the credit risk teams operate independently from the business lines to ensure decisions are not influenced by unbalanced objectives each team is comprised of senior credit officers who possess extensive experience structuring and approving loans 

governance 

the primary mechanisms used to govern our credit risk function are our consumer and commercial credit policies these policies outline the minimum acceptable lending standards that align with our desired risk appetite material issues or changes are identified by the individual committees and presented to the combined credit risk committee executive risk committee and the board for approval as required 

key management processes 

to ensure credit risks are managed within our risk appetite and business and risk strategies are achieved we employ a comprehensive and integrated control program the program’s objective is to proactively 1 identify 2 measure 3 monitor and 4 mitigate existing and emerging credit risks across the lifecycle origination account managementportfolio management and loss mitigation and recovery 

on the consumer banking side of credit risk our teams use models to evaluate consumer loans across the lifecycle of the loan starting at origination credit scoring models are used to forecast the probability of default of an applicant these models are embedded in the loan origination system which allows for realtime scoring and automated decisions for many of our products periodic validations are performed on our purchased and proprietary scores to ensure fit for purpose when approving customers for a new loan or extension of an existing credit line credit scores are used in conjunction with other credit risk variables such as affordability length of term collateral value collateral type and lien subordination 

the origination process is supported by dedicated underwriting teams that reside in the business line the size of each team depends on the intensity of the approval process as the number of handoffs documentation and verification requirements differ substantially depending on the loan product 

to ensure proper oversight of the underwriting teams lending authority is granted by credit risk to each underwriter the amount of delegated authority depends on the experience of the individual we periodically evaluate the performance of each underwriter and annually reauthorize their delegated authority only senior members of the credit risk team are authorized to grant significant exceptions to credit policies it is not uncommon to make exceptions to established policies when compensating factors are present these exceptions are capped at 5 of origination volume and tracked separately to ensure performance expectations are achieved 

once an account is established credit scores and collateral values are refreshed at regular intervals to allow for proactive identification of increasing or decreasing levels of credit risk for accounts with contingent liability revolving feature credit 

 122 

citizens financial group inc 

managements discussion and analysis 

policies have been developed that leverage the refreshed customer data to determine if a credit line should be increased decreased frozen or closed lastly behavioral modeling segmentation and loan modifications are used to cure delinquency reduce the severity of loss and maximize recoveries our approach to managing credit risk is highly analytical and where appropriate is automated to ensure consistency and efficiency 

one of the central tools used to manage credit risk is the consumer and small business credit risk dashboard this dashboard is refreshed monthly and evaluates key dimensions of credit risk against defined control parameters commonly referred to as inner and outer limits inner limits are designed to alert senior management of unfavorable trends with sufficient lead time to address and implement corrective actions before the risks increase in materiality outer limits represent the maximum risk tolerance which if breached would necessitate immediate escalation and corrective action all limits are recalibrated annually and aligned with pro forma budget expectations and desired risk profile 

the credit risk team is constantly evaluating current and projected economic conditions internal credit performance in relation to budget and predefined risk tolerances and current and expected regulatory guidance to determine the optimal balance of expansion and contraction policies all policy change proposals receive intense scrutiny and syndication prior to approval and implementation this process ensures decisions are made based on profit based analytics with full consideration to operational and regulatory risks 

on the commercial banking side of credit risk the structure is broken into commercial  industrial loans and leases and commercial real estate within commercial  industrial there are separate verticals established for certain specialty products eg assetbased lending leasing franchise finance health care technology midcorporate a “specialty vertical” is a standalone team of industry or product specialists substantially all activity that falls under the ambit of the defined industry or product is managed through a specialty vertical when one exists commercial real estate also operates as a specialty vertical 

commercial credit risk management begins with defined credit products and policies new credit products and material changes to existing credit products require multiple levels of review and approval the initial level of review involves the engagement of risk disciplines from across the enterprise for a new product risk assessment this assessment process reviews the product description strategic rationale and financial impact and considers the risk impact from multiple perspectives reputation operational regulatory market legal as well as credit 

commercial transactions are subject to individual analysis and approval at origination and with few exceptions are subject to a formal annual review requirement the underwriting process includes the establishment and approval of credit grades that confirm the probability of default “pd” and loss given default “lgd” approval then requires both a business line approver and an independent credit approver the approval level is determined by the size of the credit relationship as well as the pd with larger relationships and weaker pd’s requiring the approval of more senior individuals the checks and balances in the credit process and the independence of the credit approver function are designed to appropriately assess and sanction the level of credit risk being accepted facilitate the early recognition of credit problems when they occur and to provide for effective problem asset management and resolution all authority to grant credit is delegated through the independent credit risk function and is closely monitored and regularly updated 

the primary factors considered in commercial credit approvals are the financial strength of the borrower assessment of the borrower’s management capabilities cash flows from operations industry sector trends type and sufficiency of collateral type of exposure transaction structure and the general economic outlook while these are the primary factors considered there are a number of other factors that may be considered in the decision process in addition to the credit analysis conducted during the approval process at origination and annual review our credit quality assurance group performs testing to provide an independent review and assessment of the quality of the portfolio and new originations this group conducts portfolio reviews on a riskbased cycle to evaluate individual loans validate risk ratings as well as test the consistency of the credit processes 

the maximum level of credit exposure to individual credit borrowers is limited by policy guidelines based on the perceived risk of each borrower or related group of borrowers concentration risk is managed through limits on industry sector loan type asset class and loan quality factors we focus predominantly on extending credit to commercial customers within our primary banking markets although we will consider lending opportunities outside our primary markets if we believe that the associated risks are acceptable and aligned with strategic initiatives geographic considerations occur at both the transactional level as well as the product level as certain specialties operate on a national basis 

our management of risk concentrations includes the establishment of sector and asset class limits we have identified 32 sectors and established limits for 16 that we have deemed meaningful by virtue of size or inherent risk these sector limits are reviewed and approved annually exposure against these limits is tracked on a monthly basis the two largest sector concentrations are industrials and cre 

apart from industrials and cre which together make up 29 of the commercial utilization as of december 31 2014 we do not have any major sector concentrations the industrial sector includes basic commercial and industrial “ci” lending

focused on general manufacturing the sector is diversified and not managed as a specialized vertical our customers are local to our market and present no significant concentration we have a smaller concentration in cre than our peer banks based on industry data obtained from snl financial as of september 30 2014 our cre outstandings amounted to 11 of total outstanding loans according to snl financial the corresponding ratio for peer banks was 18 

our credit grading system considers many components that directly correlate to loan quality and likelihood of repayment our assessment of a borrower’s credit strength is reflected in our risk ratings for such loans which are an integral component of our allowance for loan and lease losses methodology when deterioration in credit strength is noted a loan becomes subject to watch review the watch review process involves senior representatives from the business line portfolio management team the independent credit risk team and our citizens restructuring management group as appropriate and consistent with regulatory definitions the credit may be subject to classification as either criticized or classified which would also trigger a credit rating downgrade as such the loan and relationship would be subject to more frequent review 

substantially all loans categorized as classified are managed by citizens restructuring management citizens restructuring management is a specialized group of credit professionals that handles the daytoday management of workouts commercial recoveries and problem loan sales its responsibilities include developing and implementing action plans assessing risk ratings determining the appropriateness of specific reserves relating to the loan accrual status of the loan and the ultimate collectability of loans in their portfolio 

market risk 

market risk refers to potential losses arising from changes in interest rates foreign exchange rates equity prices commodity prices andor other relevant market rates or prices market risk does not result from proprietary trading which we prohibit rather modest market risk arises from trading activities that serve customer needs including hedging of interest rate and foreign exchange risk as described below more material market risk arises from our nontrading banking activities such as loan origination and depositgathering we have established enterprisewide policies and methodologies to identify measure monitor and report market risk we actively manage both trading and nontrading market risks 

nontrading risk 

we are exposed to market risk as a result of nontrading banking activities this market risk is comprised entirely of interest rate risk as we have no direct currency equity or commodity risk this interest rate risk emerges from the balance sheet after the aggregation of our assets liabilities and equity we refer to this nontrading risk embedded in the balance sheet as “structural interest rate risk” or “interest rate risk in the banking book” our mortgage servicing rights assets also contain interest rate risk as the value of the fee stream is impacted by the level of longterm interest rates 

a major source of structural interest rate risk is a difference in the repricing of assets on the one hand and liabilities and equity on the other first there are differences in the timing of rate changes reflecting the maturity andor repricing of assets and liabilities for example the rate earned on a residential mortgage may be fixed for 30 years the rate paid on a certificate of deposit may be fixed only for a few months due to these timing differences net interest income is sensitive to changes in the level and shape of the yield curve second there are differences in the drivers of rate changes of various assets and liabilities for example commercial loans may reprice based on onemonth libor or prime the rate paid on retail money market demand accounts may be only loosely correlated with libor and depend on competitive demand for funds due to these basis differences net interest income is sensitive to changes in spreads between certain indices or repricing rates 

another important source of structural interest rate risk relates to the potential exercise of explicit or embedded options for example most consumer loans can be prepaid without penalty and most consumer deposits can be withdrawn without penalty the exercise of such options by customers can exacerbate the timing differences discussed above 

a primary source of our structural interest rate risk relates to faster repricing of floating rate loans relative to the retail deposit funding this source of asset sensitivity is concentrated at the short end of the yield curve given the very low level of shortterm interest rates this risk is asymmetrical with significantly more upside benefit than potential exposure the secondary source of our interest rate risk is driven by longer term rates comprising the rollover or reinvestment risk on fixed rate loans as well as the prepayment risk on mortgage related loans and securities funded by nonrate sensitive deposits and equity 

the primary goal of interest rate risk management is to control exposure to interest rate risk within policy limits approved by the board these limits and guidelines reflect our tolerance for interest rate risk over both shortterm and longterm horizons to ensure that exposure to interest rate risk is managed within this risk appetite we must both measure the exposure and as 

 124 

citizens financial group inc 

managements discussion and analysis 

necessary hedge it the treasury asset and liability management team is responsible for measuring monitoring and reporting on the structural interest rate risk position these exposures are reported on a monthly basis to the asset and liability committee and at board meetings 

we measure structural interest rate risk through a variety of metrics intended to quantify both shortterm and longterm exposures the primary method that we use to quantify interest rate risk is simulation analysis in which we model net interest income from assets liabilities and hedge derivative positions under various interest rate scenarios over a threeyear horizon exposure to interest rate risk is reflected in the variation of forecasted net interest income across scenarios 

key assumptions in this simulation analysis relate to the behavior of interest rates and spreads the changes in product balances and the behavior of loan and deposit clients in different rate environments the most material of these behavioral assumptions relate to the repricing characteristics and balance fluctuations of deposits with indeterminate ie noncontractual maturities as well as the pace of mortgage prepayments 

as the future path of interest rates cannot be known in advance we use simulation analysis to project net interest income under various interest rate scenarios including a “most likely” implied forward scenario as well as a variety of deliberately extreme and perhaps unlikely scenarios these scenarios may assume gradual ramping of the overall level of interest rates immediate shocks to the level of rates and various yield curve twists in which movements in short or longterm rates predominate generally projected net interest income in any interest rate scenarios is compared to net interest income in a base case where market forward rates are realized 

the table below reports net interest income exposures against a variety of interest rate scenarios exposures are measured as a percentage change in net interest income over the next year due to either instantaneous or gradual parallel  200 basis point moves in benchmark interest rates the net interest income simulation analyses do not include possible future actions that management might undertake to mitigate this risk the current limit is an adverse change of 10 related to an instantaneous  200 basis point move as the table illustrates our balance sheet is assetsensitive net interest income would benefit from an increase in interest rates exposure to a decline in interest rates is well within limit it should be noted that the magnitude of any possible decline in interest rates is constrained by the low absolute starting levels of rates while an instantaneous and severe shift in interest rates was used in this analysis we believe that any actual shift in interest rates would likely be more gradual and would therefore have a more modest impact 

the table below summarizes our positioning in various parallel yield curve shifts 



as part of the routine risk management process a wide variety of similar analyses are reported for each of the next three rolling years 

as recommended by bank regulators cbpa also uses a valuation measure of exposure to structural interest rate risk economic value of equity as a supplement to net interest income simulations nevertheless multiyear net interest income simulation is the main tool for managing structural interest rate risk 

 125

managements discussion and analysis 

as noted the balance sheet is assetsensitive positioned to benefit from an increase in interest rates the magnitude of this assetsensitivity has been reduced from more elevated levels at the end of 2012  and early 2013 at that time the extremely low levels of medium to longterm interest rates presented a poor risktoreward tradeoff for transactions that would add asset duration as a result the investment portfolio was reduced in size increasing assetsensitivity subsequently intermediate and longterm interest rates have risen and we resumed portfolio investment moderating the aggregate assetsensitivity of the balance sheet 

we also had market risk associated with the value of the mortgage servicing right assets which are impacted by the level of interest rates as of december 31 2014  and december 31 2013  our mortgage servicing rights had a book value of 166 million  and 185 million  respectively and were carried at the lower of cost or fair value as of december 31 2014  and december 31 2013  the fair value of the mortgage servicing rights was 179 million  and 195 million  respectively given low interest rates over recent years there is a valuation allowance of 18 million  and 23 million  on the asset as of december 31 2014  and december 31 2013  respectively depending on the interest rate environment hedges may be used to stabilize the market value of the mortgage servicing right asset 

trading risk 

we are exposed to market risk primarily through client facilitation activities including derivatives and foreign exchange products exposure is created as a result of the implied volatility and spreads of a select range of interest rates foreign exchange rates and secondary loans these trading activities are conducted through our two banking subsidiaries cbna and cbpa 

client facilitation activities consist primarily of interest rate derivatives and foreign exchange contracts where we enter into offsetting trades with a separate counterparty or exchange to manage our exposure to the customer historically the majority of these offsetting trades have been with rbs we will occasionally execute hedges against the spread that exists across the client facing trade and its offset in the market to maintain a low risk profile in 2014  we commenced a secondary loan trading desk with the objective to meet secondary liquidity needs of our issuing clients’ transactions and investor clients we do not engage in any proprietary trading to benefit from price differences between financial instruments and markets 

we record interest rate derivatives and foreign exchange contracts as derivative assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets trading assets and liabilities are carried at fair value with income earned related to these activities included in net interest income changes in fair value of trading assets and liabilities are reflected in other income a component of noninterest income on the consolidated statements of operations 

market risk governance   

our market risk framework currently leverages rbsg technology platform to aggregate measure and monitor exposure against market risk limits as part of our separation from rbs group we have entered into a transitional services agreement pursuant to which rbsg will continue to provide us with all necessary valueatrisk “var” and other risk measurements required for regulatory reporting related to interest rate derivatives and foreign exchange trading activities as well as internal market risk reporting and general consultative services related to our market risk framework until the end of the transitional services agreement during the term of the transitional services agreement we intend to build out our own market risk organization and framework in order to gradually migrate away from reliance on services provided by rbsg as part of this process we hired a new head of market risk management to begin building out our standalone capabilities with respect to market risk management 

given the low level of market risk and substantial market risk expertise at our parent we have received the support of our us banking regulators for relying on rbs group’s market risk expertise in managing our market risk dealing authorities represent a key control in the management of market risk by setting the scope within which the business is permitted to operate dealing authorities are established jointly by designated senior business line and senior risk manager and are reviewed at least annually dealing authorities are structured to accommodate the client facing trades market offset trades and sets of hedges needed to maintain a low risk profile primary responsibility for keeping within established tolerances resides with the business key risk indicators including a combined var for interest rate and foreign exchange rate risk are monitored on a daily basis and reported against tolerances consistent with our risk appetite and business strategy to relevant business line management and risk counterparts 

market risk measurement 

we use var metrics complemented with sensitivity analysis market value and stress testing in measuring market risk during the term of the transition services agreement we will continue to leverage rbsg market risk measurement models for our foreign exchange and interest rate products which are described further below that capture correlation effects and allow for

aggregation of market risk across risk types business lines and legal entities we measure and monitor market risk for both management and regulatory capital purposes 

valueatrisk overview 

  rbsg market risk measurement model is based on historical simulation the var measure estimates the extent of any fair value losses on trading positions that may occur due to broad market movements general var such as changes in the level of interest rates foreign exchange rates equity prices and commodity prices it is calculated on the basis that current positions remain broadly unaltered over the course of a given holding period it is assumed that markets are sufficiently liquid to allow the business to close its positions if required within this holding period var’s benefit is that it captures the historic correlations of a portfolio based on the composition of our “covered positions” we also use a standardized addon approach for the loan trading desk’s specific risk capital which estimates the extent of any losses that may occur from factors other than broad market movements in addition for our secondary traded loans we calculate the var on the general interest rate risk embedded within the loans using a standalone model that replicates rbs group general var methodology the related capital is reflected on the “de minimis” line in the following section rbsg general var approach is expressed in terms of a confidence level over the past 500 trading days the internalvar measure used as the basis of the main var trading limits is a 99 confidence level with a one day holding period meaning that a loss greater than the var is expected to occur on average on only one day in 100 trading days ie 1 of the time theoretically there should be a loss event greater than var two to three times per year the regulatory measure of var is done at a 99 confidence level with a 10day holding period the historical market data applied to calculate the var is updated on a 10 business day lag refer to “market risk regulatory capital” below for details of our 10day var metrics for the quarters ended december 31 2014  and december 31 2013  including high low average and period end valueatrisk for interest rate and foreign exchange rate risks as well as total var we began measuring the high low and average valueatrisk for interest rate and foreign exchange currency rate risk during the fourth quarter of 2013  in conjunction with incorporating tradelevel detail for foreign exchange risk in our market risk measurement models prior to that time var for foreign exchange exposure was calculated using a manual process that did not capture potential interest rate risk from any forward transactions 

market risk regulatory capital   

effective january 1 2013 the us banking regulators adopted “riskbased capital guidelines market risk” as the regulations covering the calculation of market risk capital the “market risk rule” the market risk rule commonly known as basel 25 substantially modified the determination of market riskweighted assets and implemented a more risk sensitive methodology for the risk inherent in certain trading positions categorized as “covered positions” for the purposes of the market risk rule all of our client facing trades market offset trades and sets of hedges needed to maintain a low risk profile qualify as “covered positions” the internal var measure is calculated based on the same population of trades that is utilized for regulatory var the following table shows the results of our modeled and nonmodeled measures for regulatory capital calculations

managements discussion and analysis 

stress var   

stress var “svar” is an extension of var but uses a longer historical look back horizon that is fixed from january 1 2005 this is done not only to identify headline risks from more volatile periods but also to provide a counter balance to var which may be low during periods of low volatility the holding period for profit and loss determination is 10 days svar is also a component of market risk regulatory capital svar for us is calculated under its own dynamic window regime as compared to rbsg’s static svar window in a dynamic window regime values of the 10day 99 var are calculated over all possible 260day periods that can be obtained from the complete historical data set refer to “market risk regulatory capital” above for details of svar metrics including high low average and period end svar for the combined portfolio we began measuring the high low and average svar for our combined portfolio during the fourth quarter of 2013  in conjunction with the incorporation of tradelevel detail for foreign exchange risk in our market risk measurement models prior to that time our svar measure did not include foreign exchange risk given low levels of materiality 

sensitivity analysis   

sensitivity analysis is the measure of exposure to a single risk factor such as a one basis point change in rates or credit spread we conduct and monitor sensitivity on interest rates basis spreads foreign exchange exposures and option prices whereas var is based on previous moves in market risk factors over recent periods it may not be an accurate predictor of future market moves sensitivity analysis complements var as it provides an indication of risk relative to each factor irrespective of historical market moves and is an effective tool in evaluating the appropriateness of hedging strategies 

stress testing   

conducting a stress test of a portfolio consists of running risk models with the inclusion of key variables that simulate various historical or hypothetical scenarios for historical stress tests profit and loss results are simulated for selected time periods corresponding to the most volatile underlying returns while hypothetical stress tests aim to consider concentration risk illiquidity under stressed market conditions and risk arising from the bank’s trading activities that may not be fully captured by its other models hypothetical scenarios also assume that the market moves happen simultaneously and that no repositioning or hedging activity takes place to mitigate losses as events unfold we generate stress tests of our trading positions on a regular basis for example we currently include a stress test that simulates a lehmantype crisis scenario by taking the worst 10day peak to trough moves for the various risk factors that go into var from that period and assuming they occurred simultaneously 

var model review and validation   

market risk measurement models used are independently reviewed rbsg models used under the transitional services agreement are subject to ongoing and independent review and validation that focuses on the model methodology independent review of market risk measurement models is the responsibility of rbs group risk analytics “gra” aspects covered include challenging the assumptions used the quantitative techniques employed and the theoretical justification underpinning them and an assessment of the soundness of the required data over time where possible the quantitative impact of the major underlying modeling assumptions will be estimated eg through developing alternative models results of such reviews are shared with us regulators for the term of the transitional services agreement we and rbsg expect to utilize the same independently validated var model for both management and regulatory reporting purposes rbs market risk teams including those providing consultative services to us under the transitional services agreement will conduct internal validation before a new or changed model element is implemented and before a change is made to a market data mapping for example rbs market risk teams also perform regular reviews of key risk factors that are used in the market risk measurement models to produce profit and loss vectors used in the var calculations these internal validations are subject to independent revalidation by group risk analytics and depending on the results of the impact assessment notification to the appropriate regulatory authorities for rbsg and us may be required

var backtesting   

backtesting is one form of validation of the var model the market risk rule requires a comparison of our internal var measure to the actual net trading revenue excluding fees commissions reserves intraday trading and net interest income for each day over the preceding year the most recent 250 business days any observed loss in excess of the var number is taken as an exception the level of exceptions determines the multiplication factor used to derive the var and svarbased capital requirement for regulatory reporting purposes we perform subportfolio backtesting as required under the market risk rule and as approved by our banking regulators for interest rate and foreign exchange positions the following table shows our daily net trading revenue and total internal modeled var for the quarters ending december 31 2014  september 30 2014 june 30 2014 and march 31 2014 we continue to utilize a multiplication factor derived from rbs backtesting results as agreed with our banking regulators in the following table the march 11 2014 var spike of 588 thousand is primarily due to a timing issue on the reflection of one foreign currency time deposit maturity into our demand deposit account in our market risk feed
